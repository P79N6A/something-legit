According to reports, some users of Windows 10 Insider build 18865 have found that Microsoft is testing the Edge Insider build withing the Windows Sandbox feature.\nWindows Sandbox is a new feature that was added to Windows 10 build 1903 (19H1) that allows users to execute programs in a sandboxed environment that has no affect on your normal system. This allows users to test applications to make sure they do not perform unwanted activity before being allowed on the normal Windows install.\nAccording to deskmodder.de , there are reports that some Windows Insiders are being added to a test that installs Microsoft Edge Insider version 75.0.111.0 in the Windows Sandbox as shown below. As you can see from the image, this browser is the Chromium-based insider build. Microsoft Edge Insider version 75.0.111.0 installed in Windows Sandbox (Source: Deskmodder)\nFor those users who were added to the A/B test, they will find a Microsoft Edge icon on their desktop that is transparent compared to the normal icon with a blue background. The files associated with the Microsoft Edge Insider build will be located in C:\\Users\\WDAGUtilityAccount\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Edge . C:\\Users\\WDAGUtilityAccount\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Edge Folder (Source: Deskmodder)\nOther who are not part of the test have found that the folder exists, but it is empty. Unfortunately, I cannot confirm whether the reports are true as I do not have the C:\\Users\\WDAGUtilityAccount\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Edge folder at all. My missing Edge Folder\nBleepingComputer has tried numerous tests to get the Edge Insider preview to trigger in Windows Sandbox including reinstalling numerous times, trying different insider accounts, and installing the feature from a German IP address. Unfortunately, nothing has worked at this time.\nWe will continue to monitor the Windows Sandbox feature for updated images and Edge installs and will update this article if anything changes. If you are running Windows 10 Insider build 18865, let us know if the Edge Insider preview is installed in Windows Sandbox for you.

I take it as a hopeful sign that Microsoft\u2019s spending more time to get the bugs ironed out before delivering the \u201coptional non-security\u201d Win10 patch. (It\u2019s \u201coptional\u201d in the sense that you\u2019ll only get it if you click on \u201cCheck for updates.\u201d)\nThere are five irritating, acknowledged bugs in Win10 1809 that haven\u2019t been fixed yet: IE 11 authentication issues Audio devices stop working unexpectedly MSXML6 may freeze the system Custom URI schemes may not work correctly Windows Deployment Services PXE may not work\nOther versions of Win10 have some of the same bugs, introduced by earlier patches. [ Got a spare hour? Take this online course and learn how to install and configure Windows 10 with the options you need. ] Just what Windows 7 needs \u2013 another round of 'Get Windows 10' nags\nWe\u2019re covering the demise of Windows 7 intently over on AskWoody . But there\u2019s one thing you definitely don\u2019t need \u2013 another nagging patch from Microsoft. KB 4493132 , a Win7 patch that does nothing bug nag, is definitely worth skipping.\nWe have some late-breaking news from Michael Horowitz that Win7 now has a scheduled task called refreshgwxconfig-B that seems to be associated with the widely despised \u201cGet Windows X\u201d campaign. It\u2019s not clear at this point where the unwanted task came from. Win10 1809 now ready for prime time, with 1903 on its heels\nMicrosoft changes its Windows updating terminology capriciously and with absolutely no consideration for settings baked into earlier versions of Win10. But never mind. With word from on high that Win10 version 1809 has been deemed worthy of business deployment , we also have assurances that we\u2019ll get similar confirmation for Win10 versions from 1903 onward. (And that makes me wonder whether we\u2019ll have yet another change in terminology soon.)\nIn general, March\u2019s patches seem quite tame. Let\u2019s hope that\u2019s the new normal.\nQuestions answered and discussions dissed on the AskWoody Lounge .

Consumer Tech Tech enthusiast, born in Ann Arbor and educated at Michigan State Share to facebook A Microsoft building in Greece / Photo credit: Getty Getty \"Microsoft Monday\" is a weekly column that focuses on all things Microsoft. This week, \u201cMicrosoft Monday\u201d features news about the new Surface Book 2, 500 patents getting donated to startups, a bug on Skype for Android that answers calls getting fixed and more! New Surface Book 2 Surface Book 2 Microsoft Microsoft has announced a new version of the Surface Book 2 with the latest quad-core processor from Intel. This means the new 13-inch Surface Book 2 model has Intel\u2019s latest 8th Gen quad-core i5 processor. And the existing Surface Book 2 with a dual-core 7th Gen process will remain at a price of $1,299. The Surface Book 2 with the quad-core processor is priced at $1,499. T he new Surface Book 2 also has 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. On April 17th, Microsoft will be hosting a Surface event in New York City. At the event, Microsoft is reportedly going to unveil pricing and availability for its Surface Hub 2 hardware and office furniture made in collaboration with Steelcase according to The Verge . 500 Patents Donated To Startups Last week, Microsoft announced a big expansion of the Azure IP Advantage program, which helps Azure users that are dealing with intellectual property lawsuits. This program also provides users who are building applications that connect to Azure with access to 10,000 patents. Plus Microsoft is also donating 500 patents to startups in the LOT Network. The LOT Network is a nonprofit organization that was created to combat patent trolls. Some of the LOT members include Microsoft, Google, Red Hat, Uber, Ford, Facebook, Netflix, SAP, Dropbox, Mazda, General Motors, Honda, JPMorgan Chase, CBS, and Epic Games. There are nearly 400 members in the organization. And qualified startups who join the LOT Network can buy Microsoft patents to own them outright. These startups have to meet a $1,000 per month Azure spend. The patents cover a wide range of technologies and geographies. \u201cWe want to help the LOT Network grow its network of startups,\u201d said Microsoft CVP and Deputy General Counsel Erich Andersen via TechCrunch . \u201cTo provide an incentive, we are going to provide these patents to them.\u201d Windows 10 October 2018 Broad Deployment Begins The Windows 10 October 2018 update is now ready for broad deployment, according to a company blog post . Also known as version 1809, Windows 10 October 2018 will be launching next month. \"Based on the data and the feedback we\u2019ve received from consumers, OEMs, ISVs, partners, and commercial customers, Windows 10, version 1809 has transitioned to broad deployment. With this, the Windows 10 release information page will now reflect Semi-Annual Channel (SAC) for version 1809. We will continue to communicate for future releases the transition from targeted to broad deployment status,\u201d said Microsoft\u2019s John Wilcox. Version 1809 was unveiled at IFA in August 2018 as the replacement for version 1803. Version 1809 included screenshot improvements, SwiftKey keyboard for Windows 10 and the Your Phone app. Microsoft ended up having to pull the update due to files getting deleted spontaneously. And then Microsoft quickly patched that bug and attempted to roll out another fix, but there were other bugs that surfaced. Skype For Android Bug May Answer Phone Calls According to Android Police , Skype is working on fixing a bug that automatically answers incoming calls under certain circumstances. This problem first started surfacing on Microsoft\u2019s support forums in January. Skype for Android has an option to automatically pick up phone calls in the Settings, but the bug is causing the app to still answer even while this feature is off. A number of users said that the Skype app for Android stop picking up calls automatically after they disconnected their smartwatches from their devices. However, Android users without smartwatches are still experiencing this issue. Microsoft acknowledged the bug and a fix is being worked on now. Disrupting Iranian Hacker Group Microsoft's Forensics Lab Microsoft Last week, court documents were unsealed detailing the work that Microsoft\u2019s Digital Crimes Unit conducted to disrupt cyberattacks from an Iran-based threat group called Phosphorus \u2014 which is also known as APT 35, Charming Kitten and Ajax Security Team. Microsoft\u2019s CVP of Customer Security & Trust Tom Burt said that the court case against Phosphorus filed in the U.S. District Court for Washington D.C. resulted in a court order that enabled the company to take control of 99 websites that the group uses to conduct its hacking operations so that it can no longer be used for executing attacks. The Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) and Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) divisions have been tracking Phosphorus since 2013. The activity that Phosphorus conducts is usually designed for gaining access to the computer systems of businesses and government agencies for stealing sensitive information. And they also target activists and journalists especially the ones involved in reporting on issues related to the Middle East. \u201cPhosphorus typically attempts to compromise the personal accounts of individuals through a technique known as spear-phishing, using social engineering to entice someone to click on a link, sometimes sent through fake social media accounts that appear to belong to friendly contacts. The link contains malicious software that enables Phosphorus to access computer systems,\u201d wrote Burt . \"Phosphorus also uses a technique whereby it sends people an email that makes it seem as if there\u2019s a security risk to their accounts, prompting them to enter their credentials into a web form that enables the group to capture their passwords and gain access to their systems.\u201d These attack methods use websites that incorporate the names of big name brands in order to appear authentic. Some of the websites used by Phosphorus include outlook-verify.net, yahoo-verify.net and verification-live.com. Microsoft worked with Yahoo to share threat information and the two companies jointly stopped attacks. And Microsoft worked with each domain listing company listed in its suit prior to filing it. This case is similar to the cases that Microsoft filed against another hacker group called Strontium. This approach was used 15 times to take control of 91 fake websites that were associated with Strontium. New Microsoft 365 Features Microsoft\u2019s Corporate Vice President for Microsoft 365 Kirk Koenigsbauer published a blog post highlighting all the new features that were added to Microsoft 365 in March. Here is an overview of the new features: There are new intelligent inking features in the Microsoft Whiteboard Windows 10 app for improving the collaborative ideation experience. You can take a picture of a physical whiteboard and it gets converted to digital ink in the Whiteboard app using ink grab. And the ink beautification feature helps to increase the readability of jotted notes by analyzing handwriting and automatically replacing it with more legible strokes. These features are now available in the Whiteboard Windows 10 app. When you securely connect your LinkedIn account with your Office 365 account, you can work seamlessly with first-degree LinkedIn connections and view others\u2019 LinkedIn profiles in Outlook on the web, and in OneDrive and SharePoint in Office 365. And you can see relevant insights about the people you are working with, both inside and outside your organization. Target Release customers can now send emails to and coauthor documents with many of their first-degree LinkedIn connections. You can get started by typing a connection\u2019s name in the To or Cc field when composing a new message or sharing a document in Outlook on the web, Word Online, PowerPoint Online, Excel Online, SharePoint and OneDrive. And there are new features for Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook on the web. You can make presentations stand out with 3D objects and animations on the Mac and create stunning visuals on Word, Excel and PowerPoint. And this improves comprehension and retention and increases engagement. You can insert scenes and 3D models from a library of free content and rotate 3D objects at every angle. The 3D objects feature on Mac is going to become available for Insiders next month. Outlook on the web has new intelligent features to prepare for and schedule meetings faster. For example, Outlook on the web helps you prepare for meetings by showing you relevant information you might need. And it will also automatically suggest that you create a meeting directly from an email conversation and show you available days and times for people you include in a meeting invite. These features are going to start rolling out to Outlook on the web users in the next few weeks. And now you can manage your Microsoft 365 services with the next Microsoft 365 admin center. Recently, Microsoft announced that the Microsoft 365 admin center will start rolling out as the default experience for all Microsoft 365 and Office 365 admins. The Microsoft 365 admin center is designed to serve as a single entry point for managing services across Windows 10, Office 365, and Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS). Some of the additional updates include a Yammer tab option for a Teams channel, an option to open Office 365 documents directly in the desktop apps, Microsoft Forms Pro arriving in public preview, support for syncing edits of files embedded in your notebooks on OneNote and the custom policies feature in Azure Active Directory B2C becoming generally available \u2014 which gives you more control over identity experiences to help you deliver personalized user journeys in customer-facing applications.\nWhat are your thoughts about this article?

Zacks Equity Research Cancel Read More Hide Full Article\nMicrosoft ( MSFT - Free Report ) closed the most recent trading day at $118.89, moving +0.81% from the previous trading session. The stock lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.16%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 1.27%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 1.29%.\nHeading into today, shares of the software maker had gained 5.28% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.18% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.92% in that time.\nMSFT will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $1, up 5.26% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $29.83 billion, up 11.24% from the year-ago period.\nFor the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.41 per share and revenue of $123.87 billion, which would represent changes of +13.66% and +12.24%, respectively, from the prior year.\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for MSFT. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.14% higher. MSFT is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\nDigging into valuation, MSFT currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 26.72. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 30.62.\nAlso, we should mention that MSFT has a PEG ratio of 2.16.

There is little doubt that they offer some stunning hardware, but after being the first PC maker to jump on Intel\u2019s Skylake platform, and then being burned by the power management issues that chipset had, they\u2019ve been more cautious with their offerings ever since. Thanks to their somewhat unusual launch windows, that can mean that they use older hardware for longer. Such was the case with the Surface Book 2 when it launched in 2017. The Core i7 model shipped with the 8th generation Intel Core, meaning Kaby Lake Refresh, which means quad-core over the dual-core in Kaby Lake. But the Core i5 model shipped with a dual-core Kaby Lake i5-7300U processor, meaning it had a sizeable performance delta to the top tier model \u2013 far greater than we typically see in a Core i5 to Core i7 comparison.\nMicrosoft Surface Book 2 13.5 No GPU 13.5 GPU 15 CPU Intel Core i5-7300U\nDual-Core w/Hyperthreading\n2.6-3.5 GHz 3MB Cache 15W TDP\nIntel Core i5-8350U\nQuad-Core w/Hyperthreading\n1.7-3.6 GHz 6MB Cache 15W TDP Intel Core i7-8650U\nQuad-Core w/Hyperthreading\n1.9-4.2 GHz 8MB Cache 15W TDP RAM 8GB LPDDR3 8-16 GB LPDDR3 16 GB LPDDR3 GPU Intel HD 620 Intel HD 620 + NVIDIA GTX 1050 2GB Intel HD 620 + NVIDIA GTX 1060 6GB Storage 128, 256 GB NVMe 256GB, 512 GB, 1TB Display 13.5\" PixelSense\n3000x2000 3:2 sRGB\nTouch and Pen enabled 15\" PixelSense\n3240x2160 3:2 sRGB\nTouch and Pen enabled Networking 802.11ac 2x2:2 866Mbps max\nBluetooth 4.1\nMarvell AVASTAR Audio Stereo Speakers (front facing)\nDolby Audio Premium Battery 23 Wh (Tablet) plus 46 Wh (Base) 23 Wh (Tablet) plus 52 Wh (Base) 23 Wh (Tablet) plus 63 Wh (Base) Xbox Wireless No Yes Right Side Surface Connect\nUSB Type-C 3.1 Gen 1 with USB Power Delivery\nHeadset Jack Left Side 2 x USB 3.0 Type-A\nSD Card Reader Dimensions 312 x 232 x 13-23mm\n12.3 x 9.14 x 0.51-0.90 inches 343 x 251 x 15-23 mm\n13.5 x 9.87 x 0.57-0.90 inches Weight 1.53 kg\n3.38 lbs 1.64 kg\n3.62 lbs 1.90 kg\n4.2 lbs Cameras 8.0 MP Rear-facing camera with autofocus\n5.0 MP front-facing camera with 1080p video\nWindows Hello IR camera Pricing $1149-$1499 $1999-$2999 $2499-$3200 Without any fanfare at all, Microsoft has started offering a quad-core Intel Core i5-8350U in the 13.5-inch Surface Book 2 option, taking the pricing bracket that the dual-core i5-7300U used to fill. For the moment, the dual-core is still available, and gets a discount of $200 to $1299. In addition, the dual-core model can also be had with a 128 GB SSD, cutting the price again to $1149. That\u2019s a significant price drop compared to the original $1499 retail price.\nThe Surface Book 2 is one of the best laptops on the market, offering a combination of utility and performance that is not really matched by any other device. The quad-core i5 update is a welcome addition, but of course the real question is why didn\u2019t it just ship with it to start with.\nThe updated Surface Book 2 is available on the Microsoft Store.\nSource: Windows Central", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

Processor, 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM By 0\nWhen Microsoft first announced its Surface Book 2 lineup , it was perplexing as to why it\u2019s base variant came with a dual-core 7th Gen Intel Core i5. There is a quad-core 8th Gen Intel Core i7 model, but it is priced significantly higher, forcing many potential buyers to either get stuck with a dual-core CPU or look for better alternatives. Well, Microsoft seems to have rectified the problem by silently adding a new model to its Surface Book 2 lineup with a quad-core 8th Gen Intel Core i5 this time around. New Surface Book 2 Specifications\nThe newly added Surface Book 2 with the 8th Gen Intel Core i5 chipset is only offered with the laptop\u2019s 13-inch variant. To be more specific, the CPU being used on the new model is an 8th Gen Intel Core i5-8350U CPU. This is a four core, eight thread processor that has a base frequency of 1.7 GHz and a Max Turbo frequency of 3.6 GHz. It ships with 6MB of cache and up to a 25-watt TDP. This model comes with 8GB of RAM paired with 256GB of storage.\nAll the rest of the specifications remain the same where a 13.5-inch 3000 x 2000 resolution PixelSense display is found. There is an 8MP camera at the back, while a 5MP camera is located at the front. The display is a touchscreen, and the keyboard can be detached. This is a backlight keyboard with key travel of 1.5mm. For connectivity, the laptop offers 2 USB Type-A ports, 1 USB Type-C port, SD card slot, Surface connect, and a headphone jack. Unlike the Core i7 model, however, this model does not come with discrete graphics and relies on Intel HD Graphics 620. Surface Book 2 Price\nSurprisingly, Microsoft has priced the new 8th Gen i5 Surface Book 2 at $1,499 (around INR 1,04,000) which is what the older 7th Gen i5 model was launched at. Now, the older model retails at a discounted price of $1,299 (around INR 90,000). There is also a 128GB storage model of the 7th Gen i5 model which sells for $1,149 (around INR 80,000). Meanwhile, the highest end configuration of the 15-inch Surface Book 2 with its 8th Gen i7, Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU, 16GB RAM, and 1TB storage costs $3,299 (approx. INR 2,29,000).

The directive has been set to ensure that institutions create a secure environment within cyberspace for the financial services industry and generate adequate trust and confidence in ICT systems as well as transactions in the cyberspace. It is also meant to strengthen the regulatory framework for ensuring a secure environment within cyberspace, amongst others. The event, which brought together stakeholders in the financial services including representatives of the Bank of Ghana, discussed the status of cyber security in the region as well as Microsoft\u2019s commitment to comply with Ghana\u2019s cyber security directive. It was aimed to provide a forum where stakeholders in the Financial Services Industry could discuss global best practices in cyber security and also explore the implementation of the policy set out. Microsoft, demonstrated the methodology for managing and handling cyber security challenges, which comply with international standards such as National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and ISO 2700 Opening the workshop, Government Affairs Director, Microsoft Nigeria and Ghana, Rimini Makama stated that success in advancing cyber security required a multi-stakeholder approach. She said governments around the world were having very crucial conversations on cyber security, which were resulting in more policies to improve cyber security-related risk management globally. She added \u2018we live in a time where technology is greatly impacting how we live, from the way we work, connect with each other to how we see our world. To succeed in this privacy-focused era, organizations need a trusted partner who can help you not only overcome the challenges but make the most of the opportunities that lie ahead\u2019. The event also aimed to equip the banks with the tools, knowledge, and understanding to benchmark, assess, and improve their enterprise risk management programme. Within the past year, the financial services industry has seen great change in Ghana and has particularly increased spotlight on the financial services industry as the plight against cybercrime remains ever-changing. \u201cTo be able to present to those in attendance and see their interest was rather exciting. Like Microsoft, Innovare shares the commitment to privacy and security of an individual\u2019s data. Both parties believe that the digital information our customers create and store using cloud services is and remains the property of the customer and is entitled to the same privacy protection as paper records sent by mail or stored in a safe,\u201d says CK Bruce, CEO at Innovare. John Edokpolo, Lead Commercial Attorney for Microsoft Emerging Markets, said \u201cAs organisations transform digitally, they need to be able to trust their technology solutions providers that are partnering with them to shape that transformation. \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s cloud platform and solutions lead the industry in security, privacy practices and compliance with major regulations and standards. We have earned the trust of companies and organisations worldwide of all sizes and across all industries in this regard, and we are excited to share global best practices with the FSI industry in Ghana today\u201d. He said both Microsoft and Innovare were excited at the possibilities and awareness that the workshop would bring going forward. \u201cBeing compliant to regulations set out in the region will only mean that organisations are able to carry out business as usual and be thoroughly protected against any attempts that threaten data privacy and security. \u201cOur approach to cloud services and transparency provides customers with confidence their data will be kept secure, private and meet industry compliance requirements. We hope that Ghana and the rest of the continent going forward, will embrace these technologies as they remain compliant in their day to day organisational activities,\u201d Mr Edokpolo added.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "microsoft microsoft", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bank of ghana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "financial services industry", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ghana", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T07:53:37.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cece647a65a5c7de11bf7ae3817c734da7fa635a", "url": "https://community.dynamics.com/business/b/businesscentraldevitpro/archive/2019/04/02/business-central-april-2019-release", "site_full": "community.dynamics.com", "site": "dynamics.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["windows", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Business Central April 2019 Update and the road ahead - Microsoft Dynamics Blog", "title_full": "Business Central April 2019 Update and the road ahead - Microsoft Dynamics Blog", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.012, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5967, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cece647a65a5c7de11bf7ae3817c734da7fa635a", "url": "https://community.dynamics.com/business/b/businesscentraldevitpro/archive/2019/04/02/business-central-april-2019-release", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Eva Dupont Msft", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Business Central April 2019 Update and the road ahead - Microsoft Dynamics Blog", "text": "By Eva Dupont\nAt Directions Asia this week, we announced the availability of the latest major update of Dynamics 365 Business Central. The Release Notes summarize the 100+ improvements we\u2019ve added in this update.\nTo enhance the simplicity of Business Central and optimize our ability to rapidly deliver innovation, we have outlined the following roadmap guidance: The focus of our user experience innovation is in our modern web and mobile clients, and our embedded Outlook add-in. For October 2019, we are investing to make these modern client experiences the first choice for any user role. The April 2019 update that was announced Monday is the last version that will support the legacy Windows client. Our partners and our developers demand a modern development environment, with easy integration to standard tools like GitHub and Azure DevOps. With the October 2019 update, we will move to Visual Studio Code and ship our application as AL. We are investing to add features to our Visual Studio Code development experience to make it more productive for developers compared to the C/SIDE environment that it will replace. The April 2019 update contains the last on-premises version with the C/SIDE development environment, and includes the last distribution of Business Central as C/AL code. Combined with the native capabilities of Visual Studio Code and the connection to other modern development tools, these changes will accelerate innovation in the product and across the ecosystem.\nThe April 2019 update delivers capabilities beyond the 100+ specific features, including improved performance, reliability, accessibility and supportability. Check out the next evolution of Business Central now , and stay tuned for more information on best practices for moving forward with modern clients, Visual Studio Code, and AL.\nOn behalf of the Dynamics 365 Business Central team,\nClaus Busk Andersen ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "github", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T10:57:52.034+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2dd33d52a0240809357cc8d4fbd988b3b30ab862", "url": "https://hypebeast.com/2019/4/nike-air-foamposite-pro-hyper-crimson-release-624041-800", "site_full": "hypebeast.com", "site": "hypebeast.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["fashion", "style_and_fashion"], "section_title": "", "title": "Nike Air Foamposite Pro \"Hyper Crimson\" Release | HYPEBEAST", "title_full": "Nike Air Foamposite Pro \"Hyper Crimson\" Release | HYPEBEAST", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "https://image-cdn.hypb.st/https%3A%2F%2Fhypebeast.com%2Fimage%2F2019%2F04%2Ftw-nike-air-foamposite-pro-hyper-crimson-release-info-624041-800.jpg?w=960&cbr=1&q=90&fit=max", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7576, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 46, "comments": 0, "shares": 7}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2dd33d52a0240809357cc8d4fbd988b3b30ab862", "url": "https://hypebeast.com/2019/4/nike-air-foamposite-pro-hyper-crimson-release-624041-800", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sophie Caraan", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Nike Air Foamposite Pro \"Hyper Crimson\" Release | HYPEBEAST", "text": "0 Comments\nNike is welcoming a \u201cHyper Crimson\u201d colorway to the Air Foamposite Pro family.

Next time code is compiled using the \u2014incremental flag, TypeScript will use that saved information from the previous compilation to only perform necessary type checks and changes, reducing how long the process takes.\nThis will result in a slightly longer initial compilation time, followed by faster build times for subsequent compilations.\nUsing the \u2014incremental flag, Microsoft says it was able to reduce build times for its Visual Studio Code editor, which is written in TypeScript, to approximately one fifth of what it was originally.\nOne of the biggest benefits TypeScript offers over JavaScript is type safety, its ability for the compiler to check the data types passed to and returned from functions and ensure they match what's expected. Doing so allows a whole category of errors that could slip through unnoticed in JavaScript to be detected by TypeScript before the code is deployed.\nIn previous versions of TypeScript that type safety would be lost when when passing one generic function to another generic function as an argument. TypeScript 3.4 fixes this issue, ensuring type safety remains in place.\nRead-only arrays can also now be defined using slightly simpler syntax, by applying a readonly modifier to an array declaration, for example, readonly string[] .The readonly modifier can also be applied to tuples , a type of array where the number of elements is known and can be of mixed types, for example, readonly [string, string] .\nThere's also a new way of carrying out type assertion, of specifying the type of a variable to the compiler, using the const keyword, which will also automatically assign readonly properties to object and array literals.\nIn TypeScript, setting and accessing variables that are defined globally, rather than locally within the current module, can be carried out using the globalThis variable, and TypeScript 3.4 introduces support for type checking on the globalThis variable.\nYou can read more about the new features and some of the breaking changes the update introduces here .\nMicrosoft publishes a roadmap for TypeScript, and has outlined plans to introduce negated types and strongly typed iterators and generators in TypeScript 3.5, due out in May.\nIf you want to get started with TypeScript then check out TechRepublic's guide to the best free resources for learning the language online .

Alamy 2 Unreleased versions of Microsoft's Windows were found when police searched Clark's computers\nThe two companies estimated that his hacks had cost them \u00a32.9 million, but confirmed that no customer data had been compromised.\nHe was handed a 15-month jail term, suspended for 18 months, after admitting five counts of computer hacking, the South East regional organised crime unit said.\nThe judge ruled that Clark's autism as well as his \"face blindness\" -- a condition that makes it significantly more difficult for a person to recognise others from their facial features -- meant he would \"suffer disproportionality if he went to prison,\" according to The Verge .\nJudge Alexander Milne also commended Clark's parents, who submitted a letter detailing plans for his supervision and rehabilitation. Reuters 2 Nintendo says that is has introduced new security procedures since this breach took place\nDetective Sergeant Gary Hooks, from the unit's cyber crime team, said: \"Although Clark didn't access any personal customer information, he repeatedly demonstrated intent to gather private information in full knowledge that his actions were illegal.\n\"This case again shows that no organisation is immune to hacking.\n\"Cyber security is not a victimless crime and Clark was aware of the investigation into the initial incident with Microsoft, but continued to commit further offences.\n\"We are therefore glad to secure a conviction for both cases.

SUSE is working with Microsoft to get environments up to 60TB in size.\nAll aboard the Enterprise As for why Microsoft and not the other bringers of fluffy white public cloud, Nelson told us the Windows giant \"historically does a very good job of embracing the enterprise\". And AWS and Google? \"Neither of them has that kind of enterprise background.\"\nSUSE CEO Nils Brauckmann agreed, and told us: \"Microsoft is much more open to run[ning] a different operating system on their cloud because what they're interested in is to have those customers running on their, not on Amazon's, infrastructure.\"\nWell, quite.\nNelson had some bad news for Linux-on-the-desktop obsessives, saying that while the Linux wrangler enjoyed a \"a long-running and rich desktop environment\", such a thing was \"not the core focus of our business\". The gang are all about the enterprise, with development efforts targeting the likes of Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry.\nThe love-in was reciprocated by Microsoft.

Instead of having to understand the layers of training that go into the ResNet50 deep learning neural network, or how to build learning platforms using TensorFlow or Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) , these services are just APIs that are ready to use. Microsoft has already trained the neural nets for these services, and it continues to tune them and use real-world operations as a foundation for future improvements. They\u2019re cheap to use compared to the compute and storage cost of building and running your own machine learning algorithms. [ Avoid machine learning failures: 6 ways to make machine learning fail . \u2022 Machine learning lessons: 5 companies share their mistakes . ]\nThe machine learning tools on Azure have rapidly become an important resource for anyone wanting to add basic artificial intelligence to an app. It\u2019s important to know that they are limited, with a focus on three key areas: computer vision, text analysis, and speech recognition. They\u2019re all important areas, but they are a limited subset of what can be done with modern machine learning. Azure Cognitive Services enters a new AI area\nFortunately, the first new cognitive service to explore other aspects of machine learning entered beta recently: adding anomaly detection to the roster . Anomaly detection is an important AI tool, analyzing time-series data for items that are outside normal operating characteristics for the data source. That makes it an extremely flexible tool because modern businesses have a lot of streamed data, from financial transactions to software logs to device telemetry. The ability to use one API to work across all these different feeds shouldn\u2019t be underestimated, because it makes building appropriate software a lot easier.\nNormally anomaly detection takes time to set up. You need to train your model against a large amount of data to determine what\u2019s normal operation and what\u2019s out of the ordinary. It\u2019s how credit-card fraud-detection systems build a model of your spending (and of all their customers\u2019 habits) to detect when a compromised card is used and to block any future transactions to keep losses to a minimum.

If you hit a compute resource problem, SQL Monitor provides a set of built-in Azure metrics that will help you determine very quickly which resource is the constraint and which database is the primary consumer of that resource.\nThe specialized Azure metrics are in addition to the common set of database metrics and alerts that SQL Monitor provides for any other SQL Server database. You can use the latter to investigate the underlying cause of poor performance in any Azure SQL Database. Using the history that SQL Monitor stores for you, you'll also be able to distinguish long-term trends from point-in-time issues, allowing you to make well-informed decisions on the need to \"buy more resources.\" The Azure service will happily provision more compute resources according to how much you pay, but this isn't the right answer if it's a problem that you can fix by tuning a query or adding an index.\nResource Allocation for Azure SQL Elastic Pools Grant Fritchey's Monitoring Azure SQL Databases article discusses the basics of compute size and DTU allocation for Azure SQL databases, so I won't repeat that here. Very similar rules apply for Azure SQL Elastic Pools ; the DTU allocation per database is unaffected, but now we have an overall eDTU limit for the pool. A 200 eDTU elastic pool , for example, provides the same compute size as an S4 (200 DTU) Azure SQL Database. Of course, now those 200 DTUs are shared by however many databases you have in the pool.\nThere is some additional cost to pooling: eDTUs are 1.5x the price of DTUs. This is explained by pooled resources being more likely to be used, meaning that the Azure platform must dedicate more underlying hardware to them.\nOne of the main advantages of working with Azure SQL Databases is the ability to scale-up and scale-down the resources available to serve users of the database, either in response to chronic performance issues or as activity grows or declines over time. If you need to allocate more resources, then, in theory, scaling up is simply a matter of dragging the DTU slider to the right to allocate more CPU and IO throughput or dragging the disk space slider to the right. Likewise, you can scale-down, as activity levels drop over time.\nIn practice, you don't want to spend your whole day doing this. It would be tricky to automate; there are limits governed by the database's performance tier, and it's not an immediate process. For larger databases, it can take a considerable amount of time to scale-up (the guideline is 1GB per minute), and during the allocation and deallocation periods, the database is disabled for a short period of time.\nWhy Use SQL Elastic Pools? Let's say you have two S4 Azure SQL Databases, meaning that each has access to a maximum of 200 DTUs. Would you want to put them together in a 200eDTU elastic pool, and would you want to allow either one of the databases to use all the pool's DTUs at any time? It depends. In most organizations, database activity does not spread evenly across all databases. Some are much busier than others. Similarly, few databases show even levels of activity throughout the day; the workloads are often \"spiky,\" with periods of high user activity levels and resource use interspersed with quieter periods.\nFigure 1 shows the two S4 Azure SQL Databases, each with spiky workloads, as reflected in the DTU loads for different periods.\nFigure 1: Running two Azure SQL databases separately\nFor both databases, there are significant periods where you'll be paying for resources you're not using unless you spend a lot of time scaling up and down by the hour, as required.\nElastic pools are compelling in this case because we have two databases that are loaded at different times and, together, the load spreads evenly across the day. For example, if you have two similarly-resourced databases, one of which is used primarily during business hours and the other is primarily used overnight, placing the two databases in an elastic pool allows you to run the overnight process using the resources you're already paying for to serve the daytime database.\nFigure 2: Running the two Azure SQL databases in a pool\nSimilarly, if you have several rarely-used databases, you might consider placing them in one elastic pool.\nWhile Figure 2 looks great in theory, in practice, there will inevitably be some overlap in the high-activity periods of the two databases. This means that the tricky thing about putting databases in elastic pools is being sure that competition for the pooled resources doesn't affect either database's performance. If you look at a pooled database in isolation, it may seem to be adequately-provisioned, running at say 50 percent CPU. However, this is 50 percent of the maximum possible CPU assuming no other load in the pool: activity on other databases in the pool might mean that there is no additional processing power available to that database. This is why it's so important to monitor utilization both for the databases and the elastic pool.\nMonitoring Elastic Pools in SQL Monitor If an Azure SQL Database is experiencing performance issues and it's hosted in an elastic pool, then you need to be able to review the use of DTUs both at the pool level, aggregated for databases it hosts, and for the individual databases. You'll want to be able to view individually each of the resources that comprise the DTU, which is CPU, data IO, and log IO so that you can see which one, if any, is the bottleneck and how use of that resource is distributed across the databases.\nSQL Monitor brings all this information together, recording and alerting on the utilization of both the pool and the databases contained in it, in the same place as all the monitoring data for your on-premise servers and with the same richness of detail.\nOverviews of Resource Usage SQL Monitor automatically detects any elastic pool on any monitored Azure SQL Server, and on the SQL Monitor dashboard, it has a special icon on the top-left of its card to indicate that it's a pool, as shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 3: An elastic pool as it appears on the SQL Monitor dashboard\nClicking on the card reveals the elastic pool overview, where you can see the pool's important performance metrics: the percentage of DTU being used and then, contributing to that overarching metric, the aggregate CPU, data IO, and log IO percentages for the pool.\nFigure 4: Elastic pool overview showing the DTU, CPU, Data IO, and Log IO metrics\nWe can see that from 10:20 PM onward, the pool was running at maximum DTU capacity, caused entirely, in this simulated example, by the fact that the maximum CPU allocation is in use. A little later, I'll describe in more detail how individual resource metrics contribute to the overall DTU measurement.\nThe pool will also have a limit on the number of concurrent worker thread requests it can support (for a 200 eDTU pool, it would be 400, which is also the individual limit for an S4 database). If you deplete the pool of available worker threads, all other sessions will be forced to wait until some become free, and performance will deteriorate badly.\nThere are also pool-wide limits on metrics that are related to availability rather than performance, such as space used and the number of concurrent sessions. The number of concurrent sessions for a pool is currently set at 30,000, but if you have a lot of databases in a pool and you reach it, all further connection requests will be refused.\nFigure 5: Elastic pool overview showing the worker threads and sessions and storage metrics\nFurther down, you'll see the list of databases in the pool (four, in this case, called cpu , data , io , and cpu2 ) and graphs showing their individual resource utilization.\nFigure 6: Overview of activity on each database in an elastic pool\nIn this case, the databases cpu and cpu2 and are each using about 50 percent CPU and the pool is at 100 percent CPU (and DTU) load for that period, as we saw in Figure 4. The percentages shown for each database are percentages of the maximum possible CPU, data IO, and log IO utilization, assuming no other activity in the pool.\nClicking on any of one of the databases takes you to a more detailed summary of the database and a link to the familiar, more-detailed overview page, showing the top queries running on the database, and more.\nFigure 7: Resource use and activity of individual databases in the elastic pool\nMetrics and Alerts All the elastic pool metrics are available in the Analysis tab of SQL Monitor, so you can plot them on a graph and compare them directly over different periods.\nFigure 8: SQL Monitor metrics for Azure SQL elastic pools\nAdditionally, there are all the alerts you'd expect to see for both elastic pools and individual Azure SQL Databases. These include DTU, CPU, data IO, and log IO over-utilization, which can tell you that there is contention for these resources; that the space limit is being approached; and, finally, that the number of concurrent worker threads and sessions is approaching the limit.\nThis ensures that if you exceed any of the defined metrics that are unique to Azure SQL Database, you'll be made aware. These are in addition to all the standard alerts, so no extra work is required to set them up. However, like the standard alerts, you may want to tune these to ensure maximum signal and minimal noise.\nFigure 9: SQL Monitor's Azure SQL Database and Elastic Pool alerts\nUsing SQL Monitor to Diagnose Resource Contention If you're investigating a performance issue with a database in an elastic pool, perhaps due to an alert being raised, the starting point should be the overview page for the elastic pool.\nIf you see a pool running at 100 percent capacity (no more available DTUs), drill down to look at each database to try to determine the root cause, whether it's unexpected activity in a single database or that the pool is under-provisioned. In the previous example, we saw a case where two databases using 50 percent CPU load meant that the pool was at 100 p CPU load. You would want to look in more detail at the activity on each of these databases: SQL Monitor's database overview page is ideal for this. It will give you the information you need to know if this is a sudden change or a chronic problem. If the former, you'll be able to investigate any scheduled tasks that were running (in which case you'd want to reconsider what it was doing and when), which CPU-intensive queries were running, any associated high wait times for certain wait types, any execution plan regressions, and more. Conversely, if CPU usage has simply been growing slowly over time, then allocating more DTUs to the elastic pool might be appropriate.\nAlternatively, if you have a performance issue and the resource graphs show that CPU, data IO, and log IO for the pool are not high, then the pool should have enough capacity to serve the databases. You'll still want to drill-down to look at the databases, though, to check if one of them is running at 100 percent DTU, which indicates that the database is using all its allocated DTUs from the pool. If this is the case, it might be worth investigating what proportion of the pool each database can use: this is in the \"per database settings\" section of the elastic pool \"configure\" panel in the Azure portal.\nFigure 10: Setting the DTU allocation for each database in a pool\nHow Does Database DTU Usage Combine to Form Elastic Pool eDTU Usage? Elastic pool eDTUs are, like DTUs, are referred to as a \"blended\" measure of activity, combining CPU usage with log IO and data IO. In common with most of the documentation around elastic pools, in the discussion above, we talk about database activity consuming the eDTUs available to an elastic pool. However, this isn't strictly accurate: elastic pools (at least in their current implementation) combine the resources for CPU, data IO, and log IO separately , just as a physical server does.\nThe formula for calculating eDTU usage in an elastic pool is the same as that for the calculating DTU usage in an individual database:\nDTU_percent = Max(cpu_percent, data_io_percent, log_io_percent)\nIt means that for an individual database, the DTU percentage is the maximum of any CPU, Log IO, and data IO percentages. So, if CPU=82 percent, Log I/O = 50 percent and Data IO = 53 percent, then DTU% = 82.\nConsider the analysis graph in Figure 11. At just before 09:30, I started a high CPU workload on database cpu , and 20 minutes later started a simulated high log IO workload in database io . The blue line shows DTUPercent for the pool, the red line CPUPercent on database cpu , and the purple and green lines show LogI/Opercent and CPUpercent for database io .\nFigure 11: Running different types of workload on pooled databases\nWhen we start the simulated log IO workload, it also generates a relatively small amount of CPU activity, which reduces the CPU available to the cpu database; this is the only performance impact.\nFor elastic pools, we should combine all the CPU across the pool, all the log IO, and all the data IO before taking the maximum to find the eDTU percentage. The way we combine the percentages, CPU for example, is to sum the CPU percentages for each database after scaling them according to any per-database DTU limit compared against the pool's DTU limit.\nThe effect of this is that if you want to squeeze every bit of performance from your elastic pool, you might also consider the distribution of the types of load across the pool: you can have high CPU activity on one database and high data IO activity on another, and these won't affect each other.\nWhat's up Next? The most likely next development around support for Azure SQL Database and Elastic Pools will be to support vCore pricing.

The two companies are working on what they are calling the Open Manufacturing Platform (OMP), which they said will create an open technology framework that will support the development of smart factory offerings, and want automotive companies and other manufacturers to sign up.\nSEE : Free PDF download: The Rise of Industrial IoT\nThe companies said that manufacturers can be hindered by proprietary systems that create data silos. Microsoft said the idea of OMP is to offer a reference architecture with open-source components based on open industrial standards and an open data model, although it will all be built on Microsoft's Azure industrial IoT cloud platform. The companies aim to have a set of four to six partners and a minimum of 15 use cases rolled out in production environments by the end of 2019.\n\"Utilizing industrial use cases and sample code, community members and other partners will have the capability to develop their own services and solutions while maintaining control over their data,\" the company said.\nBMW will provide examples such as its use of IoT in its autonomous transport systems at its plant in Regensburg, Germany, which has allowed the company to simplify logistics through central coordination of the transport system.\nMicrosoft said this and other use cases \u2014 such as digital feedback loops, digital supply-chain management and predictive maintenance \u2014 will be made available within the OMP community.\nThe OMP will be designed to address common industrial challenges, such as machine connectivity and on-premises systems integration. This could make it easier to reuse software solutions among OEMs, suppliers and other partners, reducing implementation costs. Microsoft said a robotics standard for autonomous transport systems for production and logistics will be contributed to the OMP for everyone to use.\nLast week the world's biggest carmaker Volkswagen said it will use cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to connect and manage its manufacturing plants and supply chain .\nMORE ON THE INDUSTRIAL

They supply the consoles that most players are using. But that's not deterring challengers like Amazon.com and Alphabet 's Google, which are hoping that their server-side muscle can help people enjoy top-tier video games without powerful consoles .\nMicrosoft and Sony both have video game streaming services of their own, but they'll see their hardware-based advantages erode if cloud streaming takes off. What can they do to stay a step ahead?\nMicrosoft seems to be working on an answer. Already a giant of nonconsole streaming thanks to its dominance in the PC market, Microsoft is reportedly working on ways to spread its Xbox platform far beyond its Xbox hardware.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nMore Xbox games may be coming to Windows Xbox has a strong user base, albeit one that is not as strong as that of Sony's PlayStation, according to sales figures. And there are even more people with Windows PCs, including those who play games on them. In fact, people play more hours of games on PCs than on either PlayStation 4 or Xbox One consoles, according to 2017 data from Nielsen . So it makes sense that Microsoft is taking steps that would allow it to put Xbox games on PCs.\nIn an interview last month with PC Gamer , Phil Spencer, executive vice president of gaming at Microsoft, said:\nDelivering great gaming experience to PC players is critically important to the future of Xbox and gaming at Microsoft. ... While we are proud of our PC gaming heritage, we've made some mistakes along our journey. We know we have to move forward, informed by our past, with the unique wants, needs and challenges of the PC player at the center of decisions we make.\nOne of the traditional problems with PC gaming is that PCs, unlike a given type of console, don't all have the same hardware specs, so games don't run the same on all PCs. But cloud gaming -- in which the video games stream from a distant server -- could change that, and Microsoft wants to be ready.\nAs part of its effort to embrace change, Microsoft is reportedly adding Xbox code to Windows . Among those who noticed the code in the latest Windows 10 build is Brad Sams, who wrote in a late February post on Thurrott.com that the code \"makes it easier for developers to build one game for both PC and Xbox which is a huge win for Microsoft on both the console and PC gaming fronts.\"\nXbox users can already use Microsoft's Play Anywhere program to track their progress and achievements across both PC and Xbox versions of certain games, but that's not quite the same thing as running Xbox games on a PC.\nAnd then there's xCloud, a cloud video game streaming platform that Microsoft talked about at this year's Game Developers Conference (GDC). Like Google's just-announced Stadia, xCloud will use cloud servers to run its games -- no console required. But the connection to the Xbox platform is also clear, as Microsoft is using its existing Xbox library as a starting point for xCloud (and, of course, is using that \"X\" in the brand name).\nGoing beyond the box Microsoft's moves show that it is thinking about what Xbox will be after it's no longer just a physical box.\nBringing the PC and the console gaming experience together could be the move that Microsoft needs in order to fend off Amazon and Google and adapt to win in a streaming future. Microsoft also has a game studio dedicated to creating console exclusives, and that studios could easily generate exclusives for a multiplatform streaming service instead.\nWith an inside track and a foothold in two separate gaming worlds, Microsoft shouldn't have to worry much about the changes.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.pcgamer.com/phil-spencer-talks-microsofts-new-studios-and-its-commitment-to-pc-gaming-in-2019/", "https://www.thurrott.com/xbox/200140/microsofts-evolving-gaming-strategy-takes-a-giant-step-forwardhttps://www.thurrott.com/xbox/200140/microsofts-evolving-gaming-strategy-takes-a-giant-step-forward"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "sony", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nintendo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "getty images", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon.com", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T19:40:24.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "626d8eef8ded21f59f10648371d3e5dcb3c16472", "url": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/3386378/microsoft-has-closed-its-e-bookstore-and-everything-you-purchased-will-vanish-in-july.html", "site_full": "www.pcworld.com", "site": "pcworld.com", "site_section": "http://www.pcworld.com/index.rss", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "PCWorld", "title": "Microsoft has closed its e-bookstore, and everything you purchased will vanish in July", "title_full": "Microsoft has closed its e-bookstore, and everything you purchased will vanish in July", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1328, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 54, "comments": 19, "shares": 50}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "626d8eef8ded21f59f10648371d3e5dcb3c16472", "url": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/3386378/microsoft-has-closed-its-e-bookstore-and-everything-you-purchased-will-vanish-in-july.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "pcworld.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Microsoft has closed its e-bookstore, and everything you purchased will vanish in July", "text": "Microsoft has closed its e-bookstore, and everything you purchased will vanish in July Microsoft will offer refunds, plus a bonus if you've marked up an ebook. Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry Mechanical keyboards: Everything you need to know\nMicrosoft has shuttered its ebook bookstore, yet another move by the company away from selling traditional consumer goods and services, with the exception of its Xbox console.\nMicrosoft made its decision without fanfare on Tuesday, simply posting a notice in the corner of the Microsoft Store app and removing the \u201cBooks\u201d tab. Microsoft\u2019s notice now leads to a support page and FAQ where Microsoft posted the answers to the questions consumers want to know: namely, what will happen to my books?\nThe answer, simply put, is that they\u2019ll disappear entirely sometime around July 2019, and you\u2019ll be given a full refund. If you ordered or rented an ebook before today, your order will be cancelled and refunded. Free ebooks downloaded via the Microsoft Store app will also disappear, and they won\u2019t be available after July, either. [ Further reading: The best surge protectors for your costly electronics ]\nMicrosoft didn\u2019t say why it was discontinuing its ebookstore, though lack of demand was probably a factor. Microsoft promoted its Books tab simply through the Store app, without any overt marketing of its contents or any deals within\u2014unfortunately, a somewhat typical Microsoft failing. The ebookstore also had two likely-fatal flaws: ebooks purchased within the Books tab weren\u2019t downloadable, and they were readable only within the Microsoft Edge browser, which has a meager 4.4-percent share of the browser market.\nMicrosoft\u2019s ebooks experience began bumpily , without the bookmarks and annotations you\u2019d expect. Unfortunately, even though those capabilities arrived later\u2014along with some nifty PDF capabilities \u2014it\u2019s possible that customers had moved on. After all, Microsoft\u2019s ebook competitor was Amazon, whose mammoth online bookstore already boasted tons of titles that could be downloaded and read within Amazon\u2019s full-featured Kindle app.\nIf you did buy into Microsoft\u2019s Edge ebook experience, complete with annotations, there is a small bonus: Microsoft will pay you an additional $25, credited to your Microsoft account. (That won\u2019t save your annotations, though, as they\u2019ll disappear with the rest of your files.)\nMicrosoft didn\u2019t say exactly when in July the ebooks would disappear, implying that it will occur on an individual basis. \u201cYour books will be removed from Microsoft Edge when Microsoft processes the refunds,\u201d Microsoft said.\nWhat this means for you: For anyone who\u2019s watched Microsoft continue to turn away from the consumer market, most recently killing its Groove music service in 2017 , the shuttering of its meager ebook service isn\u2019t surprising\u2014but it is disappointing. At least Microsoft\u2019s Movies & TV tab within the Microsoft Store app appears to be alive and well, with lists of frequently rented movies and TV shows, and, more importantly, sales and discounts.

This week's list includes Nike NKE , FedEx FDX , Adobe ADBE and JPMorgan JPM .\nEarnings Recession Fears Are Exaggerated\nWith earnings growth expectations for the first quarter of 2019 already in negative territory and estimates for 2019 Q2 moving in that direction as well, there is growing talk of an impending earnings recession.\nThis is coming at a time when many in the market are worried about the duration of the current economic cycle that is on track to become the longest in the nation's history later this summer. It is this backdrop that has made market participants overly sensitive to the shape of the Treasury yield curve and its cyclical implications. No doubt, the 'R' word has become potent.\nSo how reasonable are these 'earnings recession' fears?\nThe definition of 'recession' is two or more quarters of negative growth, typically GDP growth. The chart below of quarterly year-over-year earnings growth for the S&P 500 index shows estimates for the current and following three quarters and actual results for the preceding 5 quarters.\nTo be totally pedantic about it, the recession talk reflects ground reality, as you can see in the chart above. After all, earnings growth in the first two quarters of the year is on track to be negative, even though the 2019 Q2 growth pace is barely in negative territory.\nWe shouldn't take this recession talk too seriously, however. The reason is that the negative growth in the first half of the year is solely because of very tough comparisons. In other words, the base period for 2019 Q1 growth is 2018 Q1, when earnings received a huge boost from the tax-cut legislation. You can see this in the expanded version of the above chart that shows all four quarters of 2017 as well.\nThe lower corporate tax rates that showed up in earnings for the first time in 2018 Q1, the base year for 2019 Q1, boosted profitability through margin expansion. As such, we are up against some tough comparisons in 2019.\nThe tax cut legislation didn't have a direct bearing on revenues last year and we are not seeing that much drop off in estimates for this year either, as the chart below shows (orange bars).\nSo, if the earnings recession is only 'technical,' is there nothing to worry about on the earnings front?\nThat's not correct as there are legitimate reasons to be wary of the earnings picture. The earnings growth trajectory would be challenged and difficult even without the issue of the aforementioned tough comparisons as the global economic growth backdrop has become less favorable and cyclical rises in transportation, logistics, payroll and other expenses are squeezing margins. As a result, analysts steadily lowered their estimates for 2019 Q1 as well as full-year 2019.\nThe weak guidance from Nike, FedEx, Adobe and others in this reporting cycle suggests that we will likely see a replay of what we experienced the las t earnings season that pushed estimates lower. We will be keeping a close eye on how estimates for 2018 Q2 evolve as companies report Q1 results and share their outlook for Q2 and beyond.\nExpectations for 2019 Q1 & the Initial Earnings Report\nTotal earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be down -3.8% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues. If actual 2019 Q1 earnings growth turns out to be negative, it will be the first earnings decline since the second quarter of 2016.\nDriving the expected Q1 earnings decline is broad-based margin pressures across all major sectors, with net margins for the index of 11% down from 12% in the year-earlier and 11.8% in the preceding quarter. The Utilities sector is the only one that is expected to have unchanged net margins in 2019 Q1 relative to the year-earlier period, with margins expected to be lower for all of the remaining 15 sectors.\nQ1 earnings growth is expected to be negative for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with double-digit earnings declines for 5 sectors, including Energy and Technology. For the Technology sector, Q1 earnings are expected to be down -10% from the same period last year on +3% higher revenues and 270 basis points compression in net margins.\nFor the Finance sector whose members will be in the first round of Q1 releases, total earnings are expected to be up only +0.8% on +6.5% higher revenues.\nThe market will start paying attention to the start of the earnings season following the quarterly reports from JPMorgan and others on April 12th. But these bank earnings reports will not be the first of the Q1 earnings season, as the reporting cycle has actually gotten underway already, with results from 20 S&P 500 members out. All of these early reports, which includes a few bellwethers like FedEx, Nike and others, have fiscal quarters ending in February, which we count as part of our March-quarter tally.\nFor the 20 S&P 500 members that have reported Q1 results already, total earnings are down -11% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, with 75% beating EPS estimates and 50% beating revenue estimates.\nThe Q1 growth for these 20 index is tracking notably below what we had seen in the recent past and positive revenue surprises appear also to be on the weak side, as the comparison charts below show.\nIt is premature to draw any firm conclusions from this admittedly small sample of Q1 results, but it is nevertheless a weak start to the reporting season.\nFor an in-depth look at the overall earnings picture and expectations for Q1, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Margin Pressures Weigh on Earnings Growth\nBreakout Biotech Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit Potential\nThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond $775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases.

The Microsoft Store is mainly alluring for its apps these days, and dropping books would reflect that priority.\nThere's also a technical reality that may have prompted the change.

Instead of having to understand the layers of training that go into the ResNet50 deep learning neural network, or how to build learning platforms using TensorFlow or Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) , these services are just APIs that are ready to use. Microsoft has already trained the neural nets for these services, and it continues to tune them and use real-world operations as a foundation for future improvements. They\u2019re cheap to use compared to the compute and storage cost of building and running your own machine learning algorithms.\nThe machine learning tools on Azure have rapidly become an important resource for anyone wanting to add basic artificial intelligence to an app. It\u2019s important to know that they are limited, with a focus on three key areas: computer vision, text analysis, and speech recognition. They\u2019re all important areas, but they are a limited subset of what can be done with modern machine learning. Azure Cognitive Services enters a new AI area\nFortunately, the first new cognitive service to explore other aspects of machine learning entered beta recently: adding anomaly detection to the roster . Anomaly detection is an important AI tool, analyzing time-series data for items that are outside normal operating characteristics for the data source. That makes it an extremely flexible tool because modern businesses have a lot of streamed data, from financial transactions to software logs to device telemetry. The ability to use one API to work across all these different feeds shouldn\u2019t be underestimated, because it makes building appropriate software a lot easier.\nNormally anomaly detection takes time to set up. You need to train your model against a large amount of data to determine what\u2019s normal operation and what\u2019s out of the ordinary. It\u2019s how credit-card fraud-detection systems build a model of your spending (and of all their customers\u2019 habits) to detect when a compromised card is used and to block any future transactions to keep losses to a minimum.

Microsoft was formerly the frontrunner, having surpassed Apple in November .\nMicrosoft closed Tuesday at $914.45 billion in market capitalization.\nThe reason for Apple's resurgence in the short-term isn't clear, given analyst reaction to the \"its show time\" Apple News event, but analysts and investors appear to be regaining confidence in the wake of a disastrous December quarter which saw iPhone sales tumble 15 percent year-over-year . The company saw its worst performance in China, battered by a combination of lower-cost local phone brands, a weak economy, and its decision to once again hike entry-level iPhone prices, exacerbated by exchange rates.\nIt has since adopted more aggressive sales tactics to compensate, cutting prices in some countries and extending extra trade-in credit.\nSome analysts are pinning their hopes on Apple's growing services business, which includes divisions like Apple Music, the App Store, and its upcoming Apple TV+ video service , coupled with the now-available Apple News+ .\nWhile the services themselves may add a modest boost to profits, the real benefit is expected to be keeping people locked into the Apple ecosystem.
