Credit: AAP\nMagistrate Costas Killias on Tuesday dismissed charges of animal cruelty and reckless endangerment against Mr Lu, finding the university computer sciences student threw the cat over the balcony but had no criminal case to answer.\n\"This was a terrible accident which led to the death of an innocent and apparently, on all accounts, playful pet. But it was not deliberate,\" he said.\nAdvertisement Loading The magistrate, who compared the event to a driver accidentally hitting a dog, versus one who actively ran one down out of a dislike of dogs.\n\"I have every sympathy for the poor cat that found itself in this situation, but I have to satisfy myself ... whether it was intentional or not,\" Mr Killias said.\nThere was no intended cruelty, he found.\nMr Lu told the court he only meant to throw Chau Chau onto the balcony after the kitten scratched his leg from under a couch in April 2018.\n\"I grabbed the cat and put the cat outside but I might have used a bit too much force,' Lu said, with the aid of a Chinese interpreter.\n\"I only intended to put the cat on to the balcony, not over the balcony.\"\nThe court was previously told Mr Lu launched Chau Chau using a rugby pass-like motion.\nKaiqi Chen, Chau Chau's owner and Mr Lu's then girlfriend \u2013 they've since broken up \u2013 watched from the bathroom as her beloved pet sailed \"in the air\" over the balustrade.\nShe raced outside to where Chau Chau's body lay in the street.\nThe cat had landed just steps from passersby on Elizabeth Street.\n\"Lu Cheng kept saying 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry' on the phone,\" Ms Chen said.\nSenior Constable Tom Roberts had argued the physics of Chau Chau's trajectory, flying 2\u00bd metres through the air from inside the apartment to over the balcony, didn't add up to an accident.\n\"The cat went so far the only inference that can be drawn was the intention was to put the cat over the balcony,\" he said.\nThe magistrate rejected that argument and said multiple inferences could be drawn, underpinning his reasonable doubt.\nMr Kilias, who was appointed to the bench last year after a long career as a barrister and actor, is perhaps best known for playing Farouk, Darryl Kerrigan\u2019s Lebanese neighbour, in the 1997 film The Castle.\nAAP", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

Max Software Fixes Embed Embed\nLast week, Boeing said software fixes for its troubled 737 Max airplanes were finished and ready to go. But now the company says more time is needed to make sure the fixes are done right.\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\nBoeing wants more time. The company has been working on software fixes for a flight control system on the 737 MAX airplanes. Two of those planes crashed in recent months, one in Indonesia last October, another in Ethiopia last month, killing a total of 346 people. Investigators say the flight control system may have been a factor in both crashes. Boeing had said the problem with the planes was solved. Now the company has reversed course. NPR's David Schaper reports.\nDAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: In an effort to improve the safety of its troubled 737 MAX and rebuild trust in the Boeing name, company officials unveiled fixes to the plane's MCAS flight control system to pilots, industry officials, regulators and reporters from around the world in suburban Seattle last week. They showed how they'd be giving pilots more control over the automated system, how they'd be adding redundancies and would be making warning lights alerting pilots to a problem standard. And Boeing detailed improved pilot training on how to deal with an unexpected activation of the system.\nOfficials at the aircraft manufacturer then said that those fixes would be submitted to the FAA for regulatory review before the end of last week, but that didn't happen. And now both Boeing and the FAA say a few more weeks are needed before the software fixes will be ready.\nED COLEMAN: What may have happened is as they were doing the testing last week or the rollout with some of the customers and pilots, they may have noticed something that they didn't expect. So they're going to go back in and take a look at it again.\nSCHAPER: Ed Coleman is director of the aviation safety institute at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz.\nCOLEMAN: Just changing one line of code can have different effects throughout multiple systems on the airplane. So they need to take their time and make sure they're doing it right.\nSCHAPER: In a statement, Boeing says the company is taking a thorough and methodical approach to the development and testing of the software update to ensure that they get it right. The FAA says it will subject the changes to a rigorous safety review and will not approve Boeing's fixes until regulators are satisfied.

It has failed to fix its perennial engine problem and has been grounded until its software enhancement is complete. The Lion Air Crash that took place on October 29 claiming 189 lives also led to the death of a 31-year-old Indian pilot named Bhavye Suneja . His wife Garima Sethi in a detailed interview to the Washington Post said that Boeing was \u201cplaying with the lives of its passengers.\u201d\nSethi informed that three months after the deadly attack she sat with the senior officials of Indonesian carrier and asked them to stop operating the Boeing 737 MAX jet. However, her request was not paid attention to as the officials said that they needed more information on the tragedy to take such a step.\nPhoto: 31-year-old Indian pilot of the Indonesian carrier, Bhavye Suneja\nNow, she believes a second crash of a Boeing Max jet, in Ethiopia this month, could have been prevented if the appeals by the victims' families were given more weight by Lion Air and others. Don't Miss Drug Inspector Shot Dead In Punjab Allegedly For Cancelling Medical Shop's Licence 10 Years Ago 7.4 K SHARES\n31-year-old Sethi said that they tried to do their part but nobody heard them. Boeing repeatedly assured the world that their 737 MAX jets were safe until the recent Ethiopian airline crash.\nSethi was out with a friend in Delhi on March 10 when she heard that an Ethiopian Airlines jet had crashed. She immediately rushed home to find out more.\n\"It was altogether the same story,\" she said. \"I don't have any words.\" she informed the international publication. She further reiterated that she was looking at some type of justice and whoever was at fault should claim responsibility for their mistakes. Sethi described his husband as somebody who was a \u201cpassionate flier and a good human being.\u201d In the first week of March, it was reported that the Federal Aviation Administration of the United States had discovered stark similarities between the Ethiopian aircraft crash and the Lion air crash in Indonesia. The discovery had led the agency to ground all Boeing 737 MAX 8 and 9 planes for weeks.\nIn an emergency order, the US lawmakers said that both the disasters posed a probability of a shared cause that needs to be better understood and addressed. The planes will remain grounded until a software upgrade can be tested and installed. Boeing again ran into trouble in its home turf itself after a 737 Max made an emergency landing in Orlando, Florida, after experiencing an engine problem on March 26. The flight operated by Southwest Airlines was being flown to storage when it developed an engine problem, immediately after takeoff, forcing the crew to declared an emergency and landed safely in Orlando.

It was released in 1977 and in 2009, VH1 named it the 32nd best rock song of all time. But, we digress. No matter how much you love your cat(s), if they are tearing up your furniture, it\u2019s time to find a solution. We\u2019re here to help.\nDo all cats scratch furniture? Scratching is a normal aspect of cat behavior. In the wild, cats scratch their claws to remove the dead layer of claw (think of it like a cat manicure), which helps to keep their claws sharp for hunting. Scratching also lets them mark their territory. They have scent glands between their claws and the scratch marks themselves are a visual sign to other cats that this area is occupied. Scratching and stretching also help them to keep their bodies in good shape.\nSo, your much-loved cat is simply being a cat. However, it\u2019s not fun if they decide to leave their calling card on your furniture, drapes or carpets. So here are some proven ways to keep a cat from scratching furniture.\nDon\u2019t declaw your cat Declawing your cat is not recommended. It\u2019s a surgical procedure that involves removing the last bone in each of your cat\u2019s toes to prevent the claws from regrowing . It can lead to behavior problems such as biting and refusal to use a litter box. Scratching isn\u2019t the only unusual behavior cats sometimes display\u2014find out why cats knead .\nProvide scratching posts Kittens begin to scratch at around eight weeks old, so start training your cat when it\u2019s young by providing scratching posts or stands. Your cat can still indulge in its natural behavior, but without shredding your furniture. And, here\u2019s more awesome DIY cat furniture to entertain your cat.\nUse cat scratch spray Using a cat scratch spray will trick your cat into thinking that it has already marked its territory, discouraging it from scratching where you don\u2019t want it to. You can purchase a spray to stop cats from scratching furniture , but it\u2019s easy to make your own homemade cat scratching spray using vinegar, essential citrus oils, or even garlic and peppermint! And if you\u2019re trying to keep your cat off your kitchen countertop, here are 10 ways to do it.\nUse cat scratch tape If you\u2019re wondering how to stop cats from scratching leather furniture, then cat scratch tape is the answer. It also works well on fabric, carpet and hard surfaces such as walls and doors. This double-sided sticky tape comes in panels or rolls like regular tape, and can be stuck where you need it and removed easily afterward. Cats hate the feeling of stickiness on their paws, so it discourages scratching. Find out more about signs your cat is mad at you .\nTry socks or nail caps Cat socks (aka mittens) to prevent scratching are an alternative to declawing. These socks work well for some cats, but if yours gets frustrated and keeps removing them, try soft nail caps that glue onto your cat\u2019s claws. These will limit the damage if your cat does decide to scratch where it shouldn\u2019t.\nProtect with vinyl guards Yet another option is to install clear vinyl panels on your furniture where your cat wants to scratch.

There are not many of the small spotted cats living in zoos either, which could spell trouble for the entire species. Pressures from human development and pollution are driving wild fishing cat numbers down further, which means that a healthy population of fishing cats living in zoos is more important than ever. Unfortunately, breeding fishing cats in zoos has proven just as difficult as studying and protecting them in the wild. But a new study might change that.\nThe study by Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute scientists and researchers from George Mason University published in Zoo Biology identified several things zoos can do to encourage fishing cats to breed and prevent their numbers from dwindling. To gather the best data, the team monitored fishing cats living in zoos in North America for three years as they were moved to new homes in different zoos and then introduced to potential mates. All of the animals were moved at the recommendation of the Species Survival Plan (SSP).\nWhen the SSP recommends two fishing cats to breed, the first step is moving the cats to the same zoo. More than half of the time zoos elected to move a male who had been given a breeding recommendation rather than a female. This mimics what happens in the wild. Females typically have a set territory, whereas males wonder around looking for females to mate with.\nThe timing of the transfers also mimicked seasonal breeding cycles. Sixty-two percent of the transfers occurred during autumn.\nAfter a male cat moves, researchers found that it was important to give him time to adjust to his new home before introducing him to his potential mate\u2014on average about three months.\nBased on these findings, the scientists proposed that fishing cats should move in late spring or early summer. That would allow ample time for the cat to adjust to his or her new environment before being introduced, and still allow for introductions when the female is most receptive.\nIn addition to allowing more time for adjustment, the scientists found that zoos that incorporated formal training sessions at least 10 days a month were more successful at breeding fishing cats. Training is one way to develop a positive animal keeper relationship, which can improve overall welfare by giving the animal more control over their care. Animals who had the choice to spend time on exhibit or in off-exhibit enclosures were more likely to breed successfully. Most cats are secretive, and a private area may help them to feel more comfortable during a vulnerable time when they are meeting a new mate.\nAnother indicator of success was friendly vocalizations between the fishing cats. For many animals, communication is key to a successful pairing. Cats can communicate information about their reproductive status with both vocalizations and scent markings. Scientists also noted that fishing cats have rigid pairing. Breeding pairs should be given approximately one-year as a trial period, and if the pair has not expressed appropriate breeding behaviors a new match should be made.\nThe final puzzle piece to increasing the population will be the role of zoos. They will have to collaborate and prioritize the species to create a self-sustaining population that will serve as an insurance population for the wild.\nWith this in mind, the scientists recommended that breeding pairs of fishing cats should move to zoos that can house multiple pairs. This way, the mates can be easily switched around to determine compatibility.\nFishing cats both help to control pests and indicate healthy water systems in their natural habitat. Since their presence is an important indicator of how an ecosystem is faring, the more zoos can learn about the intricacies of breeding them, the easier it will be to build a healthy population.\nLead researcher Jilian Fazio said that though this study was a great starting point, more research is needed to uncover the many mysteries of the rare and fascinating fishing cat.

Deren&apos;s cat Kaiya is on the chair in the foreground. By Billy Baker Globe Staff April 02, 2019 HAVERHILL \u2014 Susan Deren sat at her kitchen table, carefully propped a cordless phone in front of her and a notepad to her side, and opened up her iPhone to look at a photo of a small dog, a pug in a pink harness named Luna.\nThen Deren, who calls herself an \u201canimal communicator,\u201d picked up the cordless phone and dialed Luna\u2019s owner so she could begin communicating with the dog. Over the phone. Mind-to-mind. The only thing she knew about the dog was her name and what she saw in the photo.\nAfter exchanging a few pleasantries with Luna\u2019s owner and making clear that she is not a veterinarian, Deren closed her eyes and began to \u201cget inside\u201d the dog\u2019s body and mind, as she describes it.\nAdvertisement \u201cIs she about 14?\u201d she asked, writing the number 14 on her notepad.\nGet Metro Headlines in your inbox: The 10 top local news stories from metro Boston and around New England delivered daily. \u201cShe\u2019s 9,\u201d the owner replied. \u201cShe\u2019ll be 10 this year.\u201d\n\u201cShe feels older.\u201d\nDeren, who is 65, continued her process of moving through the dog\u2019s body, her eyes closed as if in a trance.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like she has something seriously wrong with her lungs or anything like that,\u201d Deren said, before the owner interrupted.\nAdvertisement \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should tell you this or not, but she had breathing surgery three years ago.\u201d\nDeren is one of at least 10 animal communicators working in Massachusetts, in an unregulated field of practitioners who describe themselves as \u201cempaths\u201d or \u201ctelepaths\u201d and claim a paranormal ability to know what an animal is thinking and feeling. Deren, who left a career in insurance 27 years ago, does five to six calls a day and says the animals speak to her in full sentences, in English.\nJim Davis /Globe Staff Susan Deren, a pet communicator, in her kitchen talking on speaker phone with a client named Dawn regarding her dog Luna. Practitioners qualify their work as \u201centertainment,\u201d similar to human psychics and tarot card readers. But with an animal involved \u2014 and they work with all of them, from cats to birds to the raccoon living under the porch \u2014 some veterinarians worry the practice can lead owners to make decisions that are not supported by medical science.\nBetsy Lordan, an Ipswich veterinarian who specializes in large animals, said owners who work with animal communicators can often request expensive diagnostics looking for a problem that is not there.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m working with an owner who has spoken with an animal communicator, I\u2019m happy to evaluate whatever they\u2019re concerned with,\u201d Lordan said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not going to substitute appropriate care based on what I\u2019m seeing.\u201d\nAdvertisement It is a sensitive area in the realm of animal care. Many who reach out to communicators are looking for answers that a veterinarian cannot provide, such as the right time to let go of a sick or elderly animal. Or they are seeking a back story for a rescue animal that would explain behavioral issues, which has the potential to feed an \u201cabuse\u201d narrative, according to Lordan, who said that more often the animal has been neglected and improperly socialized and trained before adoption.\nThe Globe contacted several professional veterinary organizations and encountered a reluctance to go on the record about the issue. Rob Halpin, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, would say only that \u201cthe MSPCA believes in science-based methods for diagnosing and treating our pet family members.\u201d\nDeren said that skepticism is part of the gig and she encounters it regularly, particularly from \u201coverly rational types\u201d and \u201chusbands.\u201d\nJim Davis /Globe Staff Susan Deren, a pet communicator, is pictured holding her cellphone in her kitchen with a photo of a dog named Luna. Dawn Allen, an animal communicator in Westfield who said she has worked with more than 7,000 clients over the phone during her 20-year career, said skepticism is necessary and healthy.\n\u201dIt is 100 percent not a fact-based business,\u201d Allen said, \u201cand there\u2019s certainly a suspension of belief because at some point you just have to believe in telepathy to talk about it. So I tell skeptics that there are so many people out there in this world that can help you in so many ways, so if you don\u2019t believe in animal communication, go to a vet or an animal behaviorist or hire a trainer.\u201d\nAllen, who is 44, became interested in the field after reading an article about it while a student at Bates College and then studied under several practitioners. She charges $95 for a 20- to 40-minute session, $105 if it\u2019s urgent. Deren, who says she has been able to speak to animals since she was a small child \u2014 \u201cMy mother thought I was crazy,\u201d she says \u2014 charges clients $75 for a 20-minute call.\nBack in her Haverhill kitchen, Deren is finishing up her 30-minute communication with the pug. Deren has discussed medications, recommending some and cautioning against others, and made diet recommendations. She has also, very dramatically, winced in pain \u2014 \u201clike I was being stabbed in my lower back\u201d \u2014 and advised the owner not to let the dog jump or climb stairs, and instead to carry or lift her. \u201cShe likes when you carry her,\u201d Deren told the woman.\n\u201cI\u2019m just so desperate,\u201d said the dog\u2019s owner, who had agreed to let the Globe listen to her reading. She then went into detail about how she has spent so much money on vets and acupuncturists to make her dog \u2014 who has been having daily seizures \u2014 feel more comfortable. \u201cThis has been very helpful for me. Things I suspected and things I thought about, but having you tell me that and confirm my thoughts is a nice thing, and makes me feel better.\u201d\nAfter Deren hung up, she began to cry.\n\u201cThat dog\u2019s not going to be here long,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad. She\u2019s just out of it. There\u2019s very little going back and forth with me because of all those seizures. It\u2019s like talking to someone who has dementia.\u201d\nThe owner seemed to be dancing around, but never directly asked, the ultimate question: Is it time to say goodbye?\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t ask,\u201d Deren said, and began to cry some more. \u201cThey usually ask. They usually ask.\u201d\nAfter several emotional moments, Deren began to dry her eyes and attempted to compose herself. Then she let out an embarrassed laugh.\n\u201cNow I\u2019ve got to get on the phone with a horse that\u2019s been throwing his owner, so that\u2019s going to be a ball.\u201d\nBilly Baker can be reached at billybaker@globe.com .

Boeing Co. says it needs more time to finish a software upgrade for its grounded 737 Max jetliners as company engineers update a stall-prevention system linked to two fatal crashes in five months.\nThe planemaker said last week it would submit final paperwork for the revamp to the Federal Aviation Administration by March 29 to make the system -- known as MCAS -- less aggressive in pushing down a plane\u2019s nose, and to add redundancy so that it\u2019s less likely to activate when other systems malfunction. Now Boeing says the update won\u2019t be ready until the \u201ccoming weeks.\u201d\nAn issue with integrating the software fix and the plane\u2019s existing flight-control architecture came to light as Boeing did a final audit of the upgrade, according to a person briefed on the work. Ensuring that MCAS will perform as desired while not interfering with existing flight controls isn\u2019t expected to be a significant challenge said the person, who wasn\u2019t authorized to speak about the work and asked not to be identified.\n\u201cWe are working to demonstrate that we have identified and appropriately addressed all certification requirements and will be submitting for FAA review once completed in the coming weeks,\u201d Boeing said in an email Monday. \u201cSafety is our first priority, and we will take a thorough and methodical approach to the development and testing of the update to ensure we take the time to get it right.\u201d\nThe FAA first announced that the proposed software upgrade wouldn\u2019t be ready for weeks, and said the changes would face a rigorous review. That bodes poorly for investors banking on Boeing quickly getting its single-aisle workhorse back in the air.\n\u201cThe FAA expects to receive Boeing\u2019s final package of its software enhancement over the coming weeks for FAA approval,\u201d the agency said. \u201cTime is needed for additional work by Boeing as the result of an ongoing review of the 737 Max Flight Control System to ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues.\u201d\n\u2018Rigorous\u2019 Review The FAA said it would \u201cnot approve the software for installation until the FAA is satisfied with the submission.\u201d Boeing will also have to convince skeptical regulators in Canada, Europe, China and elsewhere of the system\u2019s safety.\nBoeing shares were little changed at $390.87 in pre-market trading in New York on Tuesday. The planemaker\u2019s stock has fallen 7.3 percent since the Ethiopian Airlines crash, the worst performance on the 30-member Dow Jones Industrial Average.\nOn Monday evening, the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure said it had sent letters to both Boeing and the FAA asking for records \u201crelated to the certification of the Boeing 737 Max Aircraft.\u201d\n\u201cUnderstanding where things went wrong is critically important because tragedies like this should not happen,\u201d the committee chairman, Pete DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat, said in a statement.\nThe 737 Max models were grounded on March 13 after similarities began to emerge between the crash on March 10 in Ethiopia and the one on Oct. 29 off the coast of Indonesia. The disasters killed a combined 346 people.\nPush Down In the first crash, the computerized safety system known as MCAS -- for Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System -- repeatedly attempted to push down the nose of a Lion Air jet as the result of a faulty sensor. In the second, MCAS was also activated on an Ethiopian Airlines plane, according to reports last week in Bloomberg News and the Wall Street Journal.\nBoeing described the software patch, and the months of testing, in a briefing with reporters March 27 and a separate event the same day with pilots and industry officials. Submitting the final paperwork to the FAA would be the last step in a certification plan the company outlined for the agency on Jan. 21.\nThe manufacturer said it had also conducted \u201cthorough audits of all aspects of systems on the 737 Max with a particular focus on things that have changed\u201d from the previous generation of the jets.\nThe study involved poring over hazard analyses, fault trees and other engineering studies of the Max, and that aside from MCAS, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing else we\u2019ve found at this point.\u201d Boeing said.\nThe U.S. planemaker, working with regulators, has already spent months refining the software, using feedback from computer simulations and flight-tests, after its initial approach proved more complicated than originally expected.\n--With assistance from Mary Schlangenstein.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.bloomberg.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "julie", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alan levin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "johnsson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "boeing", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "federal aviation administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southwest airlines boeing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boeing co.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "southern california logistics airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victorville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T17:16:46.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "53e056c9c9cc1a37c7043a183162caf32746095b", "url": "https://windsor.ctvnews.ca/air-canada-revises-schedule-for-may-as-boeing-737-max-remains-grounded-1.4361920", "site_full": "windsor.ctvnews.ca", "site": "ctvnews.ca", "site_section": "http://windsor.ctvnews.ca/rss/ctv-news-windsor-1.1073359", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CTV News - Windsor", "title": "Air Canada revises schedule for May as Boeing 737 Max remains grounded", "title_full": "Air Canada revises schedule for May as Boeing 737 Max remains grounded | CTV News Windsor", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4333330.1552427630!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4971, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 19}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "53e056c9c9cc1a37c7043a183162caf32746095b", "url": "https://windsor.ctvnews.ca/air-canada-revises-schedule-for-may-as-boeing-737-max-remains-grounded-1.4361920", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The Canadian Press", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Air Canada revises schedule for May as Boeing 737 Max remains grounded", "text": "MONTREAL -- Air Canada has revised its schedule through to the end of May due to the continued grounding of its Boeing 737 Max aircraft.\nThe airline says it expects to cover 98 per cent of previously planned flying for the month through a several measures, including schedule changes and temporary route suspensions.\nTransport Canada grounded the Boeing 737 Max aircraft last month as part of an international response to the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines plane on March 10.\nAir Canada has removed its 24 Boeing 737 Max aircraft from service until at least July 1 for planning purposes.\nIt previously said 98 per cent of the April schedule is covered and now says it's working to update its June schedule.\nThe airline has been substituting different aircraft on 737 Max routes and extended leases for aircraft that were scheduled to exit the fleet.

Animal protection officers assisted RCMP at the scene.\nThe SPCA says the dogs were wrapped in tarps while the cats were in garbage bags.\nThe animals all appeared to be in poor condition and the dogs had very overgrown toenails.\nThere were no collars, tags, or microchips on the animals.\nThe SPCA says autopsies will be conducted to determine a cause of death. The organization confirms foul play is suspected.\nOne Great Dane is described as an older male. He is black with a white spot on his chest. Another dog is described as a black female with a grey face. She is missing half her tail. The third Great Dane is also female, fawn in colour, with a large tumour on her left side.\nOne cat is black and white in colour and medium-haired.

Deren&apos;s cat Kaiya is on the chair in the foreground. By Billy Baker Globe Staff April 02, 2019 HAVERHILL \u2014 Susan Deren sat at her kitchen table, carefully propped a cordless phone in front of her and a notepad to her side, and opened up her iPhone to look at a photo of a small dog, a pug in a pink harness named Luna.\nThen Deren, who calls herself an \u201canimal communicator,\u201d picked up the cordless phone and dialed Luna\u2019s owner so she could begin communicating with the dog. Over the phone. Mind-to-mind. The only thing she knew about the dog was her name and what she saw in the photo.\nAfter exchanging a few pleasantries with Luna\u2019s owner and making clear that she is not a veterinarian, Deren closed her eyes and began to \u201cget inside\u201d the dog\u2019s body and mind, as she describes it.\nAdvertisement \u201cIs she about 14?\u201d she asked, writing the number 14 on her notepad.\nGet Metro Headlines in your inbox: The 10 top local news stories from metro Boston and around New England delivered daily.

Deren, who left a career in insurance 27 years ago, does five to six calls a day and says the animals speak to her in full sentences, in English.\nJim Davis /Globe Staff Susan Deren, a pet communicator, in her kitchen talking on speaker phone with a client named Dawn regarding her dog Luna. Practitioners qualify their work as \u201centertainment,\u201d similar to human psychics and tarot card readers. But with an animal involved \u2014 and they work with all of them, from cats to birds to the raccoon living under the porch \u2014 some veterinarians worry the practice can lead owners to make decisions that are not supported by medical science.\nBetsy Lordan, an Ipswich veterinarian who specializes in large animals, said owners who work with animal communicators can often request expensive diagnostics looking for a problem that is not there.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m working with an owner who has spoken with an animal communicator, I\u2019m happy to evaluate whatever they\u2019re concerned with,\u201d Lordan said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not going to substitute appropriate care based on what I\u2019m seeing.\u201d\nAdvertisement It is a sensitive area in the realm of animal care. Many who reach out to communicators are looking for answers that a veterinarian cannot provide, such as the right time to let go of a sick or elderly animal. Or they are seeking a back story for a rescue animal that would explain behavioral issues, which has the potential to feed an \u201cabuse\u201d narrative, according to Lordan, who said that more often the animal has been neglected and improperly socialized and trained before adoption.\nThe Globe contacted several professional veterinary organizations and encountered a reluctance to go on the record about the issue. Rob Halpin, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, would say only that \u201cthe MSPCA believes in science-based methods for diagnosing and treating our pet family members.\u201d\nDeren said that skepticism is part of the gig and she encounters it regularly, particularly from \u201coverly rational types\u201d and \u201chusbands.\u201d\nJim Davis /Globe Staff Susan Deren, a pet communicator, is pictured holding her cellphone in her kitchen with a photo of a dog named Luna. Dawn Allen, an animal communicator in Westfield who said she has worked with more than 7,000 clients over the phone during her 20-year career, said skepticism is necessary and healthy.\n\u201dIt is 100 percent not a fact-based business,\u201d Allen said, \u201cand there\u2019s certainly a suspension of belief because at some point you just have to believe in telepathy to talk about it. So I tell skeptics that there are so many people out there in this world that can help you in so many ways, so if you don\u2019t believe in animal communication, go to a vet or an animal behaviorist or hire a trainer.\u201d\nAllen, who is 44, became interested in the field after reading an article about it while a student at Bates College and then studied under several practitioners. She charges $95 for a 20- to 40-minute session, $105 if it\u2019s urgent. Deren, who says she has been able to speak to animals since she was a small child \u2014 \u201cMy mother thought I was crazy,\u201d she says \u2014 charges clients $75 for a 20-minute call.\nBack in her Haverhill kitchen, Deren is finishing up her 30-minute communication with the pug. Deren has discussed medications, recommending some and cautioning against others, and made diet recommendations. She has also, very dramatically, winced in pain \u2014 \u201clike I was being stabbed in my lower back\u201d \u2014 and advised the owner not to let the dog jump or climb stairs, and instead to carry or lift her. \u201cShe likes when you carry her,\u201d Deren told the woman.\n\u201cI\u2019m just so desperate,\u201d said the dog\u2019s owner, who had agreed to let the Globe listen to her reading. She then went into detail about how she has spent so much money on vets and acupuncturists to make her dog \u2014 who has been having daily seizures \u2014 feel more comfortable. \u201cThis has been very helpful for me. Things I suspected and things I thought about, but having you tell me that and confirm my thoughts is a nice thing, and makes me feel better.\u201d\nAfter Deren hung up, she began to cry.\n\u201cThat dog\u2019s not going to be here long,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad. She\u2019s just out of it. There\u2019s very little going back and forth with me because of all those seizures. It\u2019s like talking to someone who has dementia.\u201d\nThe owner seemed to be dancing around, but never directly asked, the ultimate question: Is it time to say goodbye?\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t ask,\u201d Deren said, and began to cry some more. \u201cThey usually ask. They usually ask.\u201d\nAfter several emotional moments, Deren began to dry her eyes and attempted to compose herself.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse More STUTTGART (Reuters) - Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche said on Tuesday the debate surrounding the safety of Boeing's aircraft shows how hard it can be to win public acceptance for autonomous car technology. In the wake of two plane crashes, regulators across the world have grounded the 737 MAX aircraft pending an investigation into whether Boeing's software-based automated flight control system is safe. \"What is very important is the psychological dimension. If you look at what is happening with Boeing then you can imagine what happens when such a system has an incident,\" Zetsche said, commenting on the motor industry's efforts to develop autonomous cars. Half of U.S. adults think self-driving vehicles are more dangerous than those driven by people, while two-thirds would not buy a fully autonomous vehicle, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found this week. In the same poll, about 63 percent of respondents said they would not pay more to have a self-driving feature on their vehicle, and 41 percent of the rest said they would not pay more than $2,000. Companies developing self-driving technology have put test fleets on public streets, while Alphabet Inc's Waymo unit has deployed a small fleet of self-driving vans to provide rides for customers in Arizona. \"We (in the industry) have a responsibility to educate people about the benefits and the risks of the technology,\" said Chris Urmson, chief executive of self-driving cars start-up Aurora and the former head of Google's autonomous cars project. Accidents, including a fatality involving an Uber test vehicle in Arizona last year, have grabbed public attention and reinforced perceptions that self-driving technology is not yet ready. Regulators for their part have yet to settle on rules applying to more futuristic self-driving cars that would be completely autonomous, not even, for example, having a steering wheel. The auto industry should introduce autonomous systems in stages, as a way to build acceptance for complex but potentially safety-enhancing automotive technology, Zetsche said at the Auto Motor und Sport conference in Stuttgart. \"Even if autonomous cars are 10 times safer than those driven by humans, it takes one spectacular incident to make it much harder to win widespread acceptance,\" he said. Separately Zetsche said Daimler was considering introducing fuel cells to power electric buses and trucks.

Hannah Shaw, an animal advocate known as \"Kitten Lady,\" attends an event in Rayburn Building on bipartisan legislation introduced by Reps. Jimmy Panetta, D-Calif., and Mike Bishop, R-Mich., to end the Department of Agriculture's scientific testing on kittens on June 7, 2018. Tom Williams / CQ Roll Call via AP file Share this \u2014 April 2, 2019, 11:07 AM ET / Updated April 2, 2019, 12:35 PM ET By Dareh Gregorian Government scientists announced Tuesday that they're pulling the plug on a research program that's resulted in the deaths of thousands of cats. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Services lab had been infecting cats with toxoplasmosis and then euthanizing them since 1982 as part of its effort to combat the foodborne illness. The USDA's announcement comes two weeks after NBC News reported on a study that found ARS scientists had bought hundreds of dogs and cats from \"Asian meat markets\" and then had them euthanized and fed to healthy cats at their Maryland lab. In its statement, the USDA said its \"toxoplasmosis research has been redirected and the use of cats as part of any research protocol in any ARS laboratory has been discontinued and will not be reinstated.\" A feline purchased by the USDA facility in Maryland stands on a table in this undated photo obtained by a FOIA request. Felines, like the one shown, are used to breed kittens for taxoplasmosis experiments. WCW Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., who'd called the experiments \"deeply disturbing,\" said the agency \u201cmade the right decision today, and I applaud them for their willingness to change course. It\u2019s a good day for our four-legged friends across America.\u201d The authors of the \"USDA Kitten Cannibalism\" study, the nonprofit White Coat Waste Project, said the gruesome experiments showed the agency had gone far astray from its mission of keeping the U.S. food supply safe. In its statement, the USDA did not mention the \"cat cannibalism\" experiments, but it did say that \"ARS toxoplasmosis research has reached its maturity and ARS considers the project\u2019s objectives for agriculture achieved. While there is still additional research needed in this area regarding human health, this research area is outside of USDA\u2019s stated mission.\" ARS Administrator Dr. Chavonda Jacobs-Young said, \u201cWe are excited for the next chapter of work for these scientists and this laboratory.\u201d The agency said no cats have been infected with toxoplasmosis pathogens or euthanized since September 2018, and that the 14 healthy cats they still have at the facility are in the process of being adopted by USDA employees. Rep. Jimmy Panetta, D-Calif., who'd been pushing legislation aimed at ending the experiments called the Kittens in Traumatic Testing Ends Now Act, said, \"I commend the USDA for their decision to end this type of testing on kittens. They listened to the people and responded appropriately to our concerns. This is how our institutions, our government, and our democracy should and must work.\" Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., lead co-sponsor of the KITTEN Act, said, \u201cWith all the awful reports coming out, it was clear that Americans opposed USDA\u2019s cruel testing on kittens. This is a decisive victory against government animal abuse and wasteful spending.\u201d Anthony Bellotti, the founder of the White Coat Waste Project, which combats wasteful government spending on animal testing and had waged a year-long campaign against the cat experiments, called the move \"a historic victory for taxpayers and animals.\" \"After 3,000-plus kittens killed and $22 million squandered, we applaud the USDA for its wise decision to permanently end its taxpayer-funded kitten experiments and adopt out the survivors,\" Bellotti said, adding that he was \"elated\" that \"the USDA\u2019s kitten slaughterhouse has finally been relegated to the litterbox of history.\" Dareh Gregorian Dareh Gregorian writes for NBC News.

While there is still additional research needed in this area regarding human health, this research area is outside of USDA's stated mission.\"\nARS Administrator Dr. Chavonda Jacobs-Young said, \"We are excited for the next chapter of work for these scientists and this laboratory.\"\nThe agency said no cats have been infected with toxoplasmosis pathogens or euthanized since September 2018, and that the 14 healthy cats they still have at the facility are in the process of being adopted by USDA employees.\nRep. Jimmy Panetta, D-Calif., who'd been pushing legislation aimed at ending the experiments, said, \"I commend the USDA for their decision to end this type of testing on kittens. They listened to the people and responded appropriately to our concerns. This is how our institutions, our government, and our democracy should and must work.\"\nAnthony Bellotti, the founder of the White Coat Waste Project, which combats wasteful government spending on animal testing and had campaigned against the cat experiments, called the move \"a historic victory for taxpayers and animals.\"\n\"After 3,000-plus kittens killed and $22 million squandered, we applaud the USDA for its wise decision to permanently end its taxpayer-funded kitten experiments and adopt out the survivors,\" Bellotti said, adding that he was \"elated\" that \"the USDA's kitten slaughterhouse has finally been relegated to the litterbox of history.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/cat-cannibalism-report-discloses-questionable-gov-t-animal-experiments-n984546", "http://www.nbcnews.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom wil", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nbc news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hannah shaw government", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of agriculture's agricultural research services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white coat waste project", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "maryland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T19:42:06.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d6c38287ea7ecf2c496ae49f02c6127b7e8c106e", "url": "https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/air-canada-revises-schedule-for-may-as-boeing-737-max-remains-grounded-1.4362165", "site_full": "toronto.ctvnews.ca", "site": "ctvnews.ca", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "education", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "Air Canada revises schedule for May as Boeing 737 Max remains grounded | CTV News Toronto", "title_full": "Air Canada revises schedule for May as Boeing 737 Max remains grounded | CTV News Toronto", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.049, "main_image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4342100.1553002129!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4971, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 10, "comments": 1, "shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d6c38287ea7ecf2c496ae49f02c6127b7e8c106e", "url": "https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/air-canada-revises-schedule-for-may-as-boeing-737-max-remains-grounded-1.4362165", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Air Canada revises schedule for May as Boeing 737 Max remains grounded | CTV News Toronto", "text": "Air Date: March 29, 2019 Air Canada revises schedule for May as Boeing 737 Max remains grounded\nAn Air Canada Boeing 737 Max aircraft arriving from Toronto prepares to land at Vancouver International Airport in Richmond, B.C., on March 12, 2019.

Cat-scratch disease caused by B. henselae in Croatia was first described in 1957. It is present throughout the country: a survey of serum samples from 268 Croatian patients with lymphadenopathy showed that 37.7% had IgG antibodies. Despite this prevalence, we are unaware of reports of Bartonella culturing from infected humans or cats in Croatia or elsewhere in southeast Europe. Case presentation Here we describe the diagnosis of a 12-year-old child with lymphadenopathy in Croatia with cat-scratch disease based on antibody detection and clinical signs, and the subsequent culturing and genotyping of B.henselae from the cat\u2019s blood. The B. henselae isolate was grown on different blood agar plates and its identity was confirmed based on polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) amplification of 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (16S rDNA) and sequencing. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) identified the strain genotype as sequence type 5, commonly found zoonotic B. henselae strain in cats. The child recovered after azithromycin therapy, and B. henselae in the cat was eliminated within three months after doxycycline treatment. Conclusions This is, to our knowledge, the first report of B. henselae culturing and MLST-based genotyping from cat\u2019s blood in southeast Europe. Our ability to detect B. henselae in blood through culturing but not PCR suggests that the prevalence of infected cats with low bacteremia is very high, suggesting the need to develop faster, more sensitive detection assays. Background The bacterial genus Bartonella is distributed worldwide and poses a public health risk [ 1 ]. More than 20 species cause infections in specific mammalian reservoir hosts; Bartonella henselae, for example, is one of the most frequent causes of zoonoses acquired from companion animals in industrialized countries. B. henselae is a pleomorphic, aerobic, Gram-negative bacterium that causes cat-scratch disease, which involves chronic lymphadenopathy and affects predominantly children and adolescents [ 2 ]. Domestic cats, especially young cats and kittens, are the primary reservoirs of B. henselae; up to 40% of domestic cats may be infected, and infections can be difficult to detect because no clinical signs may be observed even more than one year after infection [ 3 ]. Cats can infect humans directly with B. henselae through scratching and biting [ 1 , 2 , 4 ] or licking. On rare occasions, humans can be infected through bites of Ctenocephalides felis , a cat flea [ 1 ] that transmits B. henselae within cat populations [ 5 ]. Cat-scratch disease in Croatia was first described in 1957 [ 6 ], and since then only a few cases have been reported in the country. These cases were atypical because the clinical signs did not include peripheral lymphadenopathy but rather pancreatic duodenal lymphadenitis, fever, and abdominal pain [ 7 ] or osteomyelitis of the right humerus [ 8 ]. The presence of B. henselae in these patients was deduced from the clinical presentation, epidemiological history and presence of anti- B. henselae antibodies based on an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). B. henselae is likely to be present throughout the country, since a survey of serum samples from 268 Croatian patients with lymphadenopathy showed that 37.7% patients had IgG antibodies against B. henselae [ 9 ]. Over a quarter of patients (28.3%) in that study had IgM antibodies, indicating acute infection. Another study in Croatia showed even higher prevalence of IgG antibodies among healthy adults (31 of 54, 57.4%) and healthy children (19 of 46, 41.3%) [ 6 ]. Despite this prevalence, we are unaware of reports of Bartonella sp. culturing from infected humans or cats in Croatia or elsewhere in southeast Europe. In the absence of a consensus standard for diagnosing cat-scratch disease [ 10 , 11 ], the best initial diagnostic tests are considered to be serological methods, such as indirect fluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ 12 ], while the gold standard is culturing Bartonella sp. from the blood or tissues of infected humans or cats [ 13 \u2013 16 ], followed by molecular characterization [ 15 , 16 ]. However, culturing Bartonella sp. from humans and animals remains challenging [ 16 \u2013 19 ] and has yet to be optimized [ 19 , 20 ]. Here we describe the culture and genotyping of B. henselae from cat\u2019s blood in Croatia, which appears to be the first such report from this country and, more broadly, from southeast Europe. The bacterium was cultured on various agar plates, and the strain was identified using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Case presentation A12-year-old boy living in Zagreb, Croatia presented at a large pediatric clinic in the Croatian capital of Zagreb with acute enlargement of a regional lymph nodes. He was afebrile and reported pain in the axillar and antebrachial regions of the left arm that had persisted for the preceding three days. Palpation revealed a painful formation measuring approximately 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091.5\u2009cm in medial on the lower third of the left upper arm. A few smaller lymph nodes, the largest being 1\u2009cm, were palpable in the left axillae. The patient did not show or report any other clinical signs. All haematological and biochemical parameters were within physiological ranges, including CRP. Cat-scratch disease was suspected based on anamnesis and clinical findings. Blood was taken for serological testing, and a 5-day regimen of azithromycin (500\u2009mg/day) was prescribed. Ultrasonography of the left axillae and upper arm showed lymphadenopathy typical of cat-scratch disease. Ultrasonography performed at a private clinic revealed approximately 10 smaller lymph nodes and a few larger ones (17\u201327\u2009mm) showing homogeneous cortex thickness on the left and no obvious differences from the contralateral region. IFAs were performed using a commercial kit (Focus Diagnostics, USA) in the Department of Clinical Microbiology, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases \u201cDr Fran Mihaljevi\u0107\u201d (Zagreb, Croatia), and the assays revealed a titer of 1:512 for IgG antibodies against B. henselae and 1:128 for IgG antibodies against B. quintana (positivity defined as \u22651:64 according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions). The assays were negative for IgM antibodies against both bacteria. Following azithromycin treatment, the patient showed improved status, no pain, and normal-sized lymph nodes in the left upper arm. The patient\u2019s parents indicated that they owned one cat and one dog, and that the patient played frequently with the cat. The cat was an apparently healthy, 10-month-old female British shorthair that lived primarily indoors but had free access to a yard; the cat had a history of flea infestation. When a diagnosis of cat-scratch disease was suspected, a sample of the cat\u2019s blood was collected at a private veterinary clinic and delivered to the Croatian Veterinary Institute for analysis. Upon isolation of B. henselae from the blood (see below), the cat was treated for 3\u2009weeks with doxycycline (10\u2009mg/kg body weight p/o every 12\u2009h) [ 21 , 22 ], and the patient\u2019s parents were advised to protect the cat against ectoparasites. Both when a diagnosis of cat-scratch disease was suspected and again three months later (following doxycycline treatment), cat\u2019s blood was collected in K2-EDTA tubes (Vacuette, Greiner) and stored overnight at \u2212\u200918\u2009\u00b0C to lyse erythrocytes and release bacteria. The frozen blood was thawed at room temperature, and aliquots (200\u2009\u03bcL) were plated in duplicate onto Tryptic soy agar with 5% defibrinated sheep blood (TSA) and Brain heart agar with 5% defibrinated rabbit blood (BH). Both agar bases were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and used to prepare \u201cready-to-use\u201d plates. Blood was inoculated onto the plates by simultaneously tilting them at a 45-degree angle and rotating them, allowing the blood to flow across the agar without the need for an inoculating loop or mechanical streaking [ 23 , 24 ]. The plates were then incubated, agar side down, at 37\u2009\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 8% CO 2 [ 19 , 25 ]. At three days after inoculation, plates were inverted to sit agar side up. At six days after inoculation, single colonies from each type of plate were picked for molecular analysis (see next section). At the same time, single colonies from two TSA plates were subcultured onto two fresh TSA plates, while single colonies from one BH plate were subcultured onto a single fresh BH plate. Cat\u2019s blood after doxycycline treatment was plated onto two fresh TSA and BH plates. Subcultured and plates inoculated after doxycycline treatment were incubated under the same conditions as the first set of plates. Colonies from plates that were subsequently identified as Bartonella spp. by PCR were stored at \u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C in Brucella broth supplemented with 10% glycerol ( v /v) [ 26 ]. DNA was extracted from 200\u2009\u03bcl EDTA blood and from six cultures using the QIAcube automated DNA isolation system and QiaAmp DNAmini QIAcube Kit, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for blood and tissue (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). In order to determine whether isolates belonged to the genus Bartonella, DNA from six culture isolates were used as template in conventional PCR targeting 16S rRNA (16S-R as forward primer: F 5\u2032-GCC YCC TTG CGG TTA GCA CAG CA-3\u2032 and P24Emod as reverse primer: R 5\u2032-CCT TCA GTT MGG CTG GAT C-3\u2032) as well as the intergenic transcribed spacer between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes (Bart/16-23F as forward primer: 5\u2032-TTG ATA AGC GTG AGG TCG GAG G-3\u2032 and Bart/16-23R as reverse primer: 5\u2032-CAA AGC AGG TGC TCT CCC AG-3\u2032) [ 27 ]. The DNA extracted from cultures served as template for MLST at the following nine loci in housekeeping genes [ 28 ]: 16S rRNA gene, batR, eno, ftsZ, gltA, groEL, nlpD, ribC, and rpoB . MLST sequences were assembled, processed and compared using BioNumerics 7.6 software (Applied Maths, Belgium), which identified alleles and sequence types based on published profiles [ 28 ]. Alleles were assigned 9-digit numerical codes and compared using the categorical coefficient and hierarchical clustering using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) method. MLST results were compared with sequence types (STs) in the B. henselae database ( http://bhenselae.mlst.net/ ) [ 29 ]. At three days after inoculation, plates did not show visible colonies, although a few plates contained \u201cshiny islets\u201d suggestive of initial bacterial growth. At six days after inoculation, two TSA plates and one BH plate showed visible Bartonella- like colonies (Table 1 ). Upon subculturing onto two fresh TSA plates and one fresh BH plate, growth was visible on all three plates after four days, and it was abundant after six days (Table 1 ). A blood sample taken from the cat after doxycycline treatment did not give rise to bacterial growth even after one month of incubation.

According to the USAF, its inspectors found tools and other debris inside the planes. This is the second time in a month the Air Force has halted delivery of the KC-46 for the same reason.

The United States Air Force has once again rejected taking delivery of new Boeing KC-46 Pegasus tanker jets after discovering foreign object debris (FOD) left inside the aircraft by Boeing workers . This is the second time the USAF has stopped accepting deliveries of new KC-46s this year for the same exact reason, Reuters reported. The Air Force initially halted deliveries of the Boeing 767 airliner-based tanker planes for two weeks in early March. At the time, assistant secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Will Roper, told reporters that debris such as tools was left in parts of the plane that could be a potential safety hazard, Defense News reported. According to Reuters, the Air Force decided to halt deliveries again on March 23. \"The Air Force again halted acceptance of new KC-46 tanker aircraft as we continue to work with Boeing to ensure that every aircraft delivered meets the highest quality and safety standards,\" a USAF spokesperson told the Air Force Times in an emailed statement . \"This week our inspectors identified additional foreign object debris and areas where Boeing did not meet quality standards.\" Read more : FAA expects Boeing to come up with new software to fix the grounded 737 Max in a matter of weeks . \"Resolving this issue is a company and program priority \u2014 Boeing is committed to delivering FOD-free aircraft to the Air Force,\" Boeing told Business Insider in a statement. \"Although we've made improvements to date, we can do better.\" \"We are currently conducting additional company and customer inspections of the jets and have implemented preventative action plans,\" the Boeing statement went on to say. \"We have also incorporated additional training, more rigorous clean-as-you-go practices and FOD awareness days across the company to stress the importance and urgency of this issue. Safety and quality are our highest priority.\" Boeing commenced deliveries of the KC-46 tanker in January. The plane was originally slated for delivery to the Air Force in 2017.

Thursday's appeal ruling showed that the United States did not stop all subsidies when asked to do so, echoing an earlier finding against the EU.\nThe WTO's Appellate Body, effectively the supreme court of world trade, ruled that the business and occupancy (B&O) tax rate reduction in Washington state had significantly cut Airbus sales in five particularly price-sensitive sales campaigns.\n\"The Appellate Body has now settled this case definitively, confirming our view the U.S. has continued to subsidise Boeing despite WTO rulings to the contrary,\" European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said in a statement.\nThe U.S. Trade Representative's office called the ruling \"a major win for the United States\", since it had found only one illegal subsidy remaining after it had complied with earlier rulings. Boeing said it would support the new decision.\nAny sanctions could broadly target industries beyond aerospace, but the impact of the record trade dispute on Boeing and Airbus themselves has so far been modest.\nAnalysts have long predicted the case would peter out or be settled without a trade war, but the prospect of retaliation is grabbing more attention than before amid global trade tensions.\nCOUNTERMEASURES\nAirbus said Boeing still received a raft of support and urged the United States to negotiate a \"fair-trade environment\" - a settlement proposal that Washington has so far rejected.\nIn a technical point, it said the WTO had resurrected a wider group of U.S. subsidies which could be challenged later.\nBut Boeing said the slate had now been wiped clean of any unlawful subsidies in the United States, except for the Washington-state measure which it agreed would now be amended.\n\"We trust that our example will prompt Airbus and the European Union to immediately bring themselves into full compliance with the substantial rulings against these parties by the WTO,\" Boeing said in a statement.\nIn a parallel ruling last year, the WTO said the European Union had failed to remove illegal subsidies for two airplane programmes, the A350 and the A380 - the world's largest airliner which Airbus has since decided to stop building due to poor sales.\nThat part of the row simmers on as Airbus argues the case against European government loans for the A380 no longer counts because of its plans to shut production. The United States says the partly unpaid loans continue to damage Boeing indirectly.\nThe two sides are now in arbitration to decide the size of any countermeasures, starting with a U.S. request for authorisation to impose $11 billion in sanctions on EU goods.\n(Reporting by Tom Miles and Tim Hepher, editing by Stephanie Nebehay and Toby Chopra)\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

Boeing is releasing details of its proposed software upgrade to its anti-stall system later on Wednesday.\nJohn Hamilton, chief engineer for 737 Max flight displays at Boeing's commercial airplanes unit, said in a statement that \"all primary flight information required to safely and efficiently operate the 737 MAX\" was already included without the features that would now be offered without Boeing charging extra for them.\nHe said the AOA indicator \"provides supplementary information to the flight crew. The AOA disagree alert provides additional context for understanding the possible cause of air speed and altitude differences between the pilot\u2019s and first officer\u2019s displays.\"\nIt is not yet known what caused the crash of an Ethiopia Airlines 737 MAX on March 10 and a crash involving the same jet model belonging to Indonesia's Lion Air five months earlier.\nBut Reuters reported in November after the Lion Air disaster that some experts believed the optional alert could have alerted engineers about mechanical faults, sparking an industry debate over whether installing the system should become mandatory.\nThe angle of attack is a key flight parameter that must remain narrow enough to preserve lift and avoid an aerodynamic stall.\nA faulty AOA reading led the doomed Lion Air jet\u2019s computer to believe it was stalled, prompting the plane\u2019s new anti-stall system, called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), to repeatedly push down the nose, according to Indonesian investigators.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Tom Brown)\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

Unfortunately, if bad sensor data is fed into it, the software will repeatedly try to override the pilots' controls, and force down the plane, unless the crew managed to flip the right switches to disable it. The pilots have about 40 seconds to kill the safety component before it kills them, simulations later discovered. A warning indicator that all is not well with the sensor data was an optional extra that budget airlines tended to skip.\nThe 8 and 9 versions of the 737 Max fleet have been pretty much grounded worldwide since mid-March as the Washington-based Boeing works to make their MCAS code safe, mainly by detecting whether its angle-of-attack sensor data is legit or faulty before making any critical decisions. Now, both the FAA and Boeing say the fleet will stay out of service at least a few weeks longer than planned.\n\"The FAA expects to receive Boeing\u2019s final package of its software enhancement over the coming weeks for FAA approval. Time is needed for additional work by Boeing as the result of an ongoing review of the 737 MAX Flight Control System to ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues,\" a spokesperson for the US aviation body told El Reg . Ethiopian Airlines boss confirms suspect flight software was in use as Boeing 737 Max crashed READ MORE\n\"Upon receipt, the FAA will subject Boeing\u2019s completed submission to a rigorous safety review. The FAA will not approve the software for installation until the agency is satisfied with the submission.\"\nMeanwhile, the airline jet maker told us: \"Boeing continues to work with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and other regulatory agencies worldwide on the development and certification of the MCAS software update and training program.\n\"We are working to demonstrate that we have identified and appropriately addressed all certification requirements and will be submitting for FAA review once completed in the coming weeks. Safety is our first priority, and we will take a thorough and methodical approach to the development and testing of the update to ensure we take the time to get it right.\"\nWhile no definitive timeline was given, the statements of both Boeing and the FAA would suggest the fix would likely not be in place until some time in May, at the soonest. Not just a software issue\nWhile new software is welcome, it's worth reiterating that, at this stage, it appears the cause of the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes wasn't entirely code related.\nIt seems a faulty angle-of-attack sensor in the aircraft's nose emitted bad readings that convinced the on-board computer that the aircraft was about to stall, causing it to push the plane's nose lower to recover the situation. MCAS is supposed to try this just a few times before giving up, but each time the pilots took back control, the system would reset its counter, meaning every time the pilots pulled up, MCAS would try again to nose down, eventually driving the aircraft into the sea or ground.\nWhat concerns some in the aviation field is that MCAS is governed by a single sensor, rather than multiple sensors that would provide redundancy and cross checking. Having one sensor fail is not uncommon, and the result should not involve the thing flying itself into the ground, which is why Boeing has to join up its software to more sensors.\nNeither Boeing nor the FAA have confirmed exactly what changes will be made to the MCAS software, though it looks certain that the code is only part of the problem.\nNevertheless the pressure is on to get the world's 737 Max fleets back in the air. American Airlines, one of Boeing's biggest customers, is having to cancel about 90 flights a day at the moment, and another big customer, Norwegian, is reportedly considering legal action against Boeing for the costs the budget airline has incurred from having its fleet grounded. \u00ae", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.b737.org.uk/mcas.htm"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "boeing", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "faa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T23:39:16.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dec520c3071613124ef343b21c6a418df0b6ead6", "url": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/spca-investigating-after-3-great-danes-2-cats-found-dead-on-n-b-roadway-1.4362730", "site_full": "www.ctvnews.ca", "site": "ctvnews.ca", "site_section": "http://www.ctvnews.ca/rss/ctvnews-ca-canada-public-rss-1.822284", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "CTVNews.ca - Canada - Public RSS", "title": "SPCA investigating after 3 Great Danes, 2 cats found dead on N.B. roadway", "title_full": "SPCA investigating after 3 Great Danes, 2 cats found dead on N.B. roadway | CTV News", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4362007.1554213742!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 4971, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 702, "comments": 81, "shares": 150}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dec520c3071613124ef343b21c6a418df0b6ead6", "url": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/spca-investigating-after-3-great-danes-2-cats-found-dead-on-n-b-roadway-1.4362730", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CTVNews.ca Staff, with files from CTV Atlantic", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "SPCA investigating after 3 Great Danes, 2 cats found dead on N.B. roadway", "text": "WARNING: This story contains disturbing details\nThe SPCA in New Brunswick is asking the public for information after three Great Danes and two cats were found dead on the side of the road.\nFor more on this story, visit CTV Atlantic The SPCA wrote in a Facebook post that the animals were found on the side of a roadway in Memramcook, just south of Moncton, N.B. at around 7:30 a.m. on Monday.

\u201cto ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues,\u201d a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said in a statement.\n\u201cThe FAA will not approve the software for installation until the agency is satisfied with the submission,\u201d he added.\nRead more Boeing anti-stall system was activated in Ethiopia crash: source Daily Business Wrap - Boeing issues software update following crashes EU agency said to have skipped 737 Max meeting in snub to Boeing The FAA statement is the bureaucratic equivalent of a \u201cstop\u201d sign after Boeing officials touted their proposed remedy last week during a media tour at the company\u2019s manufacturing plant in Seattle, Washington.\nBoeing\u2019s 737 MAX planes were grounded globally last month following the second of two deadly crashes to occur in less than five months.\nScrutiny has centered on an anti-stall system developed specifically for the planes that has given pilots problems.\nA preliminary report into the second calamity \u2014 the March 10 crash of a Boeing 737 MAX 8 that killed 157 people \u2014 will likely be issued this week, the Ethiopian government said Monday.\nBoeing last week gathered hundreds of pilots and reporters at its Renton, Washington manufacturing site for a presentation on proposed changes to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which is believed to have been a key factor in the Ethiopian crash and in an October crash of a Lion Air in Indonesia that killed 189 people.\nAmong the changes, the MCAS will no longer repeatedly make corrections when the pilot tries to regain control, and will automatically disconnect in the event of disagreements between the two \u201cangle of attack,\u201d or AOA sensors, the company said last week.\nBoeing is anxious to win approval for a proposed remedy that could get the planes back in the air.\nBut the FAA, which faced harsh questioning last week at a congressional hearing regarding its oversight of Boeing, said it expected Boeing to submit the proposed fix \u201cover the coming weeks\u201d after it undertakes additional work.\nAfter that, the proposal will be submitted to a \u201crigorous safety review,\u201d the FAA spokesman said.\nPreliminary report this week Earlier Monday, Ethiopian foreign ministry spokesman Nebiat Getachew said the transport ministry would release \u201ca preliminary report into its investigation\u201d of the March 10 accident in which a Nairobi-bound Boeing 737 MAX crashed shortly after taking off from Addis Ababa.\nThe Ethiopian government gave no details on the exact timing of the release, nor hints about the report\u2019s findings.\nNebiat initially said the report would be released Monday but the transport ministry, which is in charge of investigations, later said it would still be some days.\n\u201cThe report will most likely be released some day later this week,\u201d ministry spokesman Mussie Yiheyes said.\nIt was not clear Monday if the transport ministry\u2019s preliminary report would be made public straight away, or limited to the eyes of authorities including the FAA.\nThe plane\u2019s black boxes are being examined by France\u2019s BEA air safety agency, working with American and Ethiopian investigators to determine what went wrong.\nAnti-stall system A source with knowledge of the investigation has said an anti-stalling system, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), was activated shortly before the crash.\nBoeing designed the automated MCAS system \u2014 which lowers the aircraft\u2019s nose if it detects a stall or loss of airspeed \u2014 for this particular model.\nThe same system was implicated in the October crash, with initial investigations finding that a sensor on the plane had transmitted incorrect information to the MCAS system.\nThe pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 struggled to control the aircraft as the MCAS repeatedly pushed the plane\u2019s nose down, according to the flight data recorder.\nThe pilot had tried repeatedly to regain control and pull the nose up but the plane crashed into the sea.\nBoth the planes in Indonesia and Ethiopia reportedly experienced erratic steep climbs and descents, as well as fluctuating airspeeds, before crashing shortly after takeoff.\nEthiopia has already said there were \u201cclear similarities\u201d between the two MAX 8 crashes.\nEthiopian Airlines is Africa\u2019s largest carrier and in many ways the international face of the nation.\nMore From Aviation Ethiopia to issue first Boeing investigation report

The FAA said that it expects Boeing\u2019s (NYSE: BA) software patch for the scrutinized anti-stall system in \u201cthe coming weeks,\u201d but notes that \u201ctime is needed for additional work by Boeing.\u201d That additional work, the FAA said, is the result of an ongoing review of the aircraft\u2019s flight control system. \u201cUpon receipt, the FAA will subject Boeing\u2019s completed submission to a rigorous safety review,\u201d the agency said. \u201cThe FAA will not approve the software for installation until the agency is satisfied with the submission.\u201d The statement follows questions on Capitol Hill about the FAA\u2019s previous certification process for the new MAX variant, which remains grounded following two deadly crashes in just over five months. Boeing unveiled its planned fixes last week, including the software upgrades and enhanced pilot training intended to deal with issues caused by the jet\u2019s new Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). That system was pointed to as a potential cause in a preliminary report on the Lion Air crash in October, and has reportedly come under scrutiny again as having played a potential role in the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 last month. A final cause of either crash has yet to be released. The two crashes killed 356 people and prompted a global grounding and federal inquiries into Boeing's best selling single-aisle jet. But reports that investigators in both crash probes had potentially zeroed in on the same system was a cue to investors that Boeing\u2019s planned fixes \u2014 which had been in the works since the Lion Air crash \u2014 could be enough to get the narrow-body jets back in the air. Shares of Boeing began rising on Friday following reports that the system was believed to have been engaged at the time of the Ethiopian Airlines crash. Share continued to rise on Monday and closed at $391.54, up 2.7 percent, amid reports that an official preliminary report on that crash was expected soon. That was part of broader gain by the markets on Monday, which also saw shares of Spirit AeroSystems Inc. rise 2.3 percent to close at $93.65. Spirit (NYSE: SPR) in Wichita builds around 70 percent of the structure on every 737 that Boeing delivers. Production on the 737 has continued at the rate of 52 aircraft per month, despite the global grounding and Boeing\u2019s own halt of customer deliveries on the new MAX variants. The MAX was expected to account for around 90 percent of all 737 deliveries this year.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "faa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "federal aviation administration", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "boeing", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T03:28:38.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "317b003f953e79355595c1f798d733b62a69b763", "url": "https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/spca-seeks-to-ban-cruel-and-unjustifiable-declawing-of-cats-1.4362009", "site_full": "montreal.ctvnews.ca", "site": "ctvnews.ca", "site_section": "http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/rss/MontrealLatest", "site_categories": ["media", "education", "entertainment"], "section_title": "CTV News - Montreal", "title": "SPCA seeks to ban 'cruel and unjustifiable' declawing of cats", "title_full": "SPCA seeks to ban 'cruel and unjustifiable' declawing of cats | CTV News Montreal", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.3977365.1529274431!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4971, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 416, "comments": 17, "shares": 45}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "317b003f953e79355595c1f798d733b62a69b763", "url": "https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/spca-seeks-to-ban-cruel-and-unjustifiable-declawing-of-cats-1.4362009", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CTV Montreal", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "SPCA seeks to ban 'cruel and unjustifiable' declawing of cats", "text": "SPCA seeks to ban 'cruel and unjustifiable' declawing of cats CTV Montreal Published Tuesday, April 2, 2019 11:03AM EDT Last Updated Tuesday, April 2, 2019 9:00PM EDT\nThe Montreal SPCA has launched an appeal to the Quebec Order of Veterinarians to ban the declawing of cats - a procedure they say is \"cruel and unjustifiable\"\nOn Tuesday, the organization started an online petition which garnered over 2,000 signatures in the first hour.\nThe web page provides a number of infographics to illustrate the reality of the declawing procedure, like the one seen below:\n(Graphic courtesy of Montreal SPCA)\nAccording to the SPCA, 30 countries worldwide have already implemented a ban.\nLast year, they were joined by Nova Scotia, British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Prince Edward Island. Several other Canadian provinces are also in line to take a stand against declawing.\nIn 2017, the Order of Quebec Veterinarians did ban a number of non-essential cosmetic procedures , such as ear cropping and docked tails on dogs, cats, cattle, or horses - a decision that didn't sit well with dog breeders.\nIn a statement released on Tuesday , the Order said the declawing of cats is not medically necessary, can lead to complications, and affect an animal's overall wellbeing.\nHowever, they added that education for pet owners is a crucial step before proceeding with a legal ban.\n\"We want to better inform the public and support veterinarians in their efforts to raise awareness among their clients, which is why we launched [a campaign] which offers a series of communication tools that address this important animal welfare issue,\" Dr. Caroline Kilsdonk, President of the Quebec Order of Veterinarians, said in the statement.\nVeterinarian Enid Stiles of the Sherwood Park Animal Hospital said she stopped declawing cats 17 years ago.\n\u201cThis is completely unnecessary and unethical thing to do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's an amputation of the very top digit of the cat's claws, so it's actually a bony amputation called a partial digit amputation.\u201d\nSophie Gaillard, the SPCA\u2019s director of animal advocacy equated it to torture.\n\u201cThat is the human equivalent of basically chopping off every single one of the end of my fingers and then having me walking on them the rest of my life,\u201d she said.

The FAA has come under criticism for delegating some of its certification responsibilities to Boeing and other manufacturers.\nIn his letter, Wicker asked acting FAA administrator Daniel Elwell to provide answers to detailed questions by April 16.\nWATCH: Transportation regulators asked about troubled Boeing 737 Max during hearing\nAsked about the claims, the FAA referred to Elwell\u2019s testimony at a Senate hearing last week in which he said \u201cthe FAA welcomes external review of our systems, processes, and recommendations.\u201d\nThe FAA has a \u201cvery good whistleblower program,\u201d Elwell said at the hearing, and added: \u201cThere were no comments made by employees to our knowledge.\u201d\nWicker\u2019s letter said the whistleblowers alleged that safety inspectors without proper safety training could have been participants on the Flight Standardization Board that evaluated the 737 MAX 8 to \u201cdetermine the requirements for pilot type ratings, to develop minimum training recommendations, and to ensure initial flightcrew member competency.\u201d\nREAD MORE: U.S. and Europe regulators knew Boeing 737 MAX\u2019s nose angle might not work \u2014 2 years before Lion Air\nWicker\u2019s letter also says the committee is \u201cled to believe that an FAA investigation into these allegations may have been completed recently.\u201d\nBoeing said last week that it was reprogramming software on its 737 MAX passenger jet to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system that is under mounting scrutiny following the two deadly nose-down crashes.\nWATCH: Some safety features sold as options on Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX jets\nThe world\u2019s largest planemaker said the anti-stall system, which is believed to have repeatedly forced the nose lower in the Indonesia accident, would only do so one time after sensing a problem, giving pilots more control.\nOn Monday, Boeing and the FAA said Boeing\u2019s planned software fix and training revision would be submitted to the FAA for approval in \u201cthe coming weeks.\u201d The company previously said it planned to deliver the fix for government approval by last week.

Singapore Airlines was the first carrier in the world to fly this brand new version of the Dreamliner.\nThis latest glitch in Boeing planes comes after airlines across the world grounded their Boeing 737 Max aircraft fleets after two catastrophic crashes of Boeing 737 Max planes operated by Lion Air and Ethiopian Air occurred in a five month span. Investigators criticised the 737's stabilisation software MCAS as a possible cause for these crashes.\nAccording to sources that told Singapore's Strait Times, the new Boeing 787-10s are fitted with the latest Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 TEN engines, an improved version of the Trent 1000 engine that reported cracked blade issues. This same cracked blade issue was now seen in the new TEN engines as well, first reported in an SIA operated 787-10 flight in Nagoya, Japan on March 30th.\nIt was unclear as to how many Boeing 787-10 jets were grounded by SIA.

In addition, the officials told Garima Sethi that Boeing had reassured them that the aircraft was safe.\nThe October 29 crash near Jakarta opened global probes into potential problems with an anti-stall system on the popular Boeing plane.\nSethi, 31, said that a second crash of a Boeing Max jet in Ethiopia could have been prevented if the appeals by the victims' families were given more weight by Lion Air and others.\n\"We tried to do our part, but nobody heard us.\"\nTalking about the Ethiopia crash, Sethi said: \"It was altogether the same story. I don't have any words.\"\nShe said she was distressed to learn that the Ethiopian Airlines jet that crashed had been delivered by Boeing in mid-November, after the Lion Air disaster. \"They were playing with lives.\"\nA spokesman for Lion Air and Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee declined to comment on Sethi's views.\nBoeing had repeatedly assured that the 737 Max was safe but it was grounded globally after the Ethio\u00adpian Airlines crash.\nA preliminary report from Indonesian experts released in November focused on possible flawed readings by an anti-stall feature on the 737 Max. Investigators believe the system redirected the nose of the plane downward, leaving the cockpit crew unable to override the autopilot commands.\nA similar scenario is being investigated as the potential cause for the Ethio\u00adpian crash, the Washington Post said.\nSethi's husband Suneja was a methodical pilot and a stickler for pre-flight inspections, she said. On October 29, the plane he was about to pilot had experienced mechanical issues on its previous flight.\nSethi said that after the October crash, Suneja's colleagues told her that Lion Air's pilots had received no training on the Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), the anti-stall software.\nIndonesian officials said last year that Boeing's manual for the new plane did not fully describe the system or how to disable it, according to the report.\nDuring a meeting with Lion Air officials, Sethi said she urged them to ground the Max planes. \"We suggested if it was a software glitch, why not ground it for a while?\"\n\"I'm just looking for justice,\" Sethi said, adding that whoever was at fault \"should claim their mistakes\".\nSome of the families of Lion Air victims have filed lawsuits against Boeing, but Sethi said she has not decided whether to pursue a legal claim.\n--IANS\nsoni/mr (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Lockheed Martin has offered to shift its entire F-16 manufacturing base from US to India.\n\"What we're talking about is a complete ecosystem of capability it's building up supply chain, it's building up engineering capacity, technical mechanical capacity. It is bringing the build, not the kit, to India,\" Marc Allen, president of Boeing International and a member of the Boeing Executive Council, told PTI.\nLast month, Allen was named senior vice president of Boeing and president of Embraer Partnership and Group Operations.\nBoeing has offered that future F/A-18 Super Hornet upgrades can be co-developed with India, maximising performance, affordability, indigenisation for decades.\nThe McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet is a twin-engine, supersonic, all-weather, carrier-capable, multirole combat jet, designed as both a fighter and attack aircraft.\nAs a result, Allen argued, the impact will be transformational - building a next gen warfighter in India and a 21st century aerospace ecosystem with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and Mahindra along with Boeing industry's partners (GE Aviation, GKN Aero, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon).\n\"And that's why the idea of being able to service, both the Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force requirements together is so vital because it creates a volume that supports industrial development at a massive scale,\" Allen said in response to a question.\nBoeing says that the 'Make in India' programme for the Super Hornet has been envisioned for aircraft made in India for India. The Super Hornet production line will exist in the US to meet the immediate needs of its American and international customers.\nIndia is to build an entirely new line, leveraging Boeing's commercial and defence experience, Allen said.\nThe Super Hornet is the airplane that fits the requirement of both the Indian Navy and Airforce, he asserted.\nBoeing says that the Super Hornet offering for India co-opts the expertise of a public-private partnership with HAL and Mahindra to make the F/A-18 Super Hornet in an advanced Factory-of-the-Future in India.\nThe partnership, it asserts, will harness productivity opportunities in India to deliver more-for-less (more capability for less cost) to its Indian customers and worldwide.\nNoting that its current F/A-18 production involves 60,000 jobs and 800 suppliers in 44 US States, Boeing officials say that this can be replicated in India. This partnership will create jobs and industrial capacity in India and also helps Boeing stay globally competitive.\nThe future production with Indian partners will involve maximising indigenous content and producing the F/A-18 in India thereby creating a 21st century aerospace ecosystem, Allen said as he refuted giving a direct answer to the question of minimum number of fighter jet orders it needs from India to develop that ecosystem.\n\"We have not framed up our responses to the government's request for information around a minimum order now, but what we've done is that show us your requirements and we'll show you what's possible inside your requirements. But certainly, the government recognises the programmatic constraints that the more it's able invest in a broader program that can cover multiple services, the more capacity for industrial development it will get, he said.\n\"We will shape our bid to the number. There's less we can do at a lower number in terms of what's Made in India. And to get to the full up ecosystem, the more the purchases, the more that can be done. It's a sliding scale. And remember it's also a sliding timescale,\" he said.\nBut at the same time, Allen said that Boeing is not waiting for the competition to begin building the ecosystem.\nBoeing, Allen said will continue to invest millions of dollars in supplier development, training, tooling and quality systems and skill development at its Indian suppliers.\nAllen said Boeing plans to expand its footprint in India from 3,000 engineers to 5,000 in the next couple of years.\n\"We're on our incredible trajectory of that growth. We've also opened up the Apache fuselage manufacturing operation. It's a joint venture - Boeing and Tata that works out of Hyderabad,\" he said.

He gave few details in his opening statement but said the changes would include new ways to evaluate training and self-audits by aerospace companies.\nOver the years, the inspector general's office has found management weaknesses in the agency's oversight, Scovel said.\nIn Seattle, Boeing said the process by which it designs, develops and tests planes has led to safer and safer air travel, and it sees no need for an overhaul.\nThe Max, featuring bigger, more efficient engines and a new automated flight-control system that has now come under suspicion in both air disasters, went into service in 2017.\nTransportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who oversees the FAA, has asked Scovel to look into the way the agency certified the 737 Max as airworthy.\nAt the same time, the Justice Department is investigating possible criminal violations involving the airliner's certification.\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who chaired the hearing, said the \"close relationship between industry and regulators\" threatens to erode the confidence of the flying public. He said commercial aviation is as safe as ever, but reports of lax oversight are frustrating. \"We need to do better, and I believe that we can,\" he said.\nThe Senate Commerce Committee plans another hearing with other witnesses, including Boeing.\nIn his written remarks, acting FAA Administrator Daniel Elwell also hinted at coming changes at the agency but gave few details.\n\"We know that our oversight approach needs to evolve to ensure that the FAA remains the global leader in achieving aviation safety,\" he said.\nElwell also said Boeing submitted an application on January 21 spelling out changes it planned to make to crucial flight-control software on the 737 Max the system suspected of playing a role in the Oct. 29 crash of a Lion Air jet in Indonesia and the March 10 plunge of an Ethiopian Airlines Max. In all, 346 people died.\nAn FAA spokesman said that the Boeing submission was an \"initial application\" and that the agency had not yet received Boeing's completed plan for updating the software.\nThe Transportation Department watchdog has previously raised questions about the FAA's certification of Boeing planes and the seemingly close relationship between some agency managers and Boeing.\nElwell defended collaboration with aircraft makers and airlines, saying that sharing information gives the FAA more knowledge about emerging risks.\nThe process, he said, has \"consistently produced safe aircraft designs for decades.\" The inspector general also plans to examine the widespread use of automated systems to fly airplanes, to look into whether the FAA is making sure airlines are adequately training pilots to handle situations when such features fail, and why the FAA was the last safety regulator in the world to ground the plane after the second crash.\nOther regulators decided \"they needed to drive risk to zero, and they did that by grounding the aircraft,\" Scovel said.\nElwell defended the FAA's decision, as he has before, by saying it acted as soon as \"refined\" tracking data indicated that the flight path of the Ethiopian plane was similar to Lion Air's. Previous data about the Ethiopian flight path, he said, was \"unreliable.\" Multiple investigations into the 737 Max crashes are focusing on the new automated system that can push the plane's nose down to prevent an aerodynamic stall.\nMeanwhile, in Seattle, Boeing's vice president of airplane development, Mike Sinnett, briefed reporters on changes that the company is making to the flight-control system and pilot training. He repeated Boeing's confidence in the safety of the Max.\n\"We are working with customers and regulators around the world to restore faith in our industry and also to reaffirm our commitment to safety and to earning the trust of the flying public,\" Sinnett said.\nBoeing also invited about 200 pilots from several airlines to its Seattle-area facility to explain to them the changes in the Max and \"to get their input and to earn their trust,\" Sinnett said.

giant Boeing pledged Wednesday to do all it can to prevent crashes like the two that killed nearly 350 people in recent months, as it unveiled a fix to the flight software of its grounded 737 MAX aircraft.\nBoeing gathered hundreds of pilots and reporters to unveil the changes to the MCAS stall prevention system, which has been implicated in the tragedies in Ethiopia and Indonesia, as part of a charm offensive to restore the company's reputation.\n\"We are going to do everything to make sure that accidents like this don't happen again,\" Mike Sinnett, Boeing's vice president of product strategy, told reporters at a factory in Washington state.\nMeanwhile, across the country in the nation's capital, the head of the US air safety agency faced harsh questions from senators over its relationship with and oversight of Boeing.\nDan Elwell, the acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration, defended his agency but acknowledged that as systems become more complex, the FAA's \"oversight approach needs to evolve.\" Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and other top officials were also on the hot seat on Capitol Hill.\nBoeing chief Dennis Muilenburg was not called to the Senate hearing, but is expected to testify at a later date.\nAhead of the tough questioning, the company launched a campaign to convince the flying public that it is addressing the issues with the 737 MAX, including a fix to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) implicated in the deadly crashes.\nAt the company's massive factory in Renton, Washington, Boeing unveiled the software changes and offered reassurances.\nSinnett said it will take only about an hour to install the updates and they can begin as soon as regulators authorize the changes, which were developed \"after months of testing and hundreds of hours.\" The MCAS, which makes the aircraft dive in order to regain speed if it detects a stall or loss of airspeed, was developed specifically for the 737 MAX, which has a heavier engine than its predecessor, the 737 NG.\nAmong the changes, the MCAS will no longer repeatedly make corrections when the pilot tries to regain control, and will be automatically disconnected in the event of disagreements between the two \"angle of attack\" (AOA) sensors, the company said.\nThis is a major change because until the Ethiopian Airlines tragedy earlier this month, the MCAS was set to react to information from a single sensor and would repeatedly override pilot corrections.\nThe initial investigation into the Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October found that one of the AOA sensors failed but continued to transmit erroneous information to the MCAS.\nBoeing also will install a warning feature -- at no cost --- called a \"disagree light\" to indicate to the pilot when the left and right AOA sensors are out of sync.\nThe company also is revising pilot training, including for those already certified on the 737, to provide \"enhanced understanding of the 737 MAX\" flight system and crew procedures.\nUS pilots complained after the Lion Air crash that they had not been fully briefed on the system.\nIn Washington, US aviation regulators faced questions about how certification for the MAX was handled.\nLawmakers also want to know why officials did not immediately ground the aircraft after an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX 8 crashed shortly after takeoff near Addis Ababa on March 10, killing all 157 people onboard.\nThe delay has given rise to suspicions of a too-cozy relationship between regulators and the American plane maker, especially since Chinese and European authorities moved quickly to ban the planes as soon as similarities with the Lion Air crash were raised.\nThe FAA -- which delegates some certification procedures to Boeing, including for parts of the MAX -- was \"directly involved\" in the safety review of the MCAS, Elwell said.\n\"The certification process was detailed and thorough,\" but \"time yields more data,\" he added.\nA Boeing official meanwhile said there was no need to revamp a regulatory process that has \"continued to lead to safer and safer airplanes.\" At a separate hearing, Chao said she was \"concerned about any allegations of coziness with any company,\" but noted that allowing Boeing to handle some of its own safety certifications was necessary because the FAA \"can't do it on their own.\" She said she has ordered the Transportation Department's inspector general, Calvin Scovel, to investigate the MAX certification, and Scovel in turn noted various concerns with FAA inspectors and procedures.\nIn his prepared testimony, he called on the agency to tighten oversight of companies that self-certify.\nBut a Boeing official countered that wholesale changes were not needed, saying: \"In general, the process has worked and continues to work, and we see no reason to overhaul the process.

(U.S. Food and Drug Administration) Ohio cat-owners beware \u2014 Nestl\u00e9 Purina PetCare Company has issued a nationwide recall of one of its wet cat food products because the cans could contain rubber. The voluntary recall, announced Friday, applies to a limited amount of Muse wet cat food Natural Chicken Recipe in Gravy. The food comes in three-ounce cans.\nThe recall was \"out of an abundance of caution,\" the U.S. Food and Drug Administration wrote in a recall notice. There have been no reports of cats suffering injuries or falling ill . The company learned of the issue when observant pet parents noticed rubber pieces in the food.\n\"The product could contain rubber pieces that are translucent yellow with a blue backing, which may present a potential choking hazard,\" the recall notice said.\nThe company said it has made changes to its process to avoid any rubber contamination in the future.\n\"We're pet owners and pet lovers too and we only want products that meet our high quality standards in your cat's bowl,\" the company wrote in a Facebook post .\nIt wasn't immediately clear which states received the food, but the products were shipped nationwide and available for purchase at pet specialty and e-commerce retailers.

Sources had told The Straits Times that preliminary checks show that the same cracked blade issue is affecting the new TEN engine as well.\n\"As safety is our top priority, the SIA Group, in consultation with Rolls-Royce, proactively identified other Trent 1000 TEN engines in the Group's 787 fleet to undergo precautionary inspections,\" an SIA statement on Tuesday said. \"All of these engine inspections on SIA's 787-10 fleet have now been completed, and a remaining check will be completed on a Scoot 787-9 by April 3.Pending engine replacements, two SIA 787-10 aircraft have been removed from service.\" NOT SO FAST, BEIJING\nSince taking power in 2016, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has seemed to be in a hurry to realign his nation's treaty relationship with the United States and hew more toward China, in the process even putting aside a favourable ruling from the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague over their conflicting claims in the South China Sea.\nThose who worried that Manila is moving too far, too fast with Beijing can rest a little easy.Philippines Correspondent Raul Dancel says more than 7,500 Philippine and US troops began their largest annual military exercises, amid reports of Chinese encroachments into waters surrounding the largest Philippine-held territory in the disputed South China Sea.\nThis year's Balikatan exercise involves 4,000 Filipino and 3,500 American soldiers. About 50 Australians are also participating.\nAmong the American warships deployed is the USS Wasp, an amphibious assault ship, and its squadron of F-35B stealth fighters, which are being deployed for the first time in the exercise.\nPhilippine nationalism, once defined in terms of anti-Americanism, had turned to anti-Chinese sentiments until Mr Duterte arrived. Noted Columnist Richard Hedarian asks the question: Is the Philippines a 'province' of China? CHINESE STUDENTS IN LIMBO\nDeteriorating strategic ties between the US and China is spreading the hurt beyond trade and into unexpected areas.\nIn May 2018, the Associated Press had reported that the State Department was planning to shorten the validity length of student visas for Chinese students studying a masters or Ph.D. in robotics, aviation and high-end manufacturing. Now, the impact of that policy is showing.\nHundreds of Chinese students in the US who came back home for holiday are stranded , anxiously awaiting the student visa that will allow them to return to study. Since early March, many of them have been organising through a WeChat group in hopes of raising awareness of their plight.\nSome students have already completed their undergraduate studies in China and were working on masters or doctoral degrees in engineering or the sciences in America. Others are studying in the fields of artificial intelligence, aviation, or the material sciences. HUMVEE TIME IN INDIA?\nElections are looming in India and it can be a dangerous game in the world's biggest democracy. In the past, prime ministers have been assassinated, political motorcades ambushed and party officials attacked, and some candidates are not taking any chances.\nIn one Punjab garage it is a busy time for mechanics retrofitting cars with blast-resistant doors and bulletproof windshields . Orders for specialised armoured cars have been piling up at Mr Sunchit Sobti's factory in Jalandhar, where his crew have already retrofitted four SUVs for political bigwigs since the upcoming poll - the biggest election in history - was announced a few weeks ago.\nIt is a pattern that repeats itself every election season, said Mr Sobti, whose father started supplying armoured cars for politicians and other VIP clients in the 1980s when an armed insurgency was raging in Punjab. The market for such cars in India is worth US$150 million a year and growing by double digits, industry representatives said. Companies like Mahindra & Mahindra, and Tata Motors, also offer a small range of pre-made armoured vehicles for civilian use. LEE FAMILY SAGA\nSingapore's Court of Appeal has cleared the way for substantive arguments to be heard in the case against Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's nephew, Li Shengwu , a Harvard don facing charges of contempt of Singapore's court system. The Appeals Court said papers had been properly served on Mr Li.\nIn a Facebook post he put up on July 15, 2017 Mr Li stated in the post that \"the Singapore Government is very litigious and has a pliant court system\". The Attorney-General started contempt proceedings against Mr Li the following month, after he failed to comply with a request to remove the post. Mr Li's appeal against a High Court order that allowed the papers to be served on him in the US was heard in January this year.\nThe post was related to a family dispute involving his father Lee Hsien Yang, his aunt Lee Wei Ling and the Prime Minister over the fate of the Oxley Road home of their late father Lee Kuan Yew, who was Singapore's founding prime minister.\nCommenting on the decision, Mr Li said on his Facebook page: \"I am of course disappointed with the judgment. However, the A-G will still need to prove beyond reasonable doubt that my private Facebook post somehow scandalised Singapore's judiciary.\" IN OTHER DEVELOPMENTS\nNasa has branded India's destruction of one of its satellites a \"terrible thing\" that had created 400 pieces of orbital debris and led to new dangers for astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The Indian satellite was destroyed at a relatively low altitude of 300km, well below the ISS and most satellites in orbit. But 24 of the pieces \"are going above the apogee of the International Space Station\nSingapore has outlined the contours of its legislation to curb online falsehoods with laws that could make offenders face jail terms of up to 10 years . Internet platforms, including social media sites like Facebook, will be required to act swiftly to limit the spread of falsehoods by displaying corrections alongside such posts, or removing them. Failure to comply could fetch fines of up to US$1 million.\nSouth Korea has begun excavating the remains of missing soldiers from the Korean War on the border between the two Koreas, without the involvement of North Korea. The two countries had agreed to start the excavation work together, but no one from North Korea showed up at the agreed site in the eastern part of the demilitarised zone (DMZ), South Korean radio stations reported.\nThailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn has expressed concern over the haze in the country's north , saying that it was beyond the capability of provincial authorities and suggesting that royal volunteers help out, as junta leader Prayut Chan-o-cha flies to Chiang Mai on Tuesday to inspect the damage.Wildfires and crop burning are blanketing the region with smog, prompting Mr Prayut to fly to the area's tourist hot-spot.\nWe'll be back tomorrow, with fresh insights.
