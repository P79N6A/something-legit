Johnson\nWASHINGTON/SEATTLE, April 1 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Monday it planned to submit a proposed software enhancement package for the grounded 737 MAX in \"the coming weeks\" after the company had previously said it planned to deliver the fix for government approval by last week.\nThe company on Monday confirmed a statement from the Federal Aviation Administration that it would submit the upgrade later than previously announced.\nMore than 300 Boeing 737 MAX jets have been grounded worldwide after two crashes - in Indonesia in October and in Ethiopia last month - killed nearly 350 people.\nBoeing, facing one of its worst crises in years, is under pressure from crash victims' families, airlines, lawmakers in Washington and regulators around the world to prove that the automated flight control systems of its 737 MAX aircraft are safe and that pilots have the training required to override the system in an emergency.\nTwo people briefed on the matter said a Boeing review uncovered issues with \"integration\" when the new software is loaded into an aircraft. One of the people added that the issues uncovered had \"nothing to do with Ethiopian.\"\nOne analyst indicated it was too early to determine how much time this would add to the grounding, with approval from non-U.S. regulators still expected to be the main factor in determining when the planes would fly again globally.\nIn a sign the plane may be out of service for longer than some forecast, Southwest Airlines Co said on Monday it was \"publishing a revised schedule for April and May that is built around the currently available Southwest fleet and intends to reduce drastically last-minute trip disruptions and same-day cancellations.\"\nAmerican Airlines Group Inc said it was aware that the resumption of service for its 737 MAX aircraft may be further delayed and said it was working with all customers impacted by any flight cancellations.\nEarlier on Monday, FAA spokesman Greg Martin said that \"time is needed for additional work by Boeing as the result of an ongoing review of the 737 MAX Flight Control System to ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues.\"\nActing FAA Administrator Dan Elwell said last week the agency would not unground the planes until its analysis \"of the facts and technical data indicate that it is appropriate.\"\nOn Monday, the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee sent letters to Boeing and FAA seeking records related to the certification of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.\n\"Understanding where things went wrong is critically important because tragedies like this should not happen,\" said Representative Peter DeFazio, the committee's chair. \"These request letters represent only the start of our investigation and finding answers to our questions will take some time.\"\nDeFazio wants records related to pilot training and communication with international aviation authorities, officials said.\nBoeing said last week that it had reprogrammed software on its 737 MAX passenger jet to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system that is under mounting scrutiny following the two deadly nose-down crashes.\nThe world's largest planemaker said the anti-stall system, which is believed to have repeatedly forced the nose lower in the Indonesia accident, would only do so one time after sensing a problem, giving pilots more control.\nIt would also be disabled if two airflow sensors that measure the \"angle of attack,\" or angle of the wing to the airflow, a fundamental parameter of flight, offered widely different readings, Boeing said last week.\nFederal prosecutors, the Transportation Department's inspector general and U.S. lawmakers are investigating the FAA's certification of the 737 MAX.

REUTERS/Jason Redmond The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) expects Boeing to submit its package of software fixes for the 737 Max airliner \"over the coming weeks.\" The agency said on Monday that it won't approve the software until it's satisfied. Most of the software updates will be to the 737 Max's Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS).

Observers fear Ethiopian Airlines Flight ET302 may have experienced a similar issue. The US Department of Transportation is auditing the Boeing 737 Max 8's FAA certification process. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced on Monday that it expects Boeing to submit the final software fixes for the 737 Max \"over the comings weeks.\" \"The FAA expects to receive Boeing's final package of its software enhancement over the coming weeks for FAA approval,\" the agency said in a statement. \"Time is needed for additional work by Boeing as the result of an ongoing review of the 737 MAX Flight Control System to ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues.\" Once Boeing's submission is complete, FAA is expected to conduct a review of the updated flight-control system. \"The FAA will not approve the software for installation until the agency is satisfied with the submission,\" FAA said. Until then, all 371 Boeing 737 Max airliners already in service will remain grounded. Read more : The Boeing 737 Max is likely to be the last version of the best-selling airliner of all time . Most of the software updates will be to the 737 Max's Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). To fit the Max's larger, more fuel-efficient engines, Boeing had to position the engine farther forward and up. This change disrupted the plane's center of gravity and caused the Max to have a tendency to tip its nose upward during flight, increasing the likelihood of a stall. MCAS is designed to automatically counteract that tendency and point the nose of the plane downward when the plane's angle-of-attack (AOA) sensor triggers a warning. Initial reports from the Lion Air Flight JT610 investigation, however, indicate that a faulty AOA sensor reading may have triggered MCAS shortly after the flight took off.

There are going to be Congressional hearings and both BA and its long-time C-suite executive who is now the acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan will have to manage that.\n10 Tech Stocks That Transformed Their Business For BA, it may mean different protocols in its relationship with the Federal Aviation Administration. The two have become very cozy over the years and lax oversight from the FAA meant that BA seemed to be operating as its own de facto supervisor.\nThis will certainly change.\nAs for Shanahan, who had spent 30 years at BA, he'll be answering to accusations that he was less than objective when it came to certain military contracts between his former employer and competing firms. This won't come back to hurt BA stock, but Shanahan may not get to transition from acting secretary to secretary once this is all over. And BA won't have a former big wig running the Department of Defense.\nAs for the planes and the orders, it's unlikely that BA will lose much business since buying planes isn't like buying cars. They're not sitting somewhere waiting for someone to buy them.\nBottom Line on Boeing Stock Negotiating these deals - especially the big ones - takes time. And delivery takes time. Scrapping a deal when you have already planned on implementing the new planes and cutting another deal with another company to replace them is a very big deal.\nPlus, at this point, it seems this was a software problem that was fixed at the factory but was only offered as an expensive option, rather than made a standard safety upgrade. This is what happens when you nickel and dime safety features in airliners.\nBut the new MAX versions of the 737 will continue to roll off the line and be a huge revenue generator moving forward. Executives at BA and in the federal government will pay a price, but the company will move past this.\nAnd that means this big price drop in Boeing stock is a contrarian dream.\nThat's not to say Boeing stock has bottomed. That may not be the case yet, but the upside is far bigger than its downside at this point.\nMy Portfolio Grader has BA stock rated a B right now, and that makes sense. You may want to wait for this whole current mess to pan out, or you can move in and take some of the turbulence.

Most of the software updates will be to the 737 Max\u2019s Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). Initial reports from the Lion Air Flight JT610 investigation, however, indicate that a faulty angle-of-attack (AOA) sensor reading may have triggered MCAS shortly after the flight took off. Observers fear Ethiopian Airlines Flight ET302 may have experienced a similar issue. The US Department of Transportation is auditing the Boeing 737 Max 8\u2019s FAA certification process.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced on Monday that it expects Boeing to submit the final software fixes for the 737 Max \u201cover the comings weeks.\u201d\n\u201cThe FAA expects to receive Boeing\u2019s final package of its software enhancement over the coming weeks for FAA approval,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cTime is needed for additional work by Boeing as the result of an ongoing review of the 737 MAX Flight Control System to ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues.\u201d\nOnce Boeing\u2019s submission is complete, FAA is expected to conduct a review of the updated flight-control system.\n\u201cThe FAA will not approve the software for installation until the agency is satisfied with the submission,\u201d FAA said.\nUntil then, all 371 Boeing 737 Max airliners already in service will remain grounded.\nRead more : The Boeing 737 Max is likely to be the last version of the best-selling airliner of all time .\nMost of the software updates will be to the 737 Max\u2019s Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS).\nTo fit the Max\u2019s larger, more fuel-efficient engines, Boeing had to position the engine farther forward and up. This change disrupted the plane\u2019s center of gravity and caused the Max to have a tendency to tip its nose upward during flight, increasing the likelihood of a stall. MCAS is designed to automatically counteract that tendency and point the nose of the plane downward when the plane\u2019s angle-of-attack (AOA) sensor triggers a warning.\nInitial reports from the Lion Air Flight JT610 investigation, however, indicate that a faulty AOA sensor reading may have triggered MCAS shortly after the flight took off.

The updates are also geared toward reducing the workload on pilots during emergency situations.\nBoth Boeing and FAA have come under increasing scrutiny over the flight certification of the Boeing 737 Max. On March 19, Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao announced her agency\u2019s intention to audit the 737 Max 8\u2019s FAA certification process.\nLast week, the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Transportation confirmed that it has initiated the audit.

Advertisement Advertisement\nA preliminary report into the second calamity - the Mar 10 crash of a Boeing 737 MAX 8 that killed 157 people - will likely be issued this week, the Ethiopian government said on Monday.\nBoeing last week gathered hundreds of pilots and reporters at its Renton, Washington manufacturing site for a presentation on proposed changes to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which is believed to have been a key factor in the Ethiopian crash and in an October crash of a Lion Air in Indonesia that killed 189 people.\nAmong the changes, the MCAS will no longer repeatedly make corrections when the pilot tries to regain control, and will automatically disconnect in the event of disagreements between the two \"angle of attack,\" or AOA sensors, the company said last week.\nBoeing is anxious to win approval for a proposed remedy that could get the planes back in the air.\nBut the FAA, which faced harsh questioning last week at a congressional hearing regarding its oversight of Boeing, said it expected Boeing to submit the proposed fix \"over the coming weeks\" after it undertakes additional work.\nAfter that, the proposal will be submitted to a \"rigorous safety review,\" the FAA spokesman said.\nPRELIMINARY REPORT THIS WEEK\nEarlier on Monday, Ethiopian foreign ministry spokesman Nebiat Getachew said the transport ministry would release \"a preliminary report into its investigation\" of the Mar 10 accident in which a Nairobi-bound Boeing 737 MAX crashed shortly after taking off from Addis Ababa.\nThe Ethiopian government gave no details on the exact timing of the release, nor hints about the report's findings.\nNebiat initially said the report would be released on Monday but the transport ministry, which is in charge of investigations, later said it would still be some days.\n\"The report will most likely be released some day later this week,\" ministry spokesman Mussie Yiheyes said.\nIt was not clear on Monday if the transport ministry's preliminary report would be made public straight away, or limited to the eyes of authorities including the FAA.\nThe plane's black boxes are being examined by France's BEA air safety agency, working with American and Ethiopian investigators to determine what went wrong.\nANTI-STALL SYSTEM\nA source with knowledge of the investigation has said an anti-stalling system, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), was activated shortly before the crash.\nBoeing designed the automated MCAS system - which lowers the aircraft's nose if it detects a stall or loss of airspeed - for this particular model.\nThe same system was implicated in the October crash, with initial investigations finding that a sensor on the plane had transmitted incorrect information to the MCAS system.\nThe pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 struggled to control the aircraft as the MCAS repeatedly pushed the plane's nose down, according to the flight data recorder.\nThe pilot had tried repeatedly to regain control and pull the nose up but the plane crashed into the sea.\nBoth the planes in Indonesia and Ethiopia reportedly experienced erratic steep climbs and descents, as well as fluctuating airspeeds, before crashing shortly after takeoff.\nEthiopia has already said there were \"clear similarities\" between the two MAX 8 crashes.\nEthiopian Airlines is Africa's largest carrier and in many ways the international face of the nation.

Under gilded ceilings dripping with chandeliers, executives of Airbus SE and the agency that buys planes for China\u2019s airlines signed an order worth Sh3.5 trillion ($35 billion) as French President Emmanuel Macron and his China\u2019s Xi Jinping, looked on. Normally, such an event would be full of gloating. In commercial aviation \u2014 a zero-sum industry with just two global players, Airbus and Boeing Company \u2014 the rivalry is intense and victories are savoured and celebrated.\nSEE ALSO : Airbus to stop A380 superjumbo production But these aren\u2019t normal times, and the ceremony marking Airbus\u2019s biggest deal in several years was unusually muted. Guillaume Faury, soon to be Airbus\u2019s chief executive officer, was subdued, calling the massive order \u201ca sign of confidence between us and our Chinese partners.\u201d Boeing is mired in a painful investigation following two fatal crashes in five months of its popular new 737 Max jet, which has since been grounded worldwide. The catastrophes, which claimed the lives of everyone on board the two planes, have tested the faith in the US Federal Aviation Administration, which certified the jet, and raised a chorus of criticism about Boeing\u2019s slow response. The crisis has shifted the playing field in favour of Airbus at a time that it needs a victory. In February, the company cancelled its A380 double-decker after just a dozen years in service. And its sales force, mired in an investigation into allegations of corruption, has suffered the worst start to the year in at least a decade.\nSEE ALSO : Airbus A380: World\u2019s largest airliner runs out of runway Yet Airbus has made it clear it has no intention of taking advantage of the tragedies, and sales staff were told on a conference call that they shouldn\u2019t mention them in their pitches to customers, according to a person who participated. At the Paris signing, Faury declined to comment on what the Boeing grounding might mean for Airbus. And CEO Tom Enders has stressed that this isn\u2019t the time to go after the wounded rival\u2019s business.\u201cWhen something like that happens, we\u2019re all one big family,\u201d he said at an industry event on March 15. \u201cSafety is not a competition item.\u201d That makes sense, says Michael Hewson, an analyst at CMC Markets, a brokerage in London. For both manufacturers, safety is the bedrock of their business, and without it, they would struggle to make sales. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad look if you try to capitalise on anything like that,\u201d Hewson said.\nSEE ALSO : Airbus can borrow a leaf from matatus on survival \u201cIt\u2019ll come back and bite you.\u201d Some airlines that had bought the single-aisle Boeing have said they will reconsider or even cancel their orders, creating an opening for Airbus to pick up business. On March 28, flag carrier Garuda Indonesia said it planned to call off deliveries of 49 Max 8s, though it said it would most likely buy other Boeing aircraft. Indonesia\u2019s Lion Air, the owner of the plane involved in the first crash, has also hinted that it will scrap a deal to buy almost 200 Boeing 737 Max. So far, it\u2019s been a slow year for Airbus. In January and February, the company booked just four new sales and had 103 cancellations, including a $2.8 billion dollar deal for A320 aircraft that had been destined for now-defunct Germania. Last year the company\u2019s order backlog fell even as its output grew to its highest level ever. \u201cIt was a difficult year for our sales team,\u201d Enders said at the company\u2019s annual results conference in February.\nSEE ALSO : KQ mulls cancelling Boeing order after Ethiopia air crash Against that backdrop, Airbus\u2019s sales force could do with some decisive wins. The windfall in Paris was a nice get but was the fruit of a campaign that had been in the works for more than a year. The task of bringing home additional deals has fallen to Christian Scherer, who took over as chief commercial officer about six months ago after a short-lived stint by Eric Schulz, a company outsider who struggled to adapt to the Airbus culture. Practical limitations During a tour of Asia, Scherer insisted the crashes won\u2019t have any measurable effect on sales and that his firm wouldn\u2019t seek to benefit from them.\u201cBoeing, just like we would do, if they have a solution, a fix to find, they will find it very diligently and very quickly,\u201d Scherer said in a March 19 interview in Taipei. The tragedy with the Boeing jets will have \u201cno bearing\u201d on demand for his aircraft, he said. Beyond the moral restraint keeping Airbus from trying to capitalise on the crisis, the company faces hard practical limitations. For the past several years, fraud agencies in the UK, France, and the US have been looking into allegations of bribery and corruption in the Airbus sales force. The investigations have thrown the sales team and top management into turmoil. At the same time, it\u2019s not easy for carriers to switch manufacturers. Many airlines have made substantial down payments on their orders, which they risk losing if they cancel. Their fleets are often planned around families of jets, allowing them greater flexibility in assigning pilots and maintenance staff. And there are only two manufacturers in the business since a potential Chinese entrant has yet to prove itself. Both of today\u2019s players have order backlogs on their planes that are years long, so any airline that cancels would join the back of the queue at the rival manufacturer. That means the effect of the crashes on either company\u2019s order book won\u2019t be dramatic, says Nick Cunningham, an analyst at Agency Partners, a London equity research firm.

The company said earlier on Monday that it continues to work with the FAA and \"other regulatory agencies worldwide on the certification of the software update and training program.\"\nBoeing said last week that it had reprogrammed software on its 737 MAX passenger jet to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system that is under mounting scrutiny following the two deadly nose-down crashes.\nThe world\u2019s largest planemaker said the anti-stall system, which is believed to have repeatedly forced the nose lower in at least one of the accidents, in Indonesia last October, would only do so one time after sensing a problem, giving pilots more control.\nIt would also be disabled if two airflow sensors that measure the \"angle of attack,\" or angle of the wing to the airflow, a fundamental parameter of flight, offer widely different readings, Boeing said last week.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by G Crosse and Sonya Hepinstall)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.reuters.com"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "davi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shepardson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg martin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "u.s. faa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "boeing", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "southwest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southwest airlines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal aviation administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boeing co", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sao paulo washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T01:18:52.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c2645abf978449fac5f716544324e05a84bc4d5d", "url": "http://globalnews.ca/news/5118884/lirim-harjullahu-hamilton-tiger-cats-returns/", "site_full": "globalnews.ca", "site": "globalnews.ca", "site_section": "http://globalnews.ca/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Hamilton Tiger-Cats kicker Lirim Harjullahu returns for two-year contract", "title_full": "Hamilton Tiger-Cats kicker Lirim Harjullahu returns for two-year contract", "published": "2019-04-02T01:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/ticats1.jpeg?quality=70&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6425, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c2645abf978449fac5f716544324e05a84bc4d5d", "url": "http://globalnews.ca/news/5118884/lirim-harjullahu-hamilton-tiger-cats-returns/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ted Michaels", "published": "2019-04-02T01:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Hamilton Tiger-Cats kicker Lirim Harjullahu returns for two-year contract", "text": "Listen A key component of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats has signed a two-year contract.

The statement comes as the certification process for Boeing's Max jetliners is under intense scrutiny after two accidents that left 346 people dead . Boeing last week proposed software upgrades to the Max aircraft that focused on a flight-control system known as MCAS that is designed to keep the plane's nose from pitching up, which can result in a deadly stall. The system is at issue in the March 10 crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 that slammed into the Java Sea on Oct. 29. Third pilot: Jump-seat pilot reportedly saved Boeing Max jet one day before Lion Air crash \"Time is needed for additional work by Boeing as a result of the ongoing review of the 737 Max Flight Control System to ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues,\" the FAA statement said. \"Upon receipt, the FAA will subject Boeing's completed submission to a rigorous safety review. The FAA will not approve the software for installation until the agency is satisfied with the submission.\" Boeing, which previewed the flight-control changes at its Renton, Washington, facilities, has also said it will mandate more pilot training. #FAA statement on the @Boeing 737 MAX software update. pic.twitter.com/L66M4LcJEJ \u2014 The FAA (@FAANews) April 1, 2019 The FAA statement also comes as an initial report on the Ethiopian crash was expected within days. The two tragedies showed haunting parallels: Both flights experienced drastic speed fluctuations during ascent, and each pilot made a futile attempt to return to the airport a few minutes after takeoff. Ethiopian Airlines CEO Tewolde GebreMariam has said the stall-prevention system, a new feature on the MAX models that debuted in 2017, was activated on his company\u2019s doomed flight. The Max aircraft have been grounded around the world since mid-March and the FAA has been under fire for acting too slowly in parking the planes.

U.S. aviation regulators said Monday, April 1, Boeing needs more time to finish changes in a flight-control system suspected of playing a role in two deadly crashes. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) The Associated Press\nBy DAVID KOENIG, AP Airlines Writer\nBoeing and U.S. aviation regulators say the company needs more time to finish changes in a flight-control system suspected of playing a role in two deadly crashes.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said Monday it anticipates Boeing's final software improvements for 737 Max airliners \"in the coming weeks.\"\nBoeing was expected to complete the work last week, but FAA spokesman Greg Martin said the company needs more time to make sure it has identified and addressed all issues.\nChicago-based Boeing offered the same timetable as it works to convince regulators that it can fix software on the planes.\n\"Safety is our first priority, and we will take a thorough and methodical approach to the development and testing of the update to ensure we take the time to get it right,\" said Boeing spokesman Charles Bickers.\nBoeing needs approval not just from FAA, but elsewhere, including Europe and China, where safety officials have indicated they will conduct their own reviews.\nThe planes have been grounded around the world since mid-March.\nThe news from the FAA suggests that airlines could be forced to park their Max jets longer than they expected. Airlines that own Max jets are scrambling other planes to fill some Max flights while canceling others.\n\"We are aware that the resumption of service for our 737 Max aircraft may be further delayed, and our team will work with all customers impacted by any flight cancellations,\" said American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein.\nAmerican Airlines had been pointing toward a late-April return of its 24 Max 8s. Over the weekend, Southwest Airlines announced that its 34 Max 8s will be removed from the schedule through May instead of mid-April. United Airlines has idled its 14 Max 9s through June 5.\nSeparately, U.S. regulators and Boeing are awaiting a preliminary report from Ethiopian investigators into the March 10 crash of an Ethiopian Airlines Max 8 jet shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa. The report will be scrutinized for information from the plane's data recorders that might suggest similarities between the doomed flight and the Oct. 29 crash of a Lion Air Max 8 into the Java Sea off Indonesia. The two crashes killed 346 people.\nData from the Indonesian plane indicates that pilots unsuccessfully fought the automated anti-stall system for control of the plane, which plunged into the sea shortly after takeoff. According to published reports, the same system activated on the Ethiopian Airlines flight.\nBoeing is making changes in an automated system that is designed to prevent the plane's nose from rising, which can lead to a dangerous aerodynamic stall. The changes include relying on readings from more than one sensor before the anti-stall system activates and pushes the nose down, and making the system's actions less severe and easier for pilots to handle. Boeing has said it will pay to train pilots on the technology.\nTwo American Airlines pilots who attended a session with Boeing experts last week expressed satisfaction with the manufacturer's changes. American's chief 737 pilot, Roddy Guthrie, said Boeing added \"some checks and balances in the system that will make the system much better.\"\nCongress, meanwhile, is looking into the relationship between Boeing and the FAA. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee said Monday that it had requested records from both Boeing and the FAA related to the certification of the 737 Max.\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press .

Aviation Administration said Monday it anticipates Boeing's final software improvements for 737 Max airliners \"in the coming weeks.\"\nBoeing was expected to complete the work last week, but FAA spokesman Greg Martin said the company needs more time to make sure it has identified and addressed all issues.\nChicago-based Boeing offered the same timetable as it works to convince regulators that it can fix software on the planes.\n\"Safety is our first priority, and we will take a thorough and methodical approach to the development and testing of the update to ensure we take the time to get it right,\" said Boeing spokesman Charles Bickers.\nBoeing needs approval not just from FAA, but elsewhere, including Europe and China, where safety officials have indicated they will conduct their own reviews.\nThe planes have been grounded around the world since mid-March. That airline glitch Monday morning hit Southwest Airlines the hardest\nThe news from the FAA suggests that airlines could be forced to park their Max jets longer than they expected. Airlines that own Max jets are scrambling other planes to fill some Max flights while canceling others.\n\"We are aware that the resumption of service for our 737 Max aircraft may be further delayed, and our team will work with all customers impacted by any flight cancellations,\" said American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein.\nAmerican Airlines had been pointing toward a late-April return of its 24 Max 8s. Over the weekend, Southwest Airlines announced that its 34 Max 8s will be removed from the schedule through May instead of mid-April. United Airlines has idled its 14 Max 9s through June 5. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz: Deadly Boeing 737 Max 8 crashes 'have badly shaken consumer confidence'\nSeparately, U.S. regulators and Boeing are awaiting a preliminary report from Ethiopian investigators into the March 10 crash of an Ethiopian Airlines Max 8 jet shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa. The report will be scrutinized for information from the plane's data recorders that might suggest similarities between the doomed flight and the Oct. 29 crash of a Lion Air Max 8 in Indonesia. The two crashes killed 346 people.\nData from the Indonesian plane indicates that pilots unsuccessfully fought the automated anti-stall system for control of the plane, which plunged into the sea shortly after takeoff. According to published reports, the same system activated on the Ethiopian Airlines flight.\nBoeing is making changes in an automated system that is designed to prevent the plane's nose from rising, which can lead to a dangerous aerodynamic stall. The changes include relying on readings from more than one sensor before the anti-stall system activates and pushes the nose down, and making the system's actions less severe and easier for pilots to handle. Boeing has said it will pay to train pilots on the technology.\nTwo American Airlines pilots who attended a session with Boeing experts last week expressed satisfaction with the manufacturer's changes. American's chief 737 pilot, Roddy Guthrie, said Boeing added \"some checks and balances in the system that will make the system much better.\"\nDavid Koenig, The Associated Press", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://dallasnews.activehosted.com/f/embed.php?id=13"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "max", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg martin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "southwest", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "american airlines", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "boeing", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "southwest airlines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal aviation administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T01:49:37.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e41c638019a734ca8d500f9bef7f6a99a82a5e67", "url": "https://www.firstpost.com/business/boeing-to-submit-737-max-software-upgrade-in-the-coming-weeks-6369211.html", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/firstpost/xfJh?utm_source=fp_footer", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "Boeing to submit 737 MAX software upgrade \u2018in the coming weeks\u2019", "title_full": "Boeing to submit 737 MAX software upgrade \u2018in the coming weeks\u2019", "published": "2019-04-02T01:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/reuters/04-2019/02/2019-04-01T203145Z_1_LYNXNPEF302LT_RTROPTP_2_EMBRAER-M-A-BOEING.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e41c638019a734ca8d500f9bef7f6a99a82a5e67", "url": "https://www.firstpost.com/business/boeing-to-submit-737-max-software-upgrade-in-the-coming-weeks-6369211.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Reuters", "published": "2019-04-02T01:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Boeing to submit 737 MAX software upgrade \u2018in the coming weeks\u2019", "text": "Boeing to submit 737 MAX software upgrade 'in the coming weeks' Business 05:45 IST\nBy David Shepardson and Eric M.

Johnson\nWASHINGTON/SEATTLE, April 1 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Monday it planned to submit a proposed software enhancement package for the grounded 737 MAX in \"the coming weeks\" after the company had previously said it planned to deliver the fix for government approval by last week.\nThe company on Monday confirmed a statement from the Federal Aviation Administration that it would submit the upgrade later than previously announced.\n\"We are working to demonstrate that we have identified and appropriately addressed all certification requirements and will be submitting for FAA review once completed in the coming weeks,\" Boeing said. \"We will take a thorough and methodical approach to the development and testing of the update to ensure we take the time to get it right.\"\nMore than 300 Boeing 737 MAX jets have been grounded worldwide after two crashes - in Indonesia in October and in Ethiopia last month - killed nearly 350 people.\nBoeing, facing one of its worst crises in years, is under pressure from crash victims' families, airlines, lawmakers in Washington and regulators around the world to prove that the automated flight control systems of its 737 MAX aircraft are safe and that pilots have the training required to override the system in an emergency.\nTwo people briefed on the matter said a Boeing review uncovered issues with \"integration\" when the new software is loaded into an aircraft. One of the people added that the issues uncovered had \"nothing to do with Ethiopian.\"\nOne analyst indicated it was too early to determine how much time this would add to the grounding, with approval from non-U.S. regulators still expected to be the main factor in determining when the planes would fly again globally.\nIn a sign the plane may be out of service for longer than some forecast, Southwest Airlines Co said on Monday it was \"publishing a revised schedule for April and May that is built around the currently available Southwest fleet and intends to reduce drastically last-minute trip disruptions and same-day cancellations.\"\nAmerican Airlines Group Inc said it was aware that the resumption of service for its 737 MAX aircraft may be further delayed and said it was working with all customers impacted by any flight cancellations.\nEarlier on Monday, FAA spokesman Greg Martin said that \"time is needed for additional work by Boeing as the result of an ongoing review of the 737 MAX Flight Control System to ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues.\"\nActing FAA Administrator Dan Elwell said last week the agency would not unground the planes until its analysis \"of the facts and technical data indicate that it is appropriate.\"\nOn Monday, the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee sent letters to Boeing and FAA seeking records related to the certification of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.\n\u201cUnderstanding where things went wrong is critically important because tragedies like this should not happen,\" said Representative Peter DeFazio, the committee\u2019s chair. \"These request letters represent only the start of our investigation and finding answers to our questions will take some time.\"\nDeFazio wants records related to pilot training and communication with international aviation authorities, officials said.\nBoeing said last week that it had reprogrammed software on its 737 MAX passenger jet to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system that is under mounting scrutiny following the two deadly nose-down crashes.\nThe world's largest planemaker said the anti-stall system, which is believed to have repeatedly forced the nose lower in the Indonesia accident, would only do so one time after sensing a problem, giving pilots more control.\nIt would also be disabled if two airflow sensors that measure the \"angle of attack,\" or angle of the wing to the airflow, a fundamental parameter of flight, offered widely different readings, Boeing said last week.\nFederal prosecutors, the Transportation Department's inspector general and U.S. lawmakers are investigating the FAA's certification of the 737 MAX. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has also said she is naming an outside panel to review the issue. (Reporting by David Shepardson in Washington and Eric M.

(Courtesy of USDA) Georgia cat-owners beware \u2014 Nestl\u00e9 Purina PetCare Company has issued a nationwide recall of one of its wet cat food products because the cans could contain rubber. The voluntary recall, announced Friday, applies to a limited amount of Muse wet cat food Natural Chicken Recipe in Gravy. The food comes in three-ounce cans.\nThe recall was \"out of an abundance of caution,\" the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a recall notice. There have been no reports of cats suffering injuries or falling ill . The company learned of the issue when observant pet parents noticed rubber pieces in the food.\n\"The product could contain rubber pieces that are translucent yellow with a blue backing, which may present a potential choking hazard,\" the recall notice said.\nThe company said it has made changes to its process to avoid any rubber contamination in the future.\n\"We're pet owners and pet lovers too and we only want products that meet our high quality standards in your cat's bowl,\" the company wrote in a Facebook post .\nIt wasn't immediately clear which states received the food, but the products were shipped nationwide and available for purchase at pet specialty and e-commerce retailers. Retailers were asked to remove the affected products, which can be identified by the UPC, production code and \"best by\" date on the bottom of the can. The UPC code is 38100 17199 (single three-ounce can). The \"best by\" date is April 2020 and the production code is 80941162.\nThose who bought a variety pack only have to worry about cans of Natural Chicken Recipe in Gravy.\nCourtesy USDA Patch has reached out to Purina for comment and will update when we hear back.\nPatch national staffer Dan Hampton contributed to this report.\nGet the Kennesaw newsletter", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A//patch.com/georgia/kennesaw/georgia-pet-owners-beware-wet-cat-food-may-contain-rubber&title=Georgia%20Pet%20Owners%20Beware%3A%20Wet%20Cat%20Food%20May%20Contain%20Rubber", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A//patch.com/georgia/kennesaw/georgia-pet-owners-beware-wet-cat-food-may-contain-rubber&t=Georgia%20Pet%20Owners%20Beware%3A%20Wet%20Cat%20Food%20May%20Contain%20Rubber", "https://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm634850.htm", "https://www.facebook.com/purina/posts/10156260284398857", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A//patch.com/georgia/kennesaw/georgia-pet-owners-beware-wet-cat-food-may-contain-rubber", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Georgia%20Pet%20Owners%20Beware%3A%20Wet%20Cat%20Food%20May%20Contain%20Rubber&url=https%3A//patch.com/georgia/kennesaw/georgia-pet-owners-beware-wet-cat-food-may-contain-rubber"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "deb belt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muse", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "purina petcare company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nestl\u00e9 purina petcare company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usda", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kennesaw", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T02:42:19.048+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e964cf4b460f80ce9bd1591a753a3fd5d782b092", "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/faa-expects-boeing-troubled-jet-203710726.html", "site_full": "news.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "http://rss.news.yahoo.com/rss/business\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines", "title": "Boeing, FAA say more time needed for fix of troubled 737 Max", "title_full": "Boeing, FAA say more time needed for fix of troubled 737 Max", "published": "2019-04-02T01:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.FlP0hkfBg5k8PnpYGA6rQ--~B/aD0zMDE2O3c9NDI4NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/d687bef8c0e94e83911c6088d9026cf9.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e964cf4b460f80ce9bd1591a753a3fd5d782b092", "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/faa-expects-boeing-troubled-jet-203710726.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T01:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Boeing, FAA say more time needed for fix of troubled 737 Max", "text": "Boeing, FAA say more time needed for fix of troubled 737 Max DAVID KOENIG Reblog FILE - In this March 14, 2019, file photo, a worker walks next to a Boeing 737 MAX 8 airplane parked at Boeing Field in Seattle. U.S. aviation regulators said Monday, April 1, Boeing needs more time to finish changes in a flight-control system suspected of playing a role in two deadly crashes. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) More Boeing and U.S. aviation regulators say the company needs more time to finish changes in a flight-control system suspected of playing a role in two deadly crashes. The Federal Aviation Administration said Monday it anticipates Boeing's final software improvements for 737 Max airliners \"in the coming weeks.\" Boeing was expected to complete the work last week, but FAA spokesman Greg Martin said the company needs more time to make sure it has identified and addressed all issues. Chicago-based Boeing offered the same timetable as it works to convince regulators that it can fix software on the planes. \"Safety is our first priority, and we will take a thorough and methodical approach to the development and testing of the update to ensure we take the time to get it right,\" said Boeing spokesman Charles Bickers. Boeing needs approval not just from FAA, but elsewhere, including Europe and China, where safety officials have indicated they will conduct their own reviews. The planes have been grounded around the world since mid-March. The news from the FAA suggests that airlines could be forced to park their Max jets longer than they expected. Airlines that own Max jets are scrambling other planes to fill some Max flights while canceling others. \"We are aware that the resumption of service for our 737 Max aircraft may be further delayed, and our team will work with all customers impacted by any flight cancellations,\" said American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein. American Airlines had been pointing toward a late-April return of its 24 Max 8s. Over the weekend, Southwest Airlines announced that its 34 Max 8s will be removed from the schedule through May instead of mid-April. United Airlines has idled its 14 Max 9s through June 5. Separately, U.S. regulators and Boeing are awaiting a preliminary report from Ethiopian investigators into the March 10 crash of an Ethiopian Airlines Max 8 jet shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa. The report will be scrutinized for information from the plane's data recorders that might suggest similarities between the doomed flight and the Oct. 29 crash of a Lion Air Max 8 into the Java Sea off Indonesia. The two crashes killed 346 people. Data from the Indonesian plane indicates that pilots unsuccessfully fought the automated anti-stall system for control of the plane, which plunged into the sea shortly after takeoff. According to published reports, the same system activated on the Ethiopian Airlines flight. Boeing is making changes in an automated system that is designed to prevent the plane's nose from rising, which can lead to a dangerous aerodynamic stall. The changes include relying on readings from more than one sensor before the anti-stall system activates and pushes the nose down, and making the system's actions less severe and easier for pilots to handle. Boeing has said it will pay to train pilots on the technology. Two American Airlines pilots who attended a session with Boeing experts last week expressed satisfaction with the manufacturer's changes. American's chief 737 pilot, Roddy Guthrie, said Boeing added \"some checks and balances in the system that will make the system much better.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "s. warren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg martin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "faa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "max boeing", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "boeing", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "federal aviation administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boeing field", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T02:43:56.043+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ae7c9a751e003346f6ba14b5f5a32d24a1f05a0c", "url": "https://patch.com/georgia/marietta/calendar/event/20190414/350569/sign-up-your-children-to-read-with-good-mews-cats", "site_full": "patch.com", "site": "patch.com", "site_section": "https://patch.com/georgia/marietta/calendar/d/2019-04-08", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Marietta Events Calendar for April 8, 2019 - Marietta, GA Patch", "title": "14 | Sign up your Children to Read with Good Mews Cats!", "title_full": "Apr 14 | Sign up your Children to Read with Good Mews Cats! | Marietta, GA Patch", "published": "2019-04-02T00:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.032, "main_image": "https://cal.patch.com/sites/default/files/styles/t800x600/public/users/23018198/20180522160034/cat.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 465, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ae7c9a751e003346f6ba14b5f5a32d24a1f05a0c", "url": "https://patch.com/georgia/marietta/calendar/event/20190414/350569/sign-up-your-children-to-read-with-good-mews-cats", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jenny Gilmore", "published": "2019-04-02T00:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "14 | Sign up your Children to Read with Good Mews Cats!", "text": "Good Mews Foundation https://goodmews.org/ongoing-events Good Mews Rescue , 3805 Robinson Road, Marietta , GA 30068 By Jenny Gilmore Good Mews is pleased to offer Reading sessions for students in grades 1-8.

Johnson\nWASHINGTON/SEATTLE, April 1 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Monday it planned to submit a proposed software enhancement package for the grounded 737 MAX in \"the coming weeks\" after the company had previously said it planned to deliver the fix for government approval by last week.\nThe company on Monday confirmed a statement from the Federal Aviation Administration that it would submit the upgrade later than previously announced.\n\"We are working to demonstrate that we have identified and appropriately addressed all certification requirements and will be submitting for FAA review once completed in the coming weeks,\" Boeing said. \"We will take a thorough and methodical approach to the development and testing of the update to ensure we take the time to get it right.\"\nMore than 300 Boeing 737 MAX jets have been grounded worldwide after two crashes - in Indonesia in October and in Ethiopia last month - killed nearly 350 people.\nBoeing, facing one of its worst crises in years, is under pressure from crash victims' families, airlines, lawmakers in Washington and regulators around the world to prove that the automated flight control systems of its 737 MAX aircraft are safe and that pilots have the training required to override the system in an emergency.\nTwo people briefed on the matter said a Boeing review uncovered issues with \"integration\" when the new software is loaded into an aircraft. One of the people added that the issues uncovered had \"nothing to do with Ethiopian.\"\nOne analyst indicated it was too early to determine how much time this would add to the grounding, with approval from non-U.S. regulators still expected to be the main factor in determining when the planes would fly again globally.\nIn a sign the plane may be out of service for longer than some forecast, Southwest Airlines Co said on Monday it was \"publishing a revised schedule for April and May that is built around the currently available Southwest fleet and intends to reduce drastically last-minute trip disruptions and same-day cancellations.\"\nAmerican Airlines Group Inc said it was aware that the resumption of service for its 737 MAX aircraft may be further delayed and said it was working with all customers impacted by any flight cancellations.\nEarlier on Monday, FAA spokesman Greg Martin said that \"time is needed for additional work by Boeing as the result of an ongoing review of the 737 MAX Flight Control System to ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues.\"\nActing FAA Administrator Dan Elwell said last week the agency would not unground the planes until its analysis \"of the facts and technical data indicate that it is appropriate.\"\nOn Monday, the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee sent letters to Boeing and FAA seeking records related to the certification of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.\n\u201cUnderstanding where things went wrong is critically important because tragedies like this should not happen,\" said Representative Peter DeFazio, the committee\u2019s chair. \"These request letters represent only the start of our investigation and finding answers to our questions will take some time.\"\nDeFazio wants records related to pilot training and communication with international aviation authorities, officials said.\nBoeing said last week that it had reprogrammed software on its 737 MAX passenger jet to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system that is under mounting scrutiny following the two deadly nose-down crashes.\nThe world's largest planemaker said the anti-stall system, which is believed to have repeatedly forced the nose lower in the Indonesia accident, would only do so one time after sensing a problem, giving pilots more control.\nIt would also be disabled if two airflow sensors that measure the \"angle of attack,\" or angle of the wing to the airflow, a fundamental parameter of flight, offered widely different readings, Boeing said last week.\nFederal prosecutors, the Transportation Department's inspector general and U.S. lawmakers are investigating the FAA's certification of the 737 MAX. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has also said she is naming an outside panel to review the issue. (Reporting by David Shepardson in Washington and Eric M.

said Monday, suggesting the planes could stay grounded a while longer.\nThe Boeing 737 MAX 8, operated by Ethiopian Airlines, crashed on March 10, southeast of Addis Ababa (AFP Photo/TONY KARUMBA)\nAdditional work is needed \u201cto ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues,\u201d a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said in a statement.\n\u201cThe FAA will not approve the software for installation until the agency is satisfied with the submission,\u201d he added.\nThe FAA statement is the bureaucratic equivalent of a \u201cstop\u201d sign after Boeing officials touted their proposed remedy last week during a media tour at the company\u2019s manufacturing plant in Seattle, Washington.\nBoeing\u2019s 737 MAX planes were grounded globally last month following the second of two deadly crashes to occur in less than five months.\nScrutiny has centered on an anti-stall system developed specifically for the planes that has given pilots problems.\nA preliminary report into the second calamity \u2014 the March 10 crash of a Boeing 737 MAX 8 that killed 157 people \u2014 will likely be issued this week, the Ethiopian government said Monday.\nBoeing last week gathered hundreds of pilots and reporters at its Renton, Washington manufacturing site for a presentation on proposed changes to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which is believed to have been a key factor in the Ethiopian crash and in an October crash of a Lion Air in Indonesia that killed 189 people.\nAmong the changes, the MCAS will no longer repeatedly make corrections when the pilot tries to regain control, and will automatically disconnect in the event of disagreements between the two \u201cangle of attack,\u201d or AOA sensors, the company said last week.\nBoeing is anxious to win approval for a proposed remedy that could get the planes back in the air.\nBut the FAA, which faced harsh questioning last week at a congressional hearing regarding its oversight of Boeing, said it expected Boeing to submit the proposed fix \u201cover the coming weeks\u201d after it undertakes additional work.\nAfter that, the proposal will be submitted to a \u201crigorous safety review,\u201d the FAA spokesman said.\nA Boeing spokesman said Monday the company was continuing to work with regulators to address concerns.\n\u201cWe are working to demonstrate that we have identified and appropriately addressed all certification requirements and will be submitting for FAA review once completed in the coming weeks,\u201d the Boeing spokesman said.\n\u201cSafety is our first priority and we will take a thorough and methodical approach to the development and testing of the update to ensure we take the time to get it right.\u201d\nPreliminary report this week\nEarlier Monday, Ethiopian foreign ministry spokesman Nebiat Getachew had said his country\u2019s transport ministry would release \u201ca preliminary report into its investigation\u201d of the March 10 accident in which a Nairobi-bound Boeing 737 MAX crashed shortly after taking off from Addis Ababa.\nThe Ethiopian government gave no details on the exact timing of the release, nor hints about the report\u2019s findings.\nNebiat initially said the report would be released Monday but the transport ministry, which is in charge of investigations, later said this would take several days.\n\u201cThe report will most likely be released some day later this week,\u201d ministry spokesman Mussie Yiheyes said.\nIt was not clear Monday if the transport ministry\u2019s preliminary report would be made public straight away, or limited to the eyes of authorities including the FAA.\nThe plane\u2019s black boxes are being examined by France\u2019s BEA air safety agency, working with American and Ethiopian investigators to determine what went wrong.\nAnti-stall system\nA source with knowledge of the investigation has said an anti-stalling system, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), was activated shortly before the crash.\nBoeing designed the automated MCAS system \u2014 which lowers the aircraft\u2019s nose if it detects a stall or loss of airspeed \u2014 for this particular model.\nThe same system was implicated in the October crash, with initial investigations finding that a sensor on the plane had transmitted incorrect information to the MCAS system.\nThe pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 struggled to control the aircraft as the MCAS repeatedly pushed the plane\u2019s nose down, according to the flight data recorder.\nThe pilot had tried repeatedly to regain control and pull the nose up but the plane crashed into the sea.\nBoth the planes in Indonesia and Ethiopia reportedly experienced erratic steep climbs and descents, as well as fluctuating airspeeds, before crashing shortly after takeoff.\nEthiopia has already said there were \u201cclear similarities\u201d between the two MAX 8 crashes.\nEthiopian Airlines is Africa\u2019s largest carrier and in many ways the international face of the nation.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Airlines that own Max jets are scrambling other planes to fill some Max flights while canceling others.\n\"We are aware that the resumption of service for our 737 Max aircraft may be further delayed, and our team will work with all customers impacted by any flight cancellations,\" said American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein.\nAmerican Airlines had been pointing toward a late-April return of its 24 Max 8s. Over the weekend, Southwest Airlines announced that its 34 Max 8s will be removed from the schedule through May instead of mid-April. United Airlines has idled its 14 Max 9s through June 5.\nSeparately, U.S. regulators and Boeing are awaiting a preliminary report from Ethiopian investigators into the March 10 crash of an Ethiopian Airlines Max 8 jet shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa. The report will be scrutinized for information from the plane&apos;s data recorders that might suggest similarities between the doomed flight and the Oct. 29 crash of a Lion Air Max 8 into the Java Sea off Indonesia. The two crashes killed 346 people.\nData from the Indonesian plane indicates that pilots unsuccessfully fought the automated anti-stall system for control of the plane, which plunged into the sea shortly after takeoff. According to published reports, the same system activated on the Ethiopian Airlines flight.\nBoeing is making changes in an automated system that is designed to prevent the plane&apos;s nose from rising, which can lead to a dangerous aerodynamic stall. The changes include relying on readings from more than one sensor before the anti-stall system activates and pushes the nose down, and making the system&apos;s actions less severe and easier for pilots to handle. Boeing has said it will pay to train pilots on the technology.\nTwo American Airlines pilots who attended a session with Boeing experts last week expressed satisfaction with the manufacturer&apos;s changes. American&apos;s chief 737 pilot, Roddy Guthrie, said Boeing added \"some checks and balances in the system that will make the system much better.\"\nCongress, meanwhile, is looking into the relationship between Boeing and the FAA.

Photo by Stephen Brashear/Getty Images/AFP\u00c2 NEW YORK, USA \u2013 Boeing must perform more work on its proposed fix to 737 MAX aircraft before it can be submitted for review, US officials said Monday, suggesting the planes could stay grounded a while longer. Additional work is needed \"to ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues,\" a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said in a statement. \"The FAA will not approve the software for installation until the agency is satisfied with the submission,\" he added. The FAA statement is the bureaucratic equivalent of a \"stop\" sign after Boeing officials touted their proposed remedy last week during a media tour at the company's manufacturing plant in Seattle, Washington. Boeing's 737 MAX planes were grounded globally last month following the second of two deadly crashes to occur in less than 5 months. Scrutiny has centered on an anti-stall system developed specifically for the planes that has given pilots problems. A preliminary report into the second calamity \u2013 the March 10 crash of a Boeing 737 MAX 8 that killed 157 people \u2013 will likely be issued this week, the Ethiopian government said Monday. Boeing last week gathered hundreds of pilots and reporters at its Renton, Washington manufacturing site for a presentation on proposed changes to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which is believed to have been a key factor in the Ethiopian crash and in an October crash of a Lion Air in Indonesia that killed 189 people. Among the changes, the MCAS will no longer repeatedly make corrections when the pilot tries to regain control, and will automatically disconnect in the event of disagreements between the two \"angle of attack,\" or AOA sensors, the company said last week. Boeing is anxious to win approval for a proposed remedy that could get the planes back in the air. But the FAA, which faced harsh questioning last week at a congressional hearing regarding its oversight of Boeing, said it expected Boeing to submit the proposed fix \"over the coming weeks\" after it undertakes additional work. After that, the proposal will be submitted to a \"rigorous safety review,\" the FAA spokesman said. A source with knowledge of the investigation has said an anti-stalling system , the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), was activated shortly before the crash. Boeing designed the automated MCAS system \u2013 which lowers the aircraft's nose if it detects a stall or loss of airspeed \u2013 for this particular model. The same system was implicated in the October crash, with initial investigations finding that a sensor on the plane had transmitted incorrect information to the MCAS system. The pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 struggled to control the aircraft as the MCAS repeatedly pushed the plane's nose down, according to the flight data recorder. The pilot had tried repeatedly to regain control and pull the nose up but the plane crashed into the sea. Both the planes in Indonesia and Ethiopia reportedly experienced erratic steep climbs and descents, as well as fluctuating airspeeds, before crashing shortly after takeoff. Ethiopia has already said there were \"clear similarities\" between the two MAX 8 crashes. Ethiopian Airlines is Africa's largest carrier and in many ways the international face of the nation. \u2013 Rappler.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stephen brashear/getty images/afp\u00e2", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "us & canada boeing", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "boeing", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "federal aviation administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "renton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T03:46:29.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e49ea869eb9a5c7387177a83d4dba87957c786dc", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-submit-737-max-software-upgrade-coming-weeks-003510925--finance.html", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "http://rss.news.yahoo.com/rss/business\r", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines", "title": "Boeing to submit 737 MAX software upgrade 'in the coming weeks'", "title_full": "Boeing to submit 737 MAX software upgrade 'in the coming weeks'", "published": "2019-04-02T03:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e49ea869eb9a5c7387177a83d4dba87957c786dc", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-submit-737-max-software-upgrade-coming-weeks-003510925--finance.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Boeing to submit 737 MAX software upgrade 'in the coming weeks'", "text": "Boeing to submit 737 MAX software upgrade 'in the coming weeks' By David Shepardson and Eric M.

REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker/File Photo More By David Shepardson and Eric M. Johnson WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Monday it planned to submit a proposed software enhancement package for the grounded 737 MAX in \"the coming weeks\" after the company had previously said it planned to deliver the fix for government approval by last week. The company on Monday confirmed a statement from the Federal Aviation Administration that it would submit the upgrade later than previously announced. \"We are working to demonstrate that we have identified and appropriately addressed all certification requirements and will be submitting for FAA review once completed in the coming weeks,\" Boeing said. \"We will take a thorough and methodical approach to the development and testing of the update to ensure we take the time to get it right.\" More than 300 Boeing 737 MAX jets have been grounded worldwide after two crashes - in Indonesia in October and in Ethiopia last month - killed nearly 350 people. Boeing, facing one of its worst crises in years, is under pressure from crash victims' families, airlines, lawmakers in Washington and regulators around the world to prove that the automated flight control systems of its 737 MAX aircraft are safe and that pilots have the training required to override the system in an emergency. Two people briefed on the matter said a Boeing review uncovered issues with \"integration\" when the new software is loaded into an aircraft. One of the people added that the issues uncovered had \"nothing to do with Ethiopian.\" One analyst indicated it was too early to determine how much time this would add to the grounding, with approval from non-U.S. regulators still expected to be the main factor in determining when the planes would fly again globally. In a sign the plane may be out of service for longer than some forecast, Southwest Airlines Co said on Monday it was \"publishing a revised schedule for April and May that is built around the currently available Southwest fleet and intends to reduce drastically last-minute trip disruptions and same-day cancellations.\" American Airlines Group Inc said it was aware that the resumption of service for its 737 MAX aircraft may be further delayed and said it was working with all customers impacted by any flight cancellations. Earlier on Monday, FAA spokesman Greg Martin said that \"time is needed for additional work by Boeing as the result of an ongoing review of the 737 MAX Flight Control System to ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues.\" Acting FAA Administrator Dan Elwell said last week the agency would not unground the planes until its analysis \"of the facts and technical data indicate that it is appropriate.\" On Monday, the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee sent letters to Boeing and FAA seeking records related to the certification of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. \u201cUnderstanding where things went wrong is critically important because tragedies like this should not happen,\" said Representative Peter DeFazio, the committee\u2019s chair. \"These request letters represent only the start of our investigation and finding answers to our questions will take some time.\" DeFazio wants records related to pilot training and communication with international aviation authorities, officials said. Boeing said last week that it had reprogrammed software on its 737 MAX passenger jet to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system that is under mounting scrutiny following the two deadly nose-down crashes. The world's largest planemaker said the anti-stall system, which is believed to have repeatedly forced the nose lower in the Indonesia accident, would only do so one time after sensing a problem, giving pilots more control. It would also be disabled if two airflow sensors that measure the \"angle of attack,\" or angle of the wing to the airflow, a fundamental parameter of flight, offered widely different readings, Boeing said last week. Federal prosecutors, the Transportation Department's inspector general and U.S. lawmakers are investigating the FAA's certification of the 737 MAX. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has also said she is naming an outside panel to review the issue. (Reporting by David Shepardson in Washington and Eric M.

Photo by EPA-EFE\nApril 1 (UPI) -- An investigative report Monday is expected to shed new light on the crash last month of an Ethiopian Airlines plane that killed 157 people and grounded Boeing's new 737 Max 8 worldwide.\nThe airline will hold a media briefing Monday to address the preliminary report, Foreign Ministry spokesman Nebiat Getachew said. Boeing said it is already reviewing the report. It findings could confirm a theory that the jetliner's anti-stall system malfunctioned -- the same flight system suspected to have caused another Max 8 to crash in Indonesia last fall, killing 189 people.\nOn the plane's cockpit voice recorder, a pilot is heard yelling, \"pitch up, pitch up\" in the moments before the crash -- a possible indication the automated system had forced the aircraft into a dive, the standard maneuver for recovering from a stall. An airplane enters a stall when it no longer has enough speed to generate lift beneath the wings. The best way to recover is to put the plane's nose down, an attempt to pick up speed, and regain lift -- but only as long as there's sufficient altitude to perform the maneuver.\nThe Indonesia crash prompted Boeing to work on a software fix and the company was close to finishing it when the Ethiopian plane went down. Officials said pilots from various airlines are now testing the system in flight simulators. Boeing unveiled the software update last week. RELATED Black box data show faulty sensor caused Ethiopia plane crash\nAs the investigation moves forward, the U.S. Transportation Department is looking into what caused both crashes and how the Federal Aviation Administration certified the plane to fly. The 737 Max 8 entered service in 2017.\nThe FAA said last week will increase oversight by this summer.

The Federal Aviation Administration said Monday it anticipates\u2026\nBoeing and U.S. aviation regulators say the company needs more time to finish changes in a flight-control system suspected of playing a role in two deadly crashes.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said Monday it anticipates Boeing\u2019s final software improvements for 737 Max airliners \u201cin the coming weeks.\u201d\nBoeing was expected to complete the work last week, but FAA spokesman Greg Martin said the company needs more time to make sure it has identified and addressed all issues.\nChicago-based Boeing offered the same timetable as it works to convince regulators that it can fix software on the planes.\n\u201cSafety is our first priority, and we will take a thorough and methodical approach to the development and testing of the update to ensure we take the time to get it right,\u201d said Boeing spokesman Charles Bickers.\nBoeing needs approval not just from FAA, but elsewhere, including Europe and China, where safety officials have indicated they will conduct their own reviews.\nThe planes have been grounded around the world since mid-March.\nThe news from the FAA suggests that airlines could be forced to park their Max jets longer than they expected. Airlines that own Max jets are scrambling other planes to fill some Max flights while canceling others.\n\u201cWe are aware that the resumption of service for our 737 Max aircraft may be further delayed, and our team will work with all customers impacted by any flight cancellations,\u201d said American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein.\nAmerican Airlines had been pointing toward a late-April return of its 24 Max 8s. Over the weekend, Southwest Airlines announced that its 34 Max 8s will be removed from the schedule through May instead of mid-April. United Airlines has idled its 14 Max 9s through June 5.\nSeparately, U.S. regulators and Boeing are awaiting a preliminary report from Ethiopian investigators into the March 10 crash of an Ethiopian Airlines Max 8 jet shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa. The report will be scrutinized for information from the plane\u2019s data recorders that might suggest similarities between the doomed flight and the Oct. 29 crash of a Lion Air Max 8 into the Java Sea off Indonesia. The two crashes killed 346 people.\nData from the Indonesian plane indicates that pilots unsuccessfully fought the automated anti-stall system for control of the plane, which plunged into the sea shortly after takeoff. According to published reports, the same system activated on the Ethiopian Airlines flight.\nBoeing is making changes in an automated system that is designed to prevent the plane\u2019s nose from rising, which can lead to a dangerous aerodynamic stall. The changes include relying on readings from more than one sensor before the anti-stall system activates and pushes the nose down, and making the system\u2019s actions less severe and easier for pilots to handle. Boeing has said it will pay to train pilots on the technology.\nTwo American Airlines pilots who attended a session with Boeing experts last week expressed satisfaction with the manufacturer\u2019s changes. American\u2019s chief 737 pilot, Roddy Guthrie, said Boeing added \u201csome checks and balances in the system that will make the system much better.\u201d\nCongress, meanwhile, is looking into the relationship between Boeing and the FAA. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee said Monday that it had requested records from both Boeing and the FAA related to the certification of the 737 Max.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "s. warren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg martin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "faa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "boeing", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "federal aviation administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boeing field", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T05:30:45.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "914e19d22886b9e734d0f33f4dd1f917bab0d11d", "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/boeing-to-submit-737-max-software-upgrade-in-the-coming-weeks-2016287", "site_full": "www.ndtv.com", "site": "ndtv.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/NDTV-LatestNews", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NDTV News  -  Special", "title": "Boeing To Submit 737 MAX Software Upgrade \"In The Coming Weeks\"", "title_full": "Boeing To Submit 737 MAX Software Upgrade \"In The Coming Weeks\"", "published": "2019-04-02T05:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-03/uof28vro_boeing-737-max-8-reuters_625x300_23_March_19.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 306, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "914e19d22886b9e734d0f33f4dd1f917bab0d11d", "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/boeing-to-submit-737-max-software-upgrade-in-the-coming-weeks-2016287", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T05:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Boeing To Submit 737 MAX Software Upgrade \"In The Coming Weeks\"", "text": "COMMENTS More than 300 Boeing 737 MAX jets have been grounded worldwide.\nBoeing Co said on Monday it planned to submit a proposed software enhancement package for the grounded 737 MAX in \"the coming weeks\" after the company had previously said it planned to deliver the fix for government approval by last week.\nThe company on Monday confirmed a statement from the Federal Aviation Administration that it would submit the upgrade later than previously announced.\n\"We are working to demonstrate that we have identified and appropriately addressed all certification requirements and will be submitting for FAA review once completed in the coming weeks,\" Boeing said. \"We will take a thorough and methodical approach to the development and testing of the update to ensure we take the time to get it right.\"\nMore than 300 Boeing 737 MAX jets have been grounded worldwide after two crashes - in Indonesia in October and in Ethiopia last month - killed nearly 350 people.\nBoeing, facing one of its worst crises in years, is under pressure from crash victims' families, airlines, lawmakers in Washington and regulators around the world to prove that the automated flight control systems of its 737 MAX aircraft are safe and that pilots have the training required to override the system in an emergency.\nTwo people briefed on the matter said a Boeing review uncovered issues with \"integration\" when the new software is loaded into an aircraft. One of the people added that the issues uncovered had \"nothing to do with Ethiopian.\"\nOne analyst indicated it was too early to determine how much time this would add to the grounding, with approval from non-U.S. regulators still expected to be the main factor in determining when the planes would fly again globally.\nIn a sign the plane may be out of service for longer than some forecast, Southwest Airlines Co said on Monday it was \"publishing a revised schedule for April and May that is built around the currently available Southwest fleet and intends to reduce drastically last-minute trip disruptions and same-day cancellations.\"\nAmerican Airlines Group Inc said it was aware that the resumption of service for its 737 MAX aircraft may be further delayed and said it was working with all customers impacted by any flight cancellations.\nEarlier on Monday, FAA spokesman Greg Martin said that \"time is needed for additional work by Boeing as the result of an ongoing review of the 737 MAX Flight Control System to ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues.\"\nActing FAA Administrator Dan Elwell said last week the agency would not unground the planes until its analysis \"of the facts and technical data indicate that it is appropriate.\"\nBoeing said last week that it had reprogrammed software on its 737 MAX passenger jet to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system that is under mounting scrutiny following the two deadly nose-down crashes.\nThe world's largest planemaker said the anti-stall system, which is believed to have repeatedly forced the nose lower in the Indonesia accident, would only do so one time after sensing a problem, giving pilots more control.\nIt would also be disabled if two airflow sensors that measure the \"angle of attack,\" or angle of the wing to the airflow, a fundamental parameter of flight, offered widely different readings, Boeing said last week.\nFederal prosecutors, the Transportation Department's inspector general and U.S. lawmakers are investigating the FAA's certification of the 737 MAX. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has also said she is naming an outside panel to review the issue. (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

submit a proposed software upgrade for the grounded 737 Max in coming weeks, it has said.\nThe aircraft maker on Monday confirmed a statement from the Federal Aviation Administration that it would be late in submitting the upgrade after promising to deliver a fix for government approval by last week.\n\"We are working to demonstrate that we have identified and appropriately addressed all certification requirements and will be submitting it for FAA review once completed in the coming weeks,\" Boeing said.\n\"We will take a thorough and methodical approach to the development and testing of the update to ensure we take the time to get it right.\"\nMore than 300 Boeing 737 Max jets have been grounded worldwide after two crashes \u2013 in Indonesia in October and in Ethiopia last month \u2013 killed nearly 350 people.\nBoeing, facing one of its worst crises in years, is under pressure from victims' families, airlines, US legislators and regulators around the world to prove that the automated flight control systems of its 737 Max aircraft are safe and that pilots have the training required to override them in an emergency.\nSouthwest Airlines said on Monday that it was \"publishing a revised schedule for April and May that is built around the currently available Southwest fleet and intends to reduce drastically last-minute trip disruptions and same-day cancellations\".\nEarlier on Monday, FAA spokesman Greg Martin said: \"Time is needed for additional work by Boeing as the result of an ongoing review of the 737 Max Flight Control System to ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues.\"\nThe authority's acting administrator, Dan Elwell, said last week that the agency would not return the planes to service until its analysis \"of the facts and technical data indicate that it is appropriate\".\nBoeing said last week that it had reprogrammed software on its 737 Max passenger jet to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system that is under increasing scrutiny after the two deadly nose-down crashes.\nThe world\u2019s largest planemaker said the anti-stall system, which is believed to have repeatedly forced the nose lower in at least the Indonesian accident, would only do so one time after sensing a problem, giving pilots more control.\nIt would also be disabled if two airflow sensors that measure the angle of the wing to the airflow, a fundamental parameter of flight, offered widely different readings, Boeing said last week.\nFederal prosecutors, the transport department's inspector general and US legislators are investigating the authority's certification of the 737 Max.\nTransport secretary Elaine Chao said she was naming an outside panel to review the issue.",

The company learned of the issue when observant pet parents noticed rubber pieces in the food.\n\"The product could contain rubber pieces that are translucent yellow with a blue backing, which may present a potential choking hazard,\" the notice said.\nThe company said it has made changes to its process to avoid any rubber contamination in the future. When asked what processes were changed, a spokeswoman for the company only said they implemented additional controls.\n\"We're pet owners and pet lovers too and we only want products that meet our high quality standards in your cat's bowl,\" the company wrote in a Facebook post .\nIt wasn't immediately clear which states received the food, but the products were shipped nationwide and available for purchase at pet specialty and e-commerce retailers. Retailers were asked to remove the affected products, which can be identified by the UPC, production code and \"best by\" date on the bottom of the can. The UPC code is 38100 17199 (single three-ounce can).

Warren, File) More Boeing and U.S. aviation regulators say the company needs more time to finish changes in a flight-control system suspected of playing a role in two deadly crashes.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said Monday it anticipates Boeing's final software improvements for 737 Max airliners \"in the coming weeks.\"\nBoeing was expected to complete the work last week, but FAA spokesman Greg Martin said the company needs more time to make sure it has identified and addressed all issues.\nChicago-based Boeing offered the same timetable as it works to convince regulators that it can fix software on the planes.\n\"Safety is our first priority, and we will take a thorough and methodical approach to the development and testing of the update to ensure we take the time to get it right,\" said Boeing spokesman Charles Bickers.\nBoeing needs approval not just from FAA, but elsewhere, including Europe and China, where safety officials have indicated they will conduct their own reviews.\nThe planes have been grounded around the world since mid-March.\nThe news from the FAA suggests that airlines could be forced to park their Max jets longer than they expected. Airlines that own Max jets are scrambling other planes to fill some Max flights while canceling others.\n\"We are aware that the resumption of service for our 737 Max aircraft may be further delayed, and our team will work with all customers impacted by any flight cancellations,\" said American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein.\nAmerican Airlines had been pointing toward a late-April return of its 24 Max 8s. Over the weekend, Southwest Airlines announced that its 34 Max 8s will be removed from the schedule through May instead of mid-April. United Airlines has idled its 14 Max 9s through June 5.\nSeparately, U.S. regulators and Boeing are awaiting a preliminary report from Ethiopian investigators into the March 10 crash of an Ethiopian Airlines Max 8 jet shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa. The report will be scrutinized for information from the plane's data recorders that might suggest similarities between the doomed flight and the Oct. 29 crash of a Lion Air Max 8 into the Java Sea off Indonesia. The two crashes killed 346 people.\nData from the Indonesian plane indicates that pilots unsuccessfully fought the automated anti-stall system for control of the plane, which plunged into the sea shortly after takeoff. According to published reports, the same system activated on the Ethiopian Airlines flight.\nBoeing is making changes in an automated system that is designed to prevent the plane's nose from rising, which can lead to a dangerous aerodynamic stall. The changes include relying on readings from more than one sensor before the anti-stall system activates and pushes the nose down, and making the system's actions less severe and easier for pilots to handle. Boeing has said it will pay to train pilots on the technology.\nTwo American Airlines pilots who attended a session with Boeing experts last week expressed satisfaction with the manufacturer's changes. American's chief 737 pilot, Roddy Guthrie, said Boeing added \"some checks and balances in the system that will make the system much better.\"\nCongress, meanwhile, is looking into the relationship between Boeing and the FAA.

Jason Redmond, Reuters/File NEW YORK--Boeing must perform more work on a proposed fix to its 737 MAX aircraft before it can be submitted for review, US officials said Monday, suggesting the planes could stay grounded a while longer.\nAdditional work is needed \"to ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues,\" a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said in a statement.\n\"The FAA will not approve the software for installation until the agency is satisfied with the submission,\" he added.\nThe FAA statement is the bureaucratic equivalent of a \"stop\" sign after Boeing officials touted their proposed remedy last week during a media tour at the company's manufacturing plant in Seattle, Washington.\nBoeing's 737 MAX planes were grounded globally last month following the second of two deadly crashes to occur in less than five months.\nScrutiny has centered on an anti-stall system developed specifically for the planes that has given pilots problems.\nA preliminary report into the second calamity -- the March 10 crash of a Boeing 737 MAX 8 that killed 157 people -- will likely be issued this week, the Ethiopian government said Monday.\nBoeing last week gathered hundreds of pilots and reporters at its Renton, Washington manufacturing site for a presentation on proposed changes to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which is believed to have been a key factor in the Ethiopian crash and in an October crash of a Lion Air in Indonesia that killed 189 people.\nAmong the changes, the MCAS will no longer repeatedly make corrections when the pilot tries to regain control, and will automatically disconnect in the event of disagreements between the two \"angle of attack,\" or AOA sensors, the company said last week.\nBoeing is anxious to win approval for a proposed remedy that could get the planes back in the air.\nBut the FAA, which faced harsh questioning last week at a congressional hearing regarding its oversight of Boeing, said it expected Boeing to submit the proposed fix \"over the coming weeks\" after it undertakes additional work.\nAfter that, the proposal will be submitted to a \"rigorous safety review,\" the FAA spokesman said.\nA Boeing spokesman said Monday the company was continuing to work with regulators to address concerns.\n\"We are working to demonstrate that we have identified and appropriately addressed all certification requirements and will be submitting for FAA review once completed in the coming weeks,\" the Boeing spokesman said.\n\"Safety is our first priority and we will take a thorough and methodical approach to the development and testing of the update to ensure we take the time to get it right.\"\nPRELIMINARY REPORT THIS WEEK\nEarlier Monday, Ethiopian foreign ministry spokesman Nebiat Getachew had said his country's transport ministry would release \"a preliminary report into its investigation\" of the March 10 accident in which a Nairobi-bound Boeing 737 MAX crashed shortly after taking off from Addis Ababa.\nThe Ethiopian government gave no details on the exact timing of the release, nor hints about the report's findings.\nNebiat initially said the report would be released Monday but the transport ministry, which is in charge of investigations, later said this would take several days.\n\"The report will most likely be released some day later this week,\" ministry spokesman Mussie Yiheyes said.\nIt was not clear Monday if the transport ministry's preliminary report would be made public straight away, or limited to the eyes of authorities including the FAA.\nThe plane's black boxes are being examined by France's BEA air safety agency, working with American and Ethiopian investigators to determine what went wrong.\nANTI-STALL SYSTEM\nA source with knowledge of the investigation has said an anti-stalling system, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), was activated shortly before the crash.\nBoeing designed the automated MCAS system -- which lowers the aircraft's nose if it detects a stall or loss of airspeed -- for this particular model.\nThe same system was implicated in the October crash, with initial investigations finding that a sensor on the plane had transmitted incorrect information to the MCAS system.\nThe pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 struggled to control the aircraft as the MCAS repeatedly pushed the plane's nose down, according to the flight data recorder.\nThe pilot had tried repeatedly to regain control and pull the nose up but the plane crashed into the sea.\nBoth the planes in Indonesia and Ethiopia reportedly experienced erratic steep climbs and descents, as well as fluctuating airspeeds, before crashing shortly after takeoff.\nEthiopia has already said there were \"clear similarities\" between the two MAX 8 crashes.\nEthiopian Airlines is Africa's largest carrier and in many ways the international face of the nation.\nShare\nSave

likely nominee for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board, has supporters in the White House who are able to look past his earlier financial and legal troubles, a senior administration official told The Wall Street Journal Monday.\nThere are two vacancies on the seven-member board, and last month, President Trump said he planned on picking Moore, a conservative commentator, for one of the seats. Since then, it's been reported that Moore owes the IRS $75,000; a judge found him in contempt of court for not paying his ex-wife spousal and child support; and he was fired from The Wall Street Journal 's editorial board due to his questionable choices in speaking engagements. The White House continues to stand behind him, the official said, and nothing that has come out has changed anyone's opinion.\nLast week, Moore's wife, Anne Carey, explained the $75,000 debt to the IRS as a filing error on his 2014 taxes involving a deduction for both alimony and child support payments; Moore was only allowed to deduct alimony. Over the weekend, The Guardian obtained court records showing that in November 2012, Moore was found in contempt of court for not paying his ex-wife $300,000 in spousal and child support and divorce settlement payments. In 2013, a judge ordered Moore to sell his house in Virginia to pay off the debt, but his ex-wife stopped this after he paid her two-thirds of what was owed.\nMoore joined the Journal 's editorial board in 2005, leaving in 2014 after a dispute with editorial page director Paul Gigot, people familiar with the matter told the Journal . Writers for the editorial page are prohibited from getting paid for speaking to nonprofit organizations, and Gigot became uneasy with some of Moore's speaking engagements, feeling they were entering partisan territory. \"I told him he had to make a choice between politics and journalism,\" Gigot told the Journal .

( Ruth Fremson / The New York Times ) \u201cOur pilots are trained to deal with any of these issues,\u201d United Continental Holdings Inc. Chief Executive Oscar Munoz said at a March 7 aviation event in Washington. \u201cJust fly the darn airplane\u2014that\u2019s what they\u2019re taught.\u201d\nThree days later, a 737 MAX flown by United code-share partner Ethiopian Airlines nose-dived into the ground after six minutes aloft, an eerie replay of Indonesia\u2019s Lion Air crash.\nMuch remains unknown about Boeing\u2019s internal response during the roughly five-month window between the two crashes. But recent congressional testimony, as well as interviews with executives, regulators and others suggest the American aviation industry had an overly U.S.-centric view about how to handle safety issues, and often a dismissive view of overseas pilots.\n After the first crash, a top Boeing official told a gathering of U.S. pilots they wouldn\u2019t encounter similar problems, contending they were better trained than their counterparts in other countries, according to a person familiar with the meeting.\nAnd the company was slow in coming up with a fix to the system identified as a major factor in the two crashes, according to people briefed on the details. Even though Boeing said engineers had been exploring a software patch since November, disagreements between Boeing and its regulator about a host of issues relating to the 737 MAX\u2019s operation hampered progress, according to a person briefed on the details. The patch is still not ready and may not be for weeks.\nThe twin tragedies have spawned a series of investigations into whether Boeing and its regulator acted with sufficient urgency between the two crashes to address the 737 MAX\u2019s design problems.\nAs early as this week, officials are expected to release early findings in their probe of the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. The preliminary report, according to people familiar with the details, is expected to illustrate similarities with the Lion Air crash, including activation of the same suspect system, known as MCAS, triggered by faulty data from a sensor.\nA Boeing spokesman said Monday the company is continuing to work with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and other world regulators on the software changes and related training. \u201cSafety is our first priority, and we will take a thorough and methodical approach to the development and testing of the update to ensure we take the time to get it right,\u201d the spokesman said.\nThe crisis brings into sharp relief a major vulnerability for Boeing: As the Chicago-based plane maker increasingly depends on business from emerging markets hungry for air travel, it must focus on safeguards not only aimed at U.S. aviators but also engineer planes with automated systems that new, relatively inexperienced pilots around the world can safely operate.\nBefore both crashes, a senior Boeing executive in an interview exemplified the company\u2019s thinking, when he talked about the emergence of less-experienced pilots and how \u201cyou need something up there that is going to help them manage complexity and to maintain our record of safety.\u201d\n Once viewed around the globe as the gold standard for airline safety regulation, the FAA has seen its authority challenged in the wake of the crashes. Foreign regulators have taken unilateral action in grounding the Boeing jets, while U.S. regulators and aviation policy makers have questioned whether the agency delegated too much oversight authority to the company.\nEven as Boeing\u2019s safety arguments started unraveling and a host of national aviation authorities grounded the planes, acting FAA chief Daniel Elwell stayed in lockstep with the manufacturer.\nThe decision to delay groundings, Mr. Elwell told a Senate subcommittee last week, reflected his conversations with U.S. pilot union heads. \u201cTo a person,\u201d he testified, they told him \u201cwe are absolutely confident in the safety of this aircraft, and our pilots\u2019 level of training in flying it.\u201d\nOn Monday, the FAA suggested it could take weeks more for final approval \u201cto ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues.\u201d The agency added it won\u2019t give its final signoff until it is fully satisfied with Boeing\u2019s submission.\nBoeing launched the redesign of the 737, the best selling jet in its history, in the face of intensifying competition from its European rival Airbus. In adding larger, fuel-efficient engines, Boeing had to tweak the plane\u2019s design and add the MCAS system to prevent potential stalls created by the revised placement of the engines. The idea was to make the 737 MAX handle like its predecessors, part of a goal to minimize additional training costs for airlines buying the new plane, which made its debut in 2017.\nBoeing pulled in orders totaling more than $50 billion, helping drive its stock price to a record high by early 2019. The company can take some comfort in the performance of the new flight-control software in the U.S. The FAA and airlines say there hasn\u2019t been a single incident of MCAS misfiring in the roughly some 50,000 737 MAX flights through March.\nDays after Lion Air Flight 610 crashed, the company and the FAA maintained the 737 MAX model was perfectly safe, so long as pilots precisely followed emergency procedures on which they\u2019ve been trained. U.S. airlines and their pilot unions vouched for the plane and their ability to safely fly it. In November, responding to preliminary investigative findings, Boeing issued a lengthy statement drawing attention to possible maintenance deficiencies and pilot error.\nLion Air expressed frustration with Boeing and raised the prospect of canceling its remaining MAX deliveries. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed with the way Boeing has behaved,\u201d Lion Air co-founder Rusdi Kirana said in an interview at the time. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame your operator,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are partners\u2014we are not enemies.\u201d\nPublicly, Boeing continued to market the new aircraft and tout its new deals with customers. The company delivered around 125 of the jets to airlines and leasing companies between the Lion Air crash and the global grounding ultimately put in place March 13, pushing the fleet above 370. Most have gone to overseas carriers.\nInside Boeing, though, a group of engineers had been working on fixing suspected MCAS shortcomings since early November, according to Boeing.\nBy late that month, Boeing was facing blowback from its domestic constituents. Some pilot unions were sharply critical of the manufacturer for excluding mention of the stall-prevention system in 737 MAX manuals and training.\nOn Nov. 27, Boeing sent a delegation of four senior members of the company\u2019s engineering, flight, government relations, and sales teams, to speak with American Airlines\u2019 pilots union. The group included Mike Sinnett, vice president of product strategy, Allan Smolinski, sales director for the Americas, and John Moloney, director of transportation policy. The meeting was the first of its kind, according to the union.\nBoeing officials told the pilots that Boeing had to design planes to accommodate pilots with different levels of experience and wanted to avoid inundating pilots with too much information. They said many airlines around the world didn\u2019t want to take on additional training that extra indicators and alerts could require, a union official who attended the meeting recalled.\nIn another meeting in Washington around the same time, Mr. Sinnett told the Air Line Pilots Association that U.S. crews wouldn\u2019t encounter similar problems, suggesting they tend to be better trained and often more disciplined in following emergency procedures, than overseas pilots, according to a person who attended the session.\nThat analysis rang true with many U.S. aviators, who note that economics and demographics dictate that commercial pilots in many overseas markets, especially fast-growing aviation regions in Asia and Africa, on average have significantly less flight experience than their U.S. counterparts.\nStill, Boeing officials told both unions that a MAX software fix was in the works, putting the completion date in mid-January, according to people present at the meetings.\nThat target turned out to be optimistic. Differences of opinion between Boeing and its regulator created complications. There were disagreements over whether mandatory cockpit alerts should be added to help pilots recognize a potential MCAS misfire, and a spectrum of opinion on whether the design needed to accommodate two sensors to measure the angle of the plane\u2019s nose, according to one person briefed on the details. The planes came equipped with two sensors but only one fed into MCAS at any given time.\nBoeing initially was cool to switching to twin sensors and proposed fewer training requirements than the FAA preferred, according to people briefed on the details.\nTwo U.S. carriers, American and Southwest Airlines Co. , had already added some of the safety features under discussion, such as an alert that would signal when two sensors disagree. American, whose planes have had these features for years, also had displays to show the specific sensor measurements. Southwest opted to add that feature after the Lion Air crash. But these features cost around $50,000 to add, according to government documents, and many budget airlines overseas didn\u2019t incorporate them.\nAs recently as early March, the FAA and Boeing were still arguing over how much training pilots should receive in the new system, according to people briefed on the talks. The FAA ultimately prevailed in its insistence that pilots receive interactive training on laptops and other devices.\nA day after the Ethiopian crash, Boeing publicly announced the final details of its planned software update that went beyond what many industry officials familiar with the discussions had anticipated.\nOn March 12, the following day, Boeing and FAA experts flew the initial flight to test the redesigned flight controls.\nThe changes to the stall-prevention system that automatically pushes down a plane\u2019s nose and can override manual pilot commands, mark a major shift from how Boeing originally designed the feature in the aircraft. The goal of the fix now is to make the system, known as MCAS, less powerful, more controllable by pilots and unable to misfire if it receives incorrect data from a sensor. Earlier proposals envisioned far fewer changes, according to one person briefed on the process.\nIn the wake of the Ethiopian crash, Boeing accelerated work on the update given the added urgency, according to two senior industry officials briefed on the plane maker\u2019s response. Boeing assured customers, one of the officials said, the company is throwing \u201cevery possible resource\u201d at fixing the MAX.\nA Boeing official who outlined the timetable to reporters last week said the Ethiopian accident didn\u2019t figure into the schedule for creating, testing and rolling out the fix.\nHe said that engineers, working with regulators and suppliers, were careful not to rush the fix through rounds of deployment, testing and tweaking before more testing as the changes evolved. \u201cAs we got into it, we realized that there were other ways that we could make the system even more robust than the initial changes we had in mind,\u201d he said. \u201cIt took until now because we wanted to get it right.\u201d\nWrite to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com, Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com and Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.com\nCorrections & Amplifications A photo that appeared with an earlier version of this article showed a 737 MAX plane and a Boeing 737-800 being assembled at Boeing\u2019s facility in Renton, Wash.

It was released in 1977 and in 2009, VH1 named it the 32nd best rock song of all time. But, we digress. No matter how much you love your cat(s), if they are tearing up your furniture, it\u2019s time to find a solution. We\u2019re here to help.\nDo all cats scratch furniture? Scratching is a normal aspect of cat behavior. In the wild, cats scratch their claws to remove the dead layer of claw (think of it like a cat manicure), which helps to keep their claws sharp for hunting. Scratching also lets them mark their territory. They have scent glands between their claws and the scratch marks themselves are a visual sign to other cats that this area is occupied. Scratching and stretching also help them to keep their bodies in good shape.\nSo, your much-loved cat is simply being a cat. However, it\u2019s not fun if they decide to leave their calling card on your furniture, drapes or carpets. So here are some proven ways to keep a cat from scratching furniture.\nDon\u2019t declaw your cat Declawing your cat is not recommended. It\u2019s a surgical procedure that involves removing the last bone in each of your cat\u2019s toes to prevent the claws from regrowing . It can lead to behavior problems such as biting and refusal to use a litter box. Scratching isn\u2019t the only unusual behavior cats sometimes display\u2014find out why cats knead .\nProvide scratching posts Kittens begin to scratch at around eight weeks old, so start training your cat when it\u2019s young by providing scratching posts or stands. Your cat can still indulge in its natural behavior, but without shredding your furniture. And, here\u2019s more awesome DIY cat furniture to entertain your cat.\nUse cat scratch spray Using a cat scratch spray will trick your cat into thinking that it has already marked its territory, discouraging it from scratching where you don\u2019t want it to. You can purchase a spray to stop cats from scratching furniture , but it\u2019s easy to make your own homemade cat scratching spray using vinegar, essential citrus oils, or even garlic and peppermint! And if you\u2019re trying to keep your cat off your kitchen countertop, here are 10 ways to do it.\nUse cat scratch tape If you\u2019re wondering how to stop cats from scratching leather furniture, then cat scratch tape is the answer. It also works well on fabric, carpet and hard surfaces such as walls and doors. This double-sided sticky tape comes in panels or rolls like regular tape, and can be stuck where you need it and removed easily afterward. Cats hate the feeling of stickiness on their paws, so it discourages scratching. Find out more about signs your cat is mad at you .\nTry socks or nail caps Cat socks (aka mittens) to prevent scratching are an alternative to declawing. These socks work well for some cats, but if yours gets frustrated and keeps removing them, try soft nail caps that glue onto your cat\u2019s claws. These will limit the damage if your cat does decide to scratch where it shouldn\u2019t.\nProtect with vinyl guards Yet another option is to install clear vinyl panels on your furniture where your cat wants to scratch. These panels are available in many sizes and they come with screw pins that make the panels very easy to install.\nSo, while you might not be able to keep your cat from scratching furniture altogether, these tips can reduce the likelihood of damage to your home.\nCan\u2019t remember Cat Scratch Fever ? You\u2019re welcome. And, if you\u2019re still wondering why your cat behaves in a certain way, then look no further than these things your kitty would really love to tell you .\nOriginally Published on sitename.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07J1L7XXN", "https://www.familyhandyman.com/diy-advice/11-awesome-diy-cat-furniture-ideas/", "https://www.familyhandyman.com/smart-homeowner/top-10-diy-ways-to-keep-a-cat-off-the-kitchen-countertop/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fit99l6kHyA", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00EG8LIN0", "https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/common-cat-behavior-issues/destructive-scratching", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00074W44E", "https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/declawing-cats-far-worse-manicure", "https://placehold.it/32x22", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00XYUJIHY", "https://www.mom4real.com/homemade-cat-deterrent-spray-stop-scratching-accidents/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07N2LMX7H"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ted nugent", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vh1", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T08:35:36.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "33924dd8c18bb369e74991b731ec919bed941f76", "url": "https://www.gocomics.com/how-to-cat/2019/04/02", "site_full": "www.gocomics.com", "site": "gocomics.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "comic_books"], "section_title": "", "title": "How to Cat by Lucas Turnbloom for April 02, 2019 - GoComics", "title_full": "How to Cat by Lucas Turnbloom for April 02, 2019 - GoComics", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.462, "main_image": "https://assets.amuniversal.com/96801d60321401378d60005056a9545d", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2083, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 6, "comments": 1, "shares": 12}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "33924dd8c18bb369e74991b731ec919bed941f76", "url": "https://www.gocomics.com/how-to-cat/2019/04/02", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to Cat by Lucas Turnbloom for April 02, 2019 - GoComics", "text": "How to Cat by Lucas Turnbloom for April 02, 2019 April 01, 2019 2019.

Officers found two other people trying to restrain Miller. Miller then bit both of those people, the charges state.\nMiller was taken to a hospital where investigators learned he had allegedly \"consumed an unknown amount of LSD.\" When he \"eventually became coherent enough for an interview,\" Miller admitted to punching, strangling and slamming his cat against a wall, according to charging documents.\nCourt documents do not say if Miller was charged in 2017 or why charges are being filed now.\nMore recently, Miller was charged with felony drug- and weapons-related crimes and obstructing justice.\nOn Sept. 27, Anthony Child, 26, was shot in a trailer at the Lakeview Estates, 2600 N. Hill Field Road in Layton. But rather than go to a local hospital, he made his friends drive him to a hospital in Preston, Idaho, allegedly to hide the marijuana and psychedelic mushroom growing operation in the trailer, according to police.\nChild died shortly after arriving at the hospital.

Image: A row of grounded Boeing MAX 8 aircraft that were destined for China\nAnd so the spotlight shone brighter and hotter as people tried to work out what on earth was going on.\nThe department of justice opened a criminal inquiry.\nThere are multiple congressional and department of transport investigations in to how the FAA certified Boeing's 737 MAX.\nWas it too cosy with Boeing? Did it outsource too much of the certification process to Boeing itself, putting as one senator expressed it, \"the fox in charge of the hen house\"?\nGlobal regulators have said they won't take the FAA's word for it when they re-certify the aircraft, instead conducting their own full, independent process.\nThis is a departure from the norm in a world where the FAA has long been considered the gold standard, and it may not have happened had the regulator been quicker off the mark.\nNow, as the world awaits the preliminary accident report from the recent Ethiopian Airlines crash, Boeing continues to refuse to supply spokespeople and executives for interviews. The aviation firm says it is trying to restore faith in the industry and that it is committed to regaining public trust.\nThere have been plenty of helpful background briefings, numerous vague written statements, and one earnest recorded message to camera from its CEO.\nBut in an age where customers expect a flow of information and authentic real time responses, Boeing keeps missing its chance to communicate with the flying public in a pro-active and courageous way.\nA number of employees from prominent aviation companies have told me of their frustration about this silent and secretive approach.\nAnd so in the vacuum of its own making, every nut and bolt of Boeing's process is being raked over. Image: Boeing insisted the plane was safe, before grounding them to apply software updates\nA law suit has been filed by the family of a victim of the Ethiopian Airlines crash.\nIt alleges that Boeing made errors on its initial safety assessment of the MAX.\nIt says that the \"accident occurred because, among other things, Boeing defectively designed a new flight control system for the Boeing 737 MAX 8 that automatically and erroneously pushes the aircraft's nose down, and because Boeing failed to warn of the defect.\"\nBoeing denies this.\nBut there is an awful lot on the line for the world's largest commercial plane manufacturer, and its counterparts at the FAA. Image: There is an awful lot on the line for the world\u2019s largest commercial plane manufacturer\nI'm pleased, if you can use that word in such awful circumstances, that they failed to get their response right.\nThat failure resulted in real scrutiny of the way the MAX was made, and how it came to be in our skies.\nIt resulted in people thinking again about the safety of a transport mode that we take utterly for granted.\nIt may also result in accountability.\nAnd for the flying public, that's a very, very good thing.

These aircraft are configured with 337 seats in two classes, featuring 36 Business Class seats and 301 Economy Class seats.\nSeparately, SIA's regional arm, SilkAir, has also been affected by the grounding of its Boeing 737 Max 8.\nThe planes have been on the tarmac since March 12, as part of a global precautionary measure, following two crashes involving the aircraft type.\nThis article was first published in The Straits Times .

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) David Koenig, The Associated Press Published Monday, April 1, 2019 7:14PM EDT Last Updated Monday, April 1, 2019 8:50PM EDT\nBoeing and U.S. aviation regulators say the company needs more time to finish changes in a flight-control system suspected of playing a role in two deadly crashes.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said Monday it anticipates Boeing's final software improvements for 737 Max airliners \"in the coming weeks.\"\nBoeing was expected to complete the work last week, but FAA spokesman Greg Martin said the company needs more time to make sure it has identified and addressed all issues.\nChicago-based Boeing offered the same timetable as it works to convince regulators that it can fix software on the planes.\n\"Safety is our first priority, and we will take a thorough and methodical approach to the development and testing of the update to ensure we take the time to get it right,\" said Boeing spokesman Charles Bickers.\nBoeing needs approval not just from FAA, but elsewhere, including Europe and China, where safety officials have indicated they will conduct their own reviews.\nThe planes have been grounded around the world since mid-March.\nThe news from the FAA suggests that airlines could be forced to park their Max jets longer than they expected. Airlines that own Max jets are scrambling other planes to fill some Max flights while cancelling others.\n\"We are aware that the resumption of service for our 737 Max aircraft may be further delayed, and our team will work with all customers impacted by any flight cancellations,\" said American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein.\nAmerican Airlines had been pointing toward a late-April return of its 24 Max 8s. Over the weekend, Southwest Airlines announced that its 34 Max 8s will be removed from the schedule through May instead of mid-April. United Airlines has idled its 14 Max 9s through June 5.\nSeparately, U.S. regulators and Boeing are awaiting a preliminary report from Ethiopian investigators into the March 10 crash of an Ethiopian Airlines Max 8 jet shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa. The report will be scrutinized for information from the plane's data recorders that might suggest similarities between the doomed flight and the Oct. 29 crash of a Lion Air Max 8 into the Java Sea off Indonesia. The two crashes killed 346 people.\nData from the Indonesian plane indicates that pilots unsuccessfully fought the automated anti-stall system for control of the plane, which plunged into the sea shortly after takeoff. According to published reports, the same system activated on the Ethiopian Airlines flight.\nBoeing is making changes in an automated system that is designed to prevent the plane's nose from rising, which can lead to a dangerous aerodynamic stall. The changes include relying on readings from more than one sensor before the anti-stall system activates and pushes the nose down, and making the system's actions less severe and easier for pilots to handle. Boeing has said it will pay to train pilots on the technology.\nTwo American Airlines pilots who attended a session with Boeing experts last week expressed satisfaction with the manufacturer's changes. American's chief 737 pilot, Roddy Guthrie, said Boeing added \"some checks and balances in the system that will make the system much better.\"\nCongress, meanwhile, is looking into the relationship between Boeing and the FAA. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee said Monday that it had requested records from both Boeing and the FAA related to the certification of the 737 Max.
