(AP Photo/Alan Diaz, File) By The Associated Press SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apr 1, 2019 6:47 PM facebook twitter mail\nA Northern California jury ordered Chevron Corp. to pay the families of two brothers who died of cancer a combined $21.4 million after concluding the company failed to properly warn the men about the dangers of a toxic solvent they worked with at a company-owned tire factory.\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported that the Contra Costa County jury's verdict Friday came after three days of deliberations and four weeks of trial.\nThe jury concluded that the solvent benzene caused the cancers that killed brothers Gary Eaves and Randy Eaves. The brothers worked at a tire manufacturer in Arkansas owned by Unocal for decades. San Ramon, California-based Chevron purchased Unocal in 2005. Both brothers at times worked as a \"spray booth operator\" responsible for spraying the solvent on tires.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Chevron (CVX), IBM (IBM) and Medtronic (MDT). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\nChevron \u2019s shares have gained +9.7% in the past year, outperforming the Zacks Integrated Oil industry's +3.4% increase as its financial results have greatly improved over the period. In fact, Chevron's free cash flow and upstream production for 2018 hit a record.\nThe Zacks analyst thinks the company\u2019s existing oil and gas development project pipeline is among the best in the industry, targeting a CAGR of 3-4% through 2023 thanks to the planned expansion in the Permian Basin. Moreover, growing free cash flow should enable Chevron to deliver stable and rising dividend in the foreseeable future.\nHowever, there are worries of a drop in its downstream earnings that have been cutting into overall gains from rising E&P income. The massive capex might also play a spoilsport. Hence, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point before buying shares in Chevron.\n(You can read the full research report on Chevron here >>> ).\nShares of IBM have outperformed the broader market on a year-to-date basis, increasing +24.2% vs. the S&P 500\u2019s +13.1% gain. IBM provides advanced information technology solutions, including computer systems, software, storage systems and microelectronics.\nThe Zacks analyst thinks IBM\u2019s improving position in hosted cloud, security and analytics bodes well for investors. The RedHat acquisition, aimed at enhancing its hybrid cloud platform, is likely to pave the way for IBM's growth prospects. However, softness in Systems revenues and technology & cloud platforms remain a concern.\nStiff competition does not bode well for the Storage hardware segment. Strategic imperatives will take some more time to report meaningful growth and offset weakness in the traditional business. IBM\u2019s ongoing heavily time-consuming business model transition to cloud is a headwind. Additionally, ballooning debt levels have been troubling IBM over time.\n(You can read the full research report on IBM here >>> ).\nMedtronic \u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Products industry in the past year, gaining +17.5% vs. +15.5%. The Zacks analyst thinks Medtronic is successfully registering sustainable growth across major groups and regions, in addition to displaying successful achievement of synergy targets.\nThe company is focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses. This apart, the company has been seeing certain favorable developments in its Diabetes business. The updated 2019 guidance with raised EPS view increases investors\u2019 confidence on the stock.\nMeanwhile, the recently-closed acquisition of Mazor Robotics, which is expected to fortify Medtronic's position in spine surgery, is a major positive. Yet, the declining CRHF segment raises concerns. Escalating costs and expenses continue to weigh on Medtronic\u2019s bottom line.\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), lululemon (LULU) and Carnival (CCL).\nZacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2019\nIn addition to the stocks discussed above, wouldn't you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-holds for the year?\nFrom more than 4,000 companies covered by the Zacks Rank, these 10 were picked by a process that consistently beats the market. Even during 2018 while the market dropped -5.2%, our Top 10s were up well into double-digits. And during bullish 2012 \u2013 2017, they soared far above the market's +126.3%, reaching +181.9%.\nThis year, the portfolio features a player that thrives on volatility, an AI comer, and a dynamic tech company that helps doctors deliver better patient outcomes at lower costs.\nMark VickerySenior Editor\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.
