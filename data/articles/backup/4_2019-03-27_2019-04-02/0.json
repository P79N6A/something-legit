Everyone knows it has been in the doldrums for many years, but with recession fears brewing, and rates falling, the outlook is an interesting one. Goldman Sachs thinks gold is headed higher. Their thesis is that late cycle worries and falling rates will combine to push up the shiny metal. Falling rates will weaken the Dollar, further helping overseas buyers purchase gold.\nFINSUM : In general, we like this thesis. However, we think gold would do better if there was more worry about a huge downturn/crisis, which there doesn't seem to be. Fears right now are about a standard recession, which would help gold, but maybe not be ultra bullish. gold Goldman Sachs silver The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.

Let\u2019s break it down.\nInstagram announces Checkout on Instagram. This lets users on the popular, image-based social media platform buy items without leaving the app. They just tap a product from a shoppable image and check out, using stored payment information. Shopping from Instagram can be a convoluted process as customers needed to access items from a truncated shopping page, go to the brand\u2019s website or use a third-party solution that forced admirers to \u201clike\u201d a product before receiving any information about it, or instructions on how to buy.\nCheckout is in beta right now, but there\u2019s a long list of brands participating including Adidas, Burberry, ColourPop Cosmetics, H&M, Nike and Warby Parker, to name just a few. It\u2019s a pretty good bet that consumers will be very receptive.\nSearch engines are getting smart with photos . Google has introduced shoppable image ads for the 2018 holiday season, claiming that one-third of shoppers searched for images before heading to a store the year before.\nPinterest picks up Walmart\u2019s top techie . Jeremy King is joining the platform as head of engineering. King was previously the chief technology officer at Walmart and knows a thing or two about building out digital commerce.\nJeremy will lead the team at Pinterest responsible for powering the visual discovery engine that delivers recommendations to the more than 250 million users, according to the company . Recent Pinterest engineering projects include applying computer vision to automate Shop the Look and new shopping features such as catalogs, shopping ads and personalized shopping recommendations.\nEfforts to streamline commerce at Pinterest are picking up steam.\nPinterest now lets retailers upload entire catalogs. This taps into consumers\u2019 trust in images over textual information and increases. According to the company, the more products in the system, the higher they are in the relevance rankings.\nPinterest has long be a favorite site for planning projects ranging from home remodels to weddings and birthdays. It sits at an interesting intersection in that it ranks the highest among social media platforms in terms of consumer trust, according to the Intent Lab, a partnership between digital agency Performics and Northwestern University\u2019s Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications.\nThe platform also has the highest score among social media brands in what Performics calls the Digital Satisfaction Index (DSI). Additionally, image-based social media platforms (Pinterest, Instagram and Snapchat) all tend to have higher DSI scores than platforms that are not image-based (Facebook and Twitter).\nPair this with another Intent Lab study that shows how important images are in commerce . Some 59% of shoppers think visual information is more important than written information, especially in categories such as apparel and home furnishings which rank the highest with roughly 85% of shoppers placing more trust in images than words. The message comes across loud and clear: Consumers trust a photograph more than a product description or review.\nCollectively, 41% of consumers find visual information very helpful when making product comparisons throughout the shopper journey which encompasses what marketers call the exploring, evaluating and buying phases, according to the Intent Lab. Visual information is preferred over text by at least 50% of respondents although it\u2019s slightly less popular in the electronics and wine and spirits categories, likely because product specs and descriptions matter more for these items.\nThis trust in visual platforms and images could well be a brand\u2019s best defense against Amazon.\nThe e-commerce giant has long used user reviews as a linchpin around which its business is built. Consumers are as likely to access Amazon from a competitive retail store to read reviews as they are to compare prices. But increasingly the validity of these reviews is being questioned, handicapping sites that have come to rely on them to provide a competitive advantage.\nHome Improvement is ready for its close up. Home Depot has begun using image recognition online and in stores, to great effect. Representative for the retailer discussed it a Shoptalk and Ted Mann, CEO of Slyce, said separately that he was \u201csuper bullish on the topic of home improvement \u201cfor one simple reason: parts and fasteners and bulbs (really, anything you would get at Home Depot) are really tough to describe and have the vocabulary for. Visual search makes it dead simple to look up any of these items.\u201d\nSlyce, a visual search and recognition company has been working with Home Depot for over five years \u201cand visual search now makes up a meaningful percentage of their overall mobile search volume. Being in their app, we've seen millions of user-generated photos of parts, which has helped our models become three times as accurate as Amazon's visual search, and twice as accurate as Samsung Bixby and Pinterest.\u201d\nHome Depot is even applying the power of images to in-store searches. According to Mann, \u201cthe overwhelming majority (more than 70%) of searches for Home Depot take place inside their physical retail stores \u2014 often at the hand of store associates. So much so that they began working with us to build a kiosk that lives in the fastener aisle and can automatically detect any part that's placed onto it.\u201d\nFor all of us who pull a broken part out of something at home and wander up and down the aisles of a mammoth home improvement store, wondering what it\u2019s called much less where a new one is located, this technology is a game changer.\n\u201cIt's even more precise than the mobile experience, because in the kiosk environment, we can detect fine-grain measurements, finish, etc.,\u201d Mann said. And another good weapon in the arsenal against Amazon.\nA game changer for grocery. Image recognition could also really help traditional grocers make the leap to online. Grocery as a category has been slow to take off online and legacy retailers in this space are scrambling to implement digital tools to compete with Amazon following its acquisition of Whole Foods Market. Letting consumers build lists from pictures \u2013 either through visual search of image capture and recognition, is far more compelling than forcing a textual search of endless scrolling through categories to find the exact brand and size or struggle with various bar code scanners.\nIn this case, pictures really are worth a thousand words.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.marketingdive.com/news/visual-search-seen-as-more-trustworthy-than-other-online-content-study-fin/547672/", "https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/catalogs-shopping", "https://searchengineland.com/google-debuts-shoppable-image-ads-video-in-shopping-showcase-ads-305360", "https://www.performics.com/introducing-checkout-on-instagram/", "https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/pinterest-hires-former-walmart-cto-as-head-of-engineering", "https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/automating-shop-the-look-on-pinterest-a17aeff0eae2"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "home depot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pinterest", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T00:28:22.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "05fb3efc9df922599840e26745b53d512dd207c3", "url": "https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/cramer-nasdaq-goldman-sachs-amazon-223035749.html", "site_full": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo Finance - Business finance, stock market, quotes, news", "title": "Cramer: Nasdaq, Goldman Sachs, and Amazon are de-risked IPO plays", "title_full": "Cramer: Nasdaq, Goldman Sachs, and Amazon are de-risked IPO plays", "published": "2019-04-02T03:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "05fb3efc9df922599840e26745b53d512dd207c3", "url": "https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/cramer-nasdaq-goldman-sachs-amazon-223035749.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tyler Clifford", "published": "2019-04-02T03:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cramer: Nasdaq, Goldman Sachs, and Amazon are de-risked IPO plays", "text": "CNBC's Jim Cramer said he did not expect Lyft shares to get hit so hard on Monday after their after a positive Friday debut on the stock market.\nThe rideshare app traded as high as $88 a share in its first day, but tumbled nearly 12 percent to settle at $69.01 on Monday. With a load of highly-anticipated companies planning to go public in 2019, he said it's a sign that investors must be very careful buying red-hot initial public offerings. Those include names such as Pinterest, Uber, and Airbnb.\nBut there is a way to make money on the IPO frenzy without buying the new stocks, Cramer said.\n\"If you want to play the IPO boom without taking the immense risk of buying these stocks right out of the gate, embrace the indirect approach and buy the more consistent winners here like Nasdaq, Goldman Sachs and Amazon,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\nInvest in the exchanges Cramer said investors can buy the stock exchanges that will list the oncoming IPOs. The usual suspects on the U.S. market are the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, he said.\n\"Given where most of these deals are coming, I think Nasdaq's stock is the way to go,\" Cramer said.\nLevi Strauss went public less than two weeks ago on the NYSE, but was the only new name to list on that market in the first quarter. The Nasdaq brought 17 deals, including Lyft, to market in the first three months of the year, he noted.\nAdditionally, Lyft was the Nasdaq's largest IPO since the faulty debut of Facebook on the tech-focused exchange in 2012. At the time, Facebook's stumble worried many tech companies, which pushed notable names such as Twitter, Alibaba, and Snap Inc. to list on the NYSE, Cramer said.\nUber and Pinterest have also opted for the NYSE, but the host thinks the Nasdaq is in position to land big deals in the future.\n\"Nasdaq delivered 11 percent organic revenue growth, double digit, in its latest quarter. That's a nice acceleration and 21 percent earnings growth,\" Cramer said. \"Plus, with Nasdaq's stock trading at less than 16 times next year's earnings estimates, I think it's a bargain.\"\nUnderwriters The investment banks that underwrite an IPO are well compensated, Cramer said. Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan handled the Levi's and Lyft offerings, respectively, and both firms will play a role in Pinterest's listing this year, he noted.\n\"Goldman Sachs is a pure-play investment bank ... their underwriting business is much more of a needle-mover than JP Morgan,\" he said. \"They win a bunch of these deals and it will really bolster their earnings power ... The IPO boom could be the catalyst that finally gets this, the cheapest on a price-to-earnings multiple brokerage stock that there is, [moving].\"\nUber is going through its public offering process with Morgan Stanley, which should be a \"lucrative\" deal for the bank, Cramer said.\n\"Again, the financials are an unloved group, but these IPOs give you a reason to bet on the investment banks,\" he said.\nAmazon Amazon doesn't have direct exposure to the IPO market, but there is a high chance that its cloud segment does business with the company that's filing, Cramer said.\nSnap Inc. had $1 billion worth of business with Amazon Web Services at its initial offering, the host said. In Lyft's case, the ride-hailing company will pay the Amazon's cloud arm $300 million over the next three years, he said. While Pinterest is set to pay the company $750 million over a six-year period through 2023, he added.\n\"Amazon Web Services dominates this business. Their next largest competitors, [Alphabet subsidiary] Google and Microsoft, don't even come close,\" Cramer said. \"So as we see this parade of tech IPOs ... it's telling us how much \u2014 each one of them seems to have a deal with Amazon.\"\nAWS revenue grew 47 percent in 2018.\nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

With a load of highly-anticipated companies planning to go public in 2019, he said it's a sign that investors must be very careful buying red-hot initial public offerings. Those include names such as Pinterest, Uber, and Airbnb.\nBut there is a way to make money on the IPO frenzy without buying the new stocks, Cramer said.\n\"If you want to play the IPO boom without taking the immense risk of buying these stocks right out of the gate, embrace the indirect approach and buy the more consistent winners here like Nasdaq, Goldman Sachs and Amazon ,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\nInvest in the exchanges Cramer said investors can buy the stock exchanges that will list the oncoming IPOs. The usual suspects on the U.S. market are the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, he said.\n\"Given where most of these deals are coming, I think Nasdaq 's stock is the way to go,\" Cramer said.\nLevi Strauss went public less than two weeks ago on the NYSE , but was the only new name to list on that market in the first quarter. The Nasdaq brought 17 deals, including Lyft, to market in the first three months of the year, he noted.\nAdditionally, Lyft was the Nasdaq's largest IPO since the faulty debut of Facebook on the tech-focused exchange in 2012. At the time, Facebook's stumble worried many tech companies, which pushed notable names such as Twitter , Alibaba , and Snap Inc. to list on the NYSE, Cramer said.\nUber and Pinterest have also opted for the NYSE, but the host thinks the Nasdaq is in position to land big deals in the future.\n\"Nasdaq delivered 11 percent organic revenue growth, double digit, in its latest quarter. That's a nice acceleration and 21 percent earnings growth,\" Cramer said. \"Plus, with Nasdaq's stock trading at less than 16 times next year's earnings estimates, I think it's a bargain.\"\nUnderwriters The investment banks that underwrite an IPO are well compensated, Cramer said. Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan handled the Levi's and Lyft offerings, respectively, and both firms will play a role in Pinterest's listing this year, he noted.\n\"Goldman Sachs is a pure-play investment bank ... their underwriting business is much more of a needle-mover than JP Morgan ,\" he said. \"They win a bunch of these deals and it will really bolster their earnings power ... The IPO boom could be the catalyst that finally gets this, the cheapest on a price-to-earnings multiple brokerage stock that there is, [moving].\"\nUber is going through its public offering process with Morgan Stanley , which should be a \"lucrative\" deal for the bank, Cramer said.\n\"Again, the financials are an unloved group, but these IPOs give you a reason to bet on the investment banks,\" he said.\nAmazon Amazon doesn't have direct exposure to the IPO market, but there is a high chance that its cloud segment does business with the company that's filing, Cramer said.\nSnap Inc. had $1 billion worth of business with Amazon Web Services at its initial offering, the host said. In Lyft's case, the ride-hailing company will pay the Amazon's cloud arm $300 million over the next three years, he said. While Pinterest is set to pay the company $750 million over a six-year period through 2023, he added.\n\"Amazon Web Services dominates this business. Their next largest competitors, [ Alphabet subsidiary] Google and Microsoft , don't even come close,\" Cramer said. \"So as we see this parade of tech IPOs ... it's telling us how much \u2014 each one of them seems to have a deal with Amazon.\"\nAWS revenue grew 47 percent in 2018.\nWATCH: Cramer explains how investors can make money on IPO season through the side door show chapters Cramer: Nasdaq, Goldman Sachs, and Amazon are de-risked IPO plays 7:00 PM ET Mon, 1 April 2019 | 10:12 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, and JP Morgan.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://instagram.com/jimcramer", "https://twitter.com/MadMoneyOnCNBC", "https://www.facebook.com/madmoney?ref=aymt_homepage_panel", "https://twitter.com/jimcramer"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cramer", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jim cramer", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ipo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pinterest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "airbnb", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T02:27:23.063+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c470d1e247f6a7f1f3b7fedfd8b213cca549870b", "url": "https://www.dealsplus.com/Home-Garden_deals/p_monte-carlo-fans-up-to-37-off", "site_full": "www.dealsplus.com", "site": "dealsplus.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/dealspl/all", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "DealsPlus: all deals", "title": "Monte Carlo Fans - Up to 37% Off $68.33 (homedepot.com)", "title_full": "Monte Carlo Fans - Up to 37% Off $68.33 (homedepot.com)", "published": "2019-04-02T01:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.dealspluscdn.com/ai/0x0/dealimage/20000/7996000/7996030_1554154116.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5159, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c470d1e247f6a7f1f3b7fedfd8b213cca549870b", "url": "https://www.dealsplus.com/Home-Garden_deals/p_monte-carlo-fans-up-to-37-off", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T01:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Monte Carlo Fans - Up to 37% Off $68.33 (homedepot.com)", "text": "Low prices on well rated fans.

UK Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would fall by 5.5 percent and the subsequent drop of global confidence in the nation would further depreciate UK Currency by 17 percent.\nSome sort of transition deal secured between the parties would reverse part of the United Kingdom 's economic losses and the UK GDP would grow by 1.75 percent and the currency would appreciate by 6 percent.\nIf the United Kingdom were to stay as part of the economic trade bloc with the European Union , the country would be able to completely recoup its losses, increase its global confidence in its businesses and the currency would appreciate by 10 percent.\nUK lawmakers are set to continue discussing alternative Brexit options on Monday after holding a series of indicative votes on Wednesday.\nThe European Council gave the United Kingdom an extension beyond the original Brexit deadline of March 29. The UK Parliament now has to come up with a new Brexit proposal, following the rejection of UK Prime Minister Theresa May 's Brexit deal, by April 12 or risks leaving the bloc without a deal.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "goldman sachs uk", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "goldman sachs faizan hashmi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "urdupoint news / sputnik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T22:00:07.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "56e5e7035bc1f587ebe7797434239ab845ae82ff", "url": "https://hip2save.com/2019/04/02/up-to-40-off-husky-garage-storage-cabinets-at-home-depot/", "site_full": "hip2save.com", "site": "hip2save.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping"], "section_title": "", "title": "Up to 40% Off Husky Garage Storage Cabinets at Home Depot - Hip2Save", "title_full": "Up to 40% Off Husky Garage Storage Cabinets at Home Depot - Hip2Save", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://hip2save.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Husky-Garage-Storage.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6284, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "56e5e7035bc1f587ebe7797434239ab845ae82ff", "url": "https://hip2save.com/2019/04/02/up-to-40-off-husky-garage-storage-cabinets-at-home-depot/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Up to 40% Off Husky Garage Storage Cabinets at Home Depot - Hip2Save", "text": "\nOrganize the garage!

Yet for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the furor surrounding money it raised for a Malaysian state investment fund refuses to go away. The fund, known as 1MDB, is at the center of a global scandal involving claims of embezzlement and money laundering that triggered investigations in the U.S., Singapore, Switzerland and beyond. At least three senior current or former Goldman executives were implicated in the first charges against individuals by U.S. prosecutors. And in the first criminal charges against Goldman since it got embroiled in the scandal, Malaysia is seeking fines in excess of $3.3 billion. 1. What exactly did Goldman do? The New York-based bank advised 1MDB on the acquisitions of Tanjong Energy Holdings, from Malaysian billionaire Ananda Krishnan, and domestic power plants from Genting Bhd -- financed by two separate bond offerings in 2012 worth $3.5 billion. In 2013, 1MDB issued an additional $3 billion in debt underwritten by Goldman to raise capital for \u201cnew strategic economic initiatives\u201d with Abu Dhabi. (Those potential initiatives were to include a financial center built on 70 acres of prime Kuala Lumpur real estate and named for the father of then-Prime Minister Najib Razak, who is now facing dozens of corruption charges related to 1MDB. Najib denies wrongdoing.) For its work on the bonds, Goldman earned almost $600 million in fees. 2. What\u2019s the problem with that? Goldman\u2019s lead banker for the bond sales, Tim Leissner, has confessed to U.S. law enforcement that he bribed officials to get Goldman hired for the bonds deals, and that he and others arranged the fundraising as debt offerings because that would generate higher fees for the bank. Leissner\u2019s deputy, Roger Ng, and Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho -- the central figure in the scandal, according to U.S. prosecutors, who\u2019s commonly referred to as Jho Low -- were charged with conspiring to launder billions of dollars embezzled from 1MDB. Malaysian and U.S. investigators are probing earlier deals carried out by Leissner in the country, according to Malaysia\u2019s leader-in-waiting, Anwar Ibrahim. Two Abu Dhabi investment funds are also suing Goldman, claiming they suffered losses from the bank\u2019s \u201ccentral role\u201d in the case. 3. What about the criminal charges? Malaysia alleges that Goldman misrepresented to investors that the proceeds would be used for legitimate purposes, when the bank knew that the funds would be misappropriated, according to Malaysia Attorney General Tommy Thomas. Related charges were also filed against Leissner and Ng. Goldman will \u201cvigorously defend\u201d against the charges, spokesman Edward Naylor said in an email, calling the charges \u201cmisdirected.\u201d 4. How high might this go? Prosecutors assert that beyond Leissner, who left the bank in February 2016, a number of employees at Goldman knew about a bribery scheme but worked to hide it from the firm\u2019s compliance and legal departments. While nobody has accused him of wrongdoing, Lloyd Blankfein, until recently Goldman\u2019s chief executive officer, held a meeting in 2012 that was attended by Jho Low, the bank said in a statement. Blankfein \u201cdoes not recall any one-on-one meeting with Mr. Low nor have we seen any record to suggest such a meeting occurred,\u201d Goldman said. 5. What\u2019s at stake for Goldman? Beyond any damage to its reputation, money. Attorney General Thomas said Malaysia will seek fines well in excess of both the $2.7 billion of allegedly misappropriated funds and the $600 million in fees received by Goldman for the 1MDB deals. Malaysia Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad had previously said he wanted to recoup some of the 1MDB funds and Goldman\u2019s fees, which exceeded what banks typically make from government deals. The bank\u2019s revenue from the 1MDB deals amounted to about 7.7 percent of the face value of the securities. Underwriters collected average fees of 1.32 percent in 2013 on comparable deals, according to Bloomberg data. 6. What is Goldman\u2019s position? Goldman officials have said for years that the bank raised money for 1MDB without knowing that it would be diverted from the development projects. The bank had been telling U.S. prosecutors it was deceived by Leissner during the deals with 1MDB, people familiar with the matter said. In a quarterly filing in early November, Goldman said it could face \u201csignificant fines\u201d as a result of the U.S. investigation. As for the fees and commissions, Goldman said in 2015 that they \u201creflected the underwriting risks\u201d it had assumed. 7. What happened to the 1MDB money? The U.S. Department of Justice alleges Low and 1MDB officials diverted more than 40 percent of the net amount raised in the 2012 bond sales, or $1.4 billion, to a Swiss bank account belonging to a British Virgin Islands entity, and about $1.3 billion from the 2013 bond sales to accounts whose beneficial owner was an associate of Low\u2019s. 1MDB -- full name, 1Malaysia Development Bhd. -- took shape in 2009 under Najib as a vehicle to drive investment into Malaysia and boost the country\u2019s assets overseas. In all, it raised more than $8 billion via bond sales.

Our thinking is driven by three factors- continued weakness in economic activity, still benign inflation and soft global growth, and a dovish Fed,\" Goldman Sachs said in a report.\nIt expects inflation to remain below the RBIs medium term target until the end of 2019.\nThe brokerage expects some pick-up in growth over the course of this year, and forecast real GDP growth to increase from 7.1 percent in FY19 to 7.5 percent in FY20.\nHeadline CPI inflation rose to 2.6 percent in February, reversing a declining trend since July 2018.\nThe report lowered its inflation forecasts and now see average headline CPI inflation at 3.4 percent in FY19 compared to 3.6 percent before.\nIt expects some pick-up in food inflation over the course of the year as favourable base effects begin to wane and\nmomentum builds as indicated by the recent prints on consumer and wholesale prices.\n\"Based on our outlook for food, partly offset by lower commodity prices, and a stable core, we forecast average headline inflation to rise from 3.4 percent in FY19 to 4 percent in FY20,\" it said.\nThe brokerage had earlier expected no change in the policy rate in the April meeting.\nIt, however, said a decision to hold rates steady at the April meeting remains a significant possibility.\n\"Should policymakers continue to be in a wait and watch mode to gauge the progress on transmission of the past rate cut in February, they may choose to loosen later rather than sooner,\" the report said.\nThe brokerage expects another rate cut by the RBI by 25 bps in the third quarter of 2019.\n\"Going forward, in 2020, as growth accelerates, headline inflation begins to pick up, and Fed begins to increase rates, we expect pressure to build on the RBI to shift back to a tightening mode,\" it said.\nThe brokerage said RBI may increase rates next year - one hike of 25 bps each in Q1 and Q2 of 2020.\nIt, however, does not expect the RBI to increase rates in Q4, 2019.
