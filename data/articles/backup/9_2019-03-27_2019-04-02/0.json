A perfume bottle shaped like a grenade. A rusted circular saw blade. A pocket-sized pitchfork.\nNone of those is quite right. Then Johnston sees it: a guitar shaped like a semi-automatic rifle. Bingo. It will do nicely for the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s social media accounts.\nJohnston, TSA\u2019s social media director, is following in the footsteps of Curtis \u201cBob\u201d Burns, who created unlikely internet buzz for the not-always-beloved agency by showcasing the weirdest stuff travelers pack in their carry-ons. He died suddenly in October at age 48.\nBurns\u2019 work created a model for other federal agencies. The quirky photos combined with a hefty dose of dad humor helped lure in more than a million followers on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, who would then see important messages about the dos and don\u2019ts of airline travel.\n\u201cHow are we going to replace Bob? The reality is we can\u2019t,\u201d said Johnston. \u201cWe had a unique situation with him, but we can still be entertaining and help people as we find our way forward without him.\u201d\nOn the blog, Burns shared a weekly count of firearms that TSA officers found at checkpoints nationwide. He did a summary of knives and all matter of other bizarre and sometimes scary items that travelers had stuffed into their bags, pockets, purses or briefcases.\nIn one Instagram post, someone tried to bring on a glove with razors for fingers and Burns (naturally) made a \u201cNightmare on Elm Street\u201d joke.\n\u201cIt\u2019s safe to sleep on Elm Street again. Freddy lost his glove at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL).\u201d\nThe agency\u2019s Instagram account won three Webby awards last year, including the People\u2019s Voice Award for weird social content marketing. In his acceptance speech, Burns eyed the award, shook it and declared: \u201cThis Webby is carry-on approved!\u201d\nJohnston, who worked with Burns for about three years, and has been in government jobs for nearly a decade, has tried to keep it up all on his own, but it\u2019s been tough.\nJohnston sent out a Valentine\u2019s Day post that showed off a throwing star, ax and double-edged dagger confiscated from a passenger\u2019s carry-on bag. (\u201cSafe travels, you romantic fool!\u201d) And it was national puppy day recently, so that was an excuse for a photo of Cole, a big-eyed TSA explosives detection dog.\nTSA is growing its social media staff \u2014 bringing in three more workers to expand its social media presence. The staff will continue to use fodder sent in by officers around the country, who seize all manner of unusual items people try to bring onboard. But it\u2019s hard to find people who have both the government know-how and a sense of humor that resonates.\nJohnston said the thing that made Burns\u2019 posts so special was Burns himself.\n\u201cWhen you look at his posts, you\u2019re seeing a window into his soul,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really was from his heart. He was a fun, happy guy.\u201d\nBurns\u2019 sister-in-law, Candy Creech, said he had a dry sense of humor and a hefty dose of patriotism: He had served in the Gulf War.\nBurns had worked in airports before taking over TSA\u2019s social media and believed there was public negativity around the agency. He wanted to change that.\n\u201cAnd I think he felt he could change that by communicating with people in a way that wasn\u2019t scolding,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was one of a kind.\u201d\nDuring a TSA Facebook live, \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d episode last year, Burns said the success of the account was partly due to the shock value.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t come to a government Instagram account and expert to see humor,\u201d Burns said. \u201cAnd they also don\u2019t expect to see these crazy things that people are trying to bring on a plane.\u201d He had a wife and two daughters.\nAt Dulles, in the prohibited items section, Johnston sees a few possibilities for TSA\u2019s YouTube series called \u201cThey Brought What?\u201d including a large snow globe with big a white fairy imprisoned in some kind of liquid (It\u2019s creepy and it has liquid, so they can highlight the liquid restrictions.)\nHe passes over the four pairs of nunchucks (Yawn. You can\u2019t believe how many people bring those) and a handful of pocket knives. He stops at a large bullet from Afghanistan that has been altered to be a cigarette lighter and pen.\n\u201cThe things people think of,\u201d he says. Turning more serious for a moment, Johnston notes the importance of showing off these items, especially to people who aren\u2019t well-traveled and might not understand why something is prohibited if it\u2019s not actually a weapon.\n\u201cThe bottom line is our social media page makes travelers better informed so they have a better experience and it frees up our officers to do what they need to do \u2014 look for the bad actors,\u201d he says.

travelers continues to grow - Travel - Chinadaily.com.cn", "text": "The historical city of Xi'an in Northwest China's Shaanxi province, featuring the Dayan Pagoda and the Yellow River cruises are popular with tourists from the United States.[Photo provided to China Daily] People in the San Francisco Bay Area continue to show a growing interest in visiting China and exploring the country's culture, history, natural wonders and lifestyle, say US tour operators.\nAt the just-concluded annual Bay Area Travel and Adventure Show in Santa Clara, California, many visitors stopped at the booth of Alex Wang, a travel agency owner. They took brochures or asked him questions about the travel itineraries the company provided.\n\"We have attended the show for several years to promote our travel products. There's an increasing interest from Americans, including Chinese-Americans in the Bay Area,\" says Wang, president of Chinatour.com, a Southern California-based tour operator.\nIn front of a big picture of Beijing's Temple of Heaven, Wang handed out thousands of brochures and flyers at the recent two-day exhibition.\n\"We provide both high-end luxury tours and budget tours for young people,\" he says. \"Customers who are retired tend to choose long-haul tours, such as our Yangtze River cruise, which is very popular. Young people are usually attracted to short tours, such as weeklong visits to Beijing, Shanghai and Xi'an.\"\nThe Bay Area Travel and Adventure Show, which has been held for nine years in the region, is a major exhibition for tourists to find information about their desired destinations.\nThe event was projected to attract between 8,000 and 9,000 people this year, according to the organizer.\nThe booths of the China National Tourist Office and a few Chinese tourist agencies were among the most popular. People even waited in a line to get a free souvenir, such as Chinese zodiac bookmarks and panda calendars.\nCynthia Chang, who received a bookmark, says she had always wanted to visit her father's hometown in East China's Jiangsu province.

Share to facebook Share to linkedin Getty The luxury travel industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 7% between 2017 and 2021. Just look at Virtuoso , a bespoke luxury travel agency network: This company reported revenue growth of almost 90% in just five years, with a growth of more than $11 billion between 2013 and 2018.\nThe definition of \u201cluxury travel\u201d is subjective and has greatly evolved over the years. It is not just about staying at high-end resorts or having access to the best, most exclusive experiences; luxury travel is now about self-improvement and personal fulfillment .\nNeedless to say, it's an exciting time to be in the travel industry. As the founder and CEO of a platform for tailor-made luxury travel, I've seen that customer research has been of paramount importance both on the supplier and consumer sides.\nAmong some of this research, I've found that it is not solely the ultra-rich who are driving this growth. There is an array of consumers taking luxurious vacations who might change the way you imagine the modern luxe traveler. Below, I've outlined three key demographics that comprise portions of the luxury travel market (along with a few of my tips on how you can reach them).\nMillennial Luxury Travelers\nThere\u2019s a lot of talk about millennials, the generation that was born in the age of technology and innovation. According to a study by ITB Berlin and IPK International, more than half of international luxury trips are taken by this demographic. The group tends to be more active travelers and spend more of their discretionary income on experiences and crave authenticity.\nAs for discovering, planning and booking, I've found this demographic tends to use technology that can give them access to travel experts who are local to the destination. Therefore, I believe leaders looking to target millennials planning luxury vacations should aim to provide a frictionless, digital-first experience as they book their plans.\nNot only is the planning experience a key factor in reaching the millennial luxury travel market, but also authenticity . Content is key when it comes to building trust with these luxe travelers.

Numbers reported by luxury travel companies including Abercrombie & Kent, Black Tomato and REI confirm the rise of the solo female luxury traveler. According to Skift , \"women-only wellness retreats are the new luxury.\" These travelers care about staying healthy and at peace, as well as having consistent and flawless service from start to finish.\nIn my experience, this group tends to rely heavily on word-of-mouth recommendations and online reviews for new services, destinations and experiences. This isn't new; more and more people are beginning to trust online reviews as much as recommendations from friends. But when it comes to this specific group of luxury travelers, I've found that women traveling alone want to be able to trust the brands they use and feel safe while traveling. Implement a strategy to monitor and manage online reviews across review websites and self-owned channels to reach this group. And if someone leaves you a negative review, view it as a learning experience to respond professionally and address the issues they pointed out.\nExperienced Luxury Travelers\nBased on my observations while working in the luxe travel industry, this evergreen and growing segment tends to include Generation Xers and baby boomers . These groups are not new to traveling in luxury; I've found members of these generations tend to have more set tastes and preferences and are likely to be interested in more traditional luxury travel experiences.\nBeing experienced with this type of travel, I believe Gen Xers and baby boomers likely understand the importance and value of engaging an in-destination bespoke luxury travel expert during the planning process for unprecedented access to highly rated restaurants, hospitality and experiences.\nThese demographics are also less likely to be influenced by online advertisements than millennials, so consider marketing to them in more than one way to gain good exposure. For example, you might try reaching them through TV commercials or by sharing editorial reviews in travel columns of publications popular among the specific groups you're interested in.\nWithout a doubt, the luxury travel market is ripe for disruption, and I believe the businesses that will emerge and thrive will focus on leveraging intuitive technology products that empower the combination of extraordinary human expertise, curation, unmatched access and personal touch. Ultimately, the companies that most deeply understand the changing needs and expectations of those who are truly taking luxury vacations will not only be able to capitalize on this growing opportunity, but also shape up the future of modern luxe travel.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "council post", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T15:21:20.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "644dc9b6c9aee54d53ace09ecb29c8c19fcfed50", "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/90328558/singapore-and-southwest-top-tripadvisors-favorite-airlines-for-2019?partner=feedburner&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=feedburner+fastcompany&utm_content=feedburner", "site_full": "www.fastcompany.com", "site": "fastcompany.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["sci_fi_and_fantasy", "hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "", "title": "TripAdvisor travelers' favorite airlines for 2019", "title_full": "TripAdvisor travelers' favorite airlines for 2019", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2019/04/p-1-singapore-and-southwest-airlines-top-tripadvisorand8217s-favorite-airlines-for-2019.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3157, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 25, "comments": 4, "shares": 25}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "644dc9b6c9aee54d53ace09ecb29c8c19fcfed50", "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/90328558/singapore-and-southwest-top-tripadvisors-favorite-airlines-for-2019?partner=feedburner&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=feedburner+fastcompany&utm_content=feedburner", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sports.yahoo.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "TripAdvisor travelers' favorite airlines for 2019", "text": "When booking a plane ticket, most of us just choose whichever airline has the cheapest fare to Cleveland or Slough or wherever it is we\u2019re spring breaking.

Read my Advertiser Disclosure policy here. Additionally, some of the offers on this page may no longer be available through Deals We Like.\nLast week I wrote about a fast tracked way to earn World of Hyatt Explorist and Globalist status , the only caveat was that a sales manager had to actually register you for the promotion. Fortunately though, it seems like the site is now publicly available where you can actually enroll yourself in this status match and challenge \u2014 if you work for a company that qualifies. Although there is not a published list of companies that will actually be eligible, I have been told that any corporate traveler is eligible. All you have to do is enter your work email address and you should be enrolled.\nAfter registering for the promotion, you\u2019ll receive automatic Hyatt Explorist status for the next 90 days and then have the opportunity to maintain that status or even move up to Hyatt Globalist status, depending on the number of stays you complete. Explorist status challenge: Stay 10 nights within 90 days Globalist status challenge: Stay 20 nights within 90 days\nIf you are able to complete the challenge, your earned status will be valid through February 28, 2021 \u2014 giving you almost two years of this awesome status! This particular promotion goes through November 28, 2019, so you might want to plan accordingly when registering. If you do not have an upcoming Hyatt stay until this summer, for example, wait until then to enroll. Just keep in mind that it could take a few days for your registration to go through, so do not wait until the 11th hour before your stay. Globalist status got us a two-bedroom suite in Clearwater Beach just a few months ago! You Will Not Earn Milestone Benefits\nWhen you receive status through a match or challenge, you unfortunately do not earn all of the benefits that actually come with the status. With these milestone benefits you actually have to stay the required number of nights to earn the status. For example, when you stay 20 nights and 30 nights you\u2019ll earn 2 club lounge awards (4 total). When you earn Explorist status through the challenge, you will not receive those awards to use on an upcoming stay. Same holds true for the suite night upgrades \u2014 you earn 2 when you stay 50 and 60 nights (4 total), and not by just having Globalist status.\nOf course, having the status will still get you many benefits such as: Explorist benefits: 20% bonus on points earned, 2pm late checkout, upgrade to the best available room (excluding suites and based on availability), etc. Globalist benefits: 30% bonus on points earned, 4pm late checkout, upgrade to the best available room (including suites and based on availability, club lounge access, resort fees waived on paid rooms, 4pm late checkout, club lounge access, complimentary parking on a free night award, guest of honor access, etc.\nHyatt is by far my favorite hotel chain at the moment , despite having Marriott Titanium status for life! The benefits give my family real value and make us want to pick Hyatt every single time for our family vacations. Overall\u2026\nI am personally so glad to see this offer surface since I just lost my Hyatt Globalist status in February and we planned for my husband to earn Globalist status this year . If you are a corporate traveler, this is a great opportunity to earn Explorist or Globalist status and enjoy the perks of Hyatt!\nHave you been able to take advantage of this status match opportunity? Comment below! World of Hyatt Credit Card Earn up to 5 0,000 bonus points \u2014 25,000 bonus points after you spend $3,000 on purchases within the first 3 months of account opening, plus an additional 25,000 bonus points after you spend $6,000 total on purchases within the first 6 months of account opening. Earn 5 stays towards status, plus 2 stays for every $5,000 spent on the card (no cap). Earn a free night certificate every year on your cardmember anniversary (valid for category 1-4 properties). $95 annual fee.\nDisclosure: This post contains affiliate links.

TSA\u2019s social media presence has been something of a model for other federal agencies _ striking a tone is humorous, but still gives travelers informational dos and don\u2019ts. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen) WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 David Johnston stands over a table full of peculiar items confiscated at Dulles International Airport: a glittery clutch with brass knuckles as a clasp. A perfume bottle shaped like a grenade. A rusted circular saw blade. A pocket-sized pitchfork. None of those is quite right. Then Johnston sees it: a guitar shaped like a semi-automatic rifle. Bingo. It will do nicely for the Transportation Security Administration's social media accounts. Johnston, TSA's social media director, is following in the footsteps of Curtis \"Bob\" Burns, who created unlikely internet buzz for the not-always-beloved agency by showcasing the weirdest stuff travelers pack in their carry-ons. He died suddenly in October at age 48. Burns' work created a model for other federal agencies. The quirky photos combined with a hefty dose of dad humor helped lure in more than a million followers on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, who would then see important messages about the dos and don'ts of airline travel. \"How are we going to replace Bob? The reality is we can't,\" said Johnston. \"We had a unique situation with him, but we can still be entertaining and help people as we find our way forward without him.\" On the blog, Burns shared a weekly count of firearms that TSA officers found at checkpoints nationwide. He did a summary of knives and all matter of other bizarre and sometimes scary items that travelers had stuffed into their bags, pockets, purses or briefcases. In one Instagram post , someone tried to bring on a glove with razors for fingers and Burns (naturally) made a \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" joke. \"It's safe to sleep on Elm Street again. Freddy lost his glove at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL).\" The agency's Instagram account won three Webby awards last year, including the People's Voice Award for weird social content marketing. In his acceptance speech, Burns eyed the award, shook it and declared: \"This Webby is carry-on approved!\" Johnston, who worked with Burns for about three years, and has been in government jobs for nearly a decade, has tried to keep it up all on his own, but it's been tough. Johnston sent out a Valentine's Day post that showed off a throwing star, ax and double-edged dagger confiscated from a passenger's carry-on bag. (\"Safe travels, you romantic fool!\") And it was national puppy day recently, so that was an excuse for a photo of Cole, a big-eyed TSA explosives detection dog. TSA is growing its social media staff \u2014 bringing in three more workers to expand its social media presence. The staff will continue to use fodder sent in by officers around the country, who seize all manner of unusual items people try to bring onboard. But it's hard to find people who have both the government know-how and a sense of humor that resonates. Johnston said the thing that made Burns' posts so special was Burns himself. \"When you look at his posts, you're seeing a window into his soul,\" he said. \"It really was from his heart. He was a fun, happy guy.\" Burns' sister-in-law, Candy Creech, said he had a dry sense of humor and a hefty dose of patriotism: He had served in the Gulf War. Burns had worked in airports before taking over TSA's social media and believed there was public negativity around the agency. He wanted to change that. \"And I think he felt he could change that by communicating with people in a way that wasn't scolding,\" she said. \"He was one of a kind.\" During a TSA Facebook live, \"Ask Me Anything\" episode last year, Burns said the success of the account was partly due to the shock value. \"People don't come to a government Instagram account and expert to see humor,\" Burns said. \"And they also don't expect to see these crazy things that people are trying to bring on a plane.\" He had a wife and two daughters. At Dulles, in the prohibited items section, Johnston sees a few possibilities for TSA's YouTube series called \"They Brought What?\" including a large snow globe with big a white fairy imprisoned in some kind of liquid (It's creepy and it has liquid, so they can highlight the liquid restrictions.) He passes over the four pairs of nunchucks (Yawn. You can't believe how many people bring those) and a handful of pocket knives. He stops at a large bullet from Afghanistan that has been altered to be a cigarette lighter and pen. \"The things people think of,\" he says. Turning more serious for a moment, Johnston notes the importance of showing off these items, especially to people who aren't well-traveled and might not understand why something is prohibited if it's not actually a weapon. \"The bottom line is our social media page makes travelers better informed so they have a better experience and it frees up our officers to do what they need to do \u2014 look for the bad actors,\" he says.

The legroom was better than on most economy flights and the luggage allowance also better.The offloading of luggage and our customs clearance were remarkably quick so on the return flight we cleared the airport in record time. If this is standard, then Jet2 must be right at the top for service.\u201d \u2013 TripAdvisor member Geoff J . #8 \u2013 Air New Zealand 10895 Reviews\n\u201cI highly recommend the Dreamliner flight with Premium Economy with Air Zealand. I was treated like I was in first class the entire flight! Everything was superior and I am afraid no other flight in my future will ever match this one!\u201d \u2013 TripAdvisor member Julia1138 . #7 \u2013 Azul 12949 Reviews\n\u201cI had never flown on this airline before and was so impressed! The flight attendants were spotless in their appearance and I loved their attire. The food was amazing and not knowing any Portuguese the attendants efficiency talked to me in English. I was in economy but felt like first class!!\u201d \u2013 TripAdvisor member Kathy Y . #6 \u2013 Southwest Airlines 34992 Reviews\n\u201cI was really impressed with Southwest Airlines. Customer service was awesome. I still got a good seat in spite of a full plane. There was enough leg room in regular seating for a person like myself with long legs. I will use Southwest Airlines more often.\u201d \u2013 TripAdvisor member deborahlindsey . #5 \u2013 Japan Airlines (JAL) 7140 Reviews\n\u201cThe flight crew on Japan Airlines is like no other I have ever experienced! All of the attendants were professional, caring, friendly, patient and accommodating. It was the best experience I have ever had on any airlines. Nothing seems to rattle this crew, and they communicate in a very genuine manner, by making eye contact and speaking to passengers at their level. The food, water, snacks and refreshments were tasty and plentiful. We even were served my favorite ice cream for dessert. I am now a happy customer, for life! \u2013 TripAdvisor member HealandLiveWell . #4 \u2013 Emirates 48569 Reviews\n\u201cEmirates were quite honestly the best airline we have ever travelled with. Seats are incredibly comfortable and spacious. Staff are friendly and helpful and couldn\u2019t do more for you. The children in particular were treated so well and really enjoyed their journey.\u201d \u2013 TripAdvisor member hayleywatson28 . #3 \u2013 EVA Air 5286 Reviews\n\u201cI have been flying with EVA Airways every time I travel to Asia since they started flying years ago. They are by far one of the best airlines out there. The airplane is clean, service is good and their on-time percentage is higher than many other airlines I have flown (I fly quite often). I will not fly with any other airline so long EVA Airways has services in the areas. I am definitely their loyal frequent flyer.\u201d \u2013 TripAdvisor member Glo116 . #2 \u2013 Qatar Airways 22818 Reviews\n\u201cComplete Luxury 37,000ft above the ground. From the cleanliness of the aircraft to the amazing service what more could they offer. Dine on demand, premium drinks as much as you want and when you want! Staff very friendly.\u201d \u2013 TripAdvisor member Martin L . #1 \u2013 Singapore Airlines 19174 Reviews\n\u201cIt is one of the best airlines i have traveled so far. It has very comfortable seats. A very good food and wine menu. And a very clean and well maintained aircraft. Totally one of the best choices to travel.\u201d \u2013 TripAdvisor member deepanshuahuja.\nCheck out more Travelers\u2019 Choice airlines, as determined by you and millions of other TripAdvisor reviewers, here .
