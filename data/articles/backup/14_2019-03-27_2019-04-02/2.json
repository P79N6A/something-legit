The Federal Reserve last week brought its three-year campaign to tighten monetary policy to an abrupt end.\nThe U.S. central bank abandoned projections for any interest rate hikes this year after increasing borrowing costs four times in 2018, in a nod to the slowing economy, low inflation and rising headwinds to growth. The economy is losing steam as the stimulus from $1.5 trillion in tax cuts as well as increased government spending dissipates.\n\"Unless some positive shock hits the economy, by the fall, we are likely to be back to where we were before the tax cut bill was passed,\" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, edged up 0.1 percent as households cut back on purchases of motor vehicles. Spending fell 0.6 percent in December.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending increasing 0.3 percent in January. The release of the January consumer spending figures was delayed by a five-week partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25.\nWhen adjusted for inflation, consumer spending gained 0.1 percent in January after dropping 0.6 percent in December.\nThe dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell, while stocks on Wall Street rose.\nWEAK DATA STREAM\nThe weak consumer spending report extended the run of soft data ranging from housing starts to manufacturing that have flagged a sharp slowdown in growth early in the first quarter. The economy's outlook is also being overshadowed by slowing global growth, Washington's trade war with China and uncertainty over Britain's departure from the European Union.\nGross domestic product forecasts for the first quarter are as low as a 0.9 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter after expanding at a brisk 3.4 percent rate in the July-September period.\nBut the Fed's decision to shelve further monetary policy tightening could prop up the interest-rate-sensitive housing market. A second report on Friday from the Commerce Department showed new home sales rose 4.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 667,000 units in February, the highest level since March 2018.\nThe housing market, however, accounts for a small fraction of the economy. A recovery in the sector, which hit a soft patch last year, will probably not be enough to blunt the impact on growth from slowing consumer spending and manufacturing.\nA third report from the University of Michigan showed a rise in consumer sentiment in March. Economists, however, did not expect this to translate into stronger consumer spending as other confidence measures softened during the month.\n\"Spending will downshift to the slowest pace in a year in the first quarter,\" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.\nIn January, spending on goods fell 0.2 percent after dropping 2.4 percent in December. It was the second straight monthly decline in spending on goods and reflected a decrease in motor vehicle purchases.\nOutlays on services rose 0.2 percent as consumers paid more for financial services and insurance, after increasing 0.3 percent in December.\nWith demand softening, inflation pressures were tame in January. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index fell 0.1 percent, reversing December's 0.1 percent gain.\nIn the 12 month through January, the PCE price index rose 1.4 percent, the smallest rise since September 2016 after increasing 1.8 percent in December.\nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index ticked up 0.1 percent in January after rising 0.2 percent in the prior month. That lowered the year-on-year increase in the so-called core PCE price index to 1.8 percent from 2.0 percent in December.\nThe core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. It hit the U.S. central bank's 2 percent inflation target in March last year for the first time since April 2012.\nIn February, personal income increased 0.2 percent after dipping 0.1 percent in January. Incomes have been volatile in recent months because of one-off factors, including government payments to farmers caught in the U.S.-China trade war.\nWages rose 0.3 percent in February, matching January's gain. Savings decreased to $1.19 trillion last month from $1.22 trillion in January.\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci and James Dalgleish)\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

This is the starting point of evaluating the feasibility of the minimum income guarantee scheme spoken about by an Opposition party which is an election promise. We have also had similar announcements of Rs 15 lakh being transferred to the accounts of the poor from the black money that would be unearthed. This has not happened. Therefore, we need to distinguish between an intention and its fructification.\nThis said, theoretically one can evaluate the economics of a scheme where Rs 72,000 is given to every poor family after due identification where preliminary estimates put it as 5 crore families or 250 million people. The cost outlay is around Rs 3.6 lakh crore per annum if fully implemented. There are two sets of issues here which can be examined. The first is the feasibility of the scheme in terms of the economics and the second is the logistics of implementation. Both are necessary to address to have any successful scheme.\nTo begin with, it must be said that any income transfer to a set of households is ideologically tuned to the concept of \u2018direct benefit transfer\u2019 (DBT) where amounts are being transferred to a Jan Dhan account. Similarly, if one is in principle okay with a universal basic income approach, then this scheme of minimum income guarantee is a modification of the same where the beneficiaries are not universal but a targeted section.\nAn objection normally put across for such cash transfers is that the government should focus more on creating jobs than give money. But we have seen that this does not work as in the last 20 years or so with the exception of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) programme where unproductive work is given, people are not able to get sustainable work. By waiting for jobs to be created, the marginalised have been further aggrandized. Therefore, direct cash transfer is the way out howsoever humongous the amount involved may be. Representational image. Reuters.\nNow coming to the economics of the scheme, can we bear the cost of Rs 3.6 lakh crore? If the amount is being spread over a period of time, then it can be accommodated within the fiscal parameters that are being adhered to.\nThis means that the number of households covered would gradually increase over say 3-5 years such that in the terminal year the amount would be Rs 3.6 lakh crore, which is similar to the Rs 75,000 cr allocation made in the present Budget for the prime minister's Rs 6,000 per family scheme.\nAs the Budget size keeps increasing normally by around 10 percent per annum the present size of about Rs 27.5 lakh crore would grow to close to Rs 44-45 lakh crore in five years and hence the incremental amount can absorb Rs 3.6 lakh crore.\nHowever, if it has to be a one shot measure where all families are covered in the first year of implementation, this would be out of the realm of the Budget unless more revenue is raised which is unlikely.\nThe practical way of going about this exercise is to substitute this amount for schemes of the government which already exists. Hence, food subsidy, farm insurance premium, health insurance premium, MNREGA, mid-day meal scheme, pensions, etc., can be merged and cash be given to all the families. As these households are already identified, it will make the job easier.\nThis way, the entire amount of Rs 3.6 lakh crore would not be a top-up but a makeover of existing schemes. This has already been done in the last few years where several health schemes and those for women, girls, education etc., have been merged and presented as new programmes. The problem of doing away with these schemes is that it would make several government departments less relevant and also weaken institutions that have been created over the years.\nFor example using DBT for food subsidy would make the fair price shops redundant and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) relevant only for buffer stocking and not full procurement. This is a tough call that has to be taken.\nAlso, merging schemes will mean that the benefit from an existing one like say mid-day meal scheme will diminish as families may prefer to sue the money for some other purpose and not send children to school. Therefore, merging of schemes though useful has to be done after sufficient research to ensure that we do not close down important institutions.\nThe second part, which is very crucial in our context, is the logistics involved as most of the public schemes fail because of implementation issues. Identifying the beneficiaries is a challenge. This scheme is to cover all the poor and not just the farmers which was part of the budgetary announcement of the Rs 6,000 per annum scheme.\nThe indication given is that having less than Rs 6,000 per month income qualifies a family as being poor \u2013 which means broadly speaking Rs 200 a day which can be mapped to the MNREGA wage on an average basis. How does one get to know the income of any family especially as there are no records of the same?\nWhen schemes are merged and the resulting funds used for the transfer purpose the identification process would be easier. For some schemes the Census data was used where the beneficiary was identified on ownership of assets or income. But what happens to families which were not covered or have entered the less than Rs 6,000 per month category subsequently.\nAdverse selection cannot be ruled out here. Also, once the amount is given, it will be hard to take the beneficiaries out of the scheme even if their income improves and they are out of the poverty circle. This is a challenge which will also mean that this amount has to keep increasing as more people claim to be poor. It will lead to gaming the system with corruption becoming a part as various authorities who are entrusted with identification like say the local panchayat would hold sway over the people.\nWhile the scheme is theoretically good, the details have to be worked out before implementation as given the amount involved and the several avenues of leakages being there, can degenerate into a scam. This is definitely a potential threat.\n(The writer is chief economist, CARE ratings)\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

Real estate and technology shares led the market, but consumer stocks fell as investors begin to look forward to second-quarter earnings reports.\nToday's stock market\nAs for individual stocks, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) blamed accelerating macro trends for a big earnings miss and a weaker outlook, while DowDuPont (NYSE: DWDP) completed the spinoff of the new Dow (NYSE: DOW).\nLower drug reimbursements and falling retail sales hit Walgreens Walgreens reported disappointing fiscal second-quarter results and drastically lowered its outlook for the year due to reimbursement pressure and lower pharmacy and retail volumes, and shares plummeted 12.8% . Sales increased 4.6% to $34.5 billion thanks to stores acquired from Rite Aid , but adjusted earnings per share decreased 5.4% to $1.64. Wall Street was expecting EPS of $1.74 on sales of $34.6 billion. Walgreens lowered its outlook for full-year EPS to flat growth compared with earlier guidance of an increase between 7% and 12%.\nCEO Stefano Pessina said that macro trends that have been headwinds for Walgreens accelerated in the quarter and the company didn&apos;t respond fast enough. Drug reimbursement pressure hurt profit and slower generic deflation meant lower utilization of generics, which have better reimbursement economics. Adjusted gross margin in U.S. retail pharmacy fell 2.6 percentage points to 23.2%.

Christine Lagarde Photographer: Justin Chin/Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Go inside the global economy with Stephanie Flanders in her new podcast, Stephanomics. Sign up here.\nGlobal growth has lost momentum since the start of the year, leaving the world economy in a \u201cprecarious\u201d position, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said.\nThe global economy has weakened since the International Monetary Fund last updated its forecast in late January, though a recession isn\u2019t likely in the near term, Lagarde said Tuesday in remarks prepared for a speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington.\nLagarde characterized the slowdown as a \u201csynchronized deceleration\u201d during a panel discussion after her speech.\nIn January, the fund lowered its projection for world economic growth, forecasting expansion of 3.5 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2020. It was the IMF\u2019s second cut in the outlook in three months. The fund will release its new World Economic Outlook with an updated growth forecast on April 9.\n\u201cThe global economy is at a \u2018delicate moment,\u2019\u201d Lagarde said in her speech.\nHer warning comes as global finance ministers and central bankers prepare to convene in Washington next week for the semi-annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank. While confidence has been boosted by the Federal Reserve\u2019s switch to a more patient stance and signs of a trade deal between the U.S. and China, investors remain concerned the global expansion may be running out of steam a decade after the financial crisis.\nRate Patience\nLagarde said the global economy is set to benefit from the patience of major central banks, as well as increased stimulus by the Chinese government. The IMF predicts global growth will pick up \u201csome\u201d in the second half of 2019 and into 2020, she said.\nStill, that rebound remains vulnerable to a host of risks, including Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, high debt in some sectors and countries, trade tensions and \u201ca sense of unease in financial markets,\u201d Lagarde said.\nGiven the state of the global economy, it\u2019s important for policy makers to avoid missteps, she said. Monetary policy should remain accommodative where inflation is below target, while exchange-rate flexibility should be used as needed, according to Lagarde. Regulatory reforms aimed at strengthening the financial sector should continue, she added.\nHigh public debt and low interest rates have left \u201climited room to act when the next downturn comes, which inevitably it will,\u201d she said. \u201cFor many countries, this implies making smarter use of fiscal policy.\u201d\nThe market power of corporations has been increasing, with the highest price markups being imposed by a \u201csmall number of highly dynamic companies,\u201d a trend that is especially pronounced in the digital economy, Lagarde said.\nMarket Power\n\u201cI am not saying that we currently have a \u2018monopoly problem.\u2019 But I am saying that we should take appropriate measures -- so that it does not become a problem,\u201d she said.\nLagarde reiterated her warning for countries to avoid imposing new tariffs on each other. An increase in tariffs by 25 percentage points on all goods traded between the U.S. and China would reduce annual output in the U.S. by up to 0.6 percent, and up to 1.5 percent in China, she said.\n\u201cThese are potentially self-inflicted wounds that should be avoided,\u201d Lagarde said.\nHigh-level trade talks between the U.S. and China resume this week in Washington amid hopes the world\u2019s two biggest economies can reach a deal to end their trade war.\n(Updates with Lagarde comment in third paragraph.)\nLagarde Says Global Economy Has Lost Momentum Since January", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=179222828858436&u=https%3A%2F%2Fau.investing.com%2Fnews%2Feconomy-news%2Flagarde-says-global-economy-has-lost-momentum-since-january-1420772&display=popup&ref=plugin", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fau.investing.com%2Fnews%2Feconomy-news%2Flagarde-says-global-economy-has-lost-momentum-since-january-1420772&title=Lagarde+Says+Global+Economy+Has+Lost+Momentum+Since+January&summary=", "https://invst.ly/ag0j8"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lagarde", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "justin chin/bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "christine lagarde", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "stephanomics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephanie flanders", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "imf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international monetary fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. chamber of commerce", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T01:07:44.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "90688df400fde6dde4e8a5badeb19d303f13a508", "url": "https://www.fxstreet.com/news/nzd-usd-better-than-forecast-new-zealand-gdt-data-triggered-short-covering-from-200-day-sma-201904022219", "site_full": "www.fxstreet.com", "site": "fxstreet.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "", "title": "NZD/USD: Better than forecast New Zealand GDT data triggered short covering from 200-day SMA", "title_full": "NZD/USD: Better than forecast New Zealand GDT data triggered short covering from 200-day SMA", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.023, "main_image": "https://editorial.azureedge.net/images/Markets/Currencies/Majors/NZDUSD/new-zealand-dollars-16422943_Large.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9758, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "90688df400fde6dde4e8a5badeb19d303f13a508", "url": "https://www.fxstreet.com/news/nzd-usd-better-than-forecast-new-zealand-gdt-data-triggered-short-covering-from-200-day-sma-201904022219", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "NZD/USD: Better than forecast New Zealand GDT data triggered short covering from 200-day SMA", "text": "Upbeat GDT Price Index favored buyers from 200-day SMA support.

The pair earlier dropped to 200-day simple moving average (SMA) after overall USD strength dragged it under 0.6770 trend-line. However, better than the forecast New Zealand GDT price index triggered the quote\u2019s recent pullback ahead of another domestic data namely ANZ commodity.\nThe sluggish print of New Zealand NZIER business confidence damaged previous risk-on rally in antipodeans whereas overall market support for the greenback amid safe-haven demand continued dragging the NZD/USD pair downwards.\nWhile weak readings from the US durable goods orders couldn\u2019t stop sellers from portraying a dip beneath the ten-week-old ascending support-line to visit 200-day SMA, better than the forecast +0.3% growth of New Zealand GDT price index to +0.8% versus +1.9% prior activated price pullback from important SMA.\nMarch month reading of ANZ commodity price from New Zealand can gain immediate market attention. The figure is less likely to favor recent pullback if matching -0.3% forecast compared to +2.8% previous. From the US side, ADP employment change, Markit services PMI and ISM non-manufacturing PMI will be in limelight.\nThe ADP employment change, an early signal to Friday\u2019s NFP , might have softened to 170K from 183K in March whereas Markit services PMI could confirm 54.3 initial estimations. Also, ISM non-manufacturing PMI could drop to 58.0 from 59.7 earlier.\nAdditionally, China\u2019s Caixin services PMI can also have its impact on New Zealand Dollar (NZD) as the dragon nation is Kiwi\u2019s second largest customer and world\u2019s largest commodity user. Market consensus support 52.3 figure of Caixin services PMI against 51.1 previous.\nNZD/USD Technical Analysis\n200-day SMA level of 0.6730 becomes an important support, a break of which can open doors for the downward trajectory to 0.6690 and 0.6650.\nOn the upside, support-turned-resistance at 0.6770 and 100-day SMA level of 0.6815 can limit the quote\u2019s immediate upside.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

We can have our carbon levy, but ultimately it\u2019s not going to have any effect. There\u2019s a lot of countries around the world that don\u2019t follow any kind of carbon taxes.\u201d\nThat is not to say he believes oil is a sustainable economic driver in the long term. A diversified economy, and one that taps into alternative energy sources such as solar power, he adds, will eventually be less expensive and more feasible than the cost of extracting and burning fossil fuels.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want all my clients to be working in the oil industry,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember. I went through 2015 when it was at its worst. A chunk of my clients were losing their jobs or taking money out of their RRSPs, things like that.\u201d\nUntil technology catches up to make alternative energy more feasible and diversify the province\u2019s oil-dependent economy, he\u2019s in favour of banking on Alberta oil and relying on the free market to innovate solutions to climate change.\n\u201cThat oil is ours. It\u2019s Alberta\u2019s. We have to get revenue out of it and do good things with it,\u201d he says, mentioning health care, education, as well as firefighting and flood mitigation to address the environmental effects of a warming planet.\nApropos of the conversation, he drops a three-letter word onto the board: \u201cOil.\u201d What do you think?\nTucker, however, doesn\u2019t see the sense in using oil revenues to pay for the some of the more disastrous effects of a warming planet.\n\u201cThe problem with just letting the market sort out climate change is that we\u2019re coming up against real (physical) limits where we have a carbon budget\u2014we have a finite amount that we can put into the atmosphere before seeing impacts that we absolutely cannot undo,\u201d she explains. \u201cYou can\u2019t bomb on your way to peace, and it\u2019s the same thing with this.\u201d\nAccording to a recent report by Environment and Climate Change Canada, the average annual temperature across Canada has increased by 1.7 C, more than twice the global average increase over the same time. It also expects temperatures to rise over the next 20 years despite efforts to cut climate-changing emissions, and says the country will likely see effects such as rising sea levels, shrinking glaciers and Arctic ice cover, and an increased risk of summer water shortages, along with more frequent droughts, floods and wildfires.\nCountering Muhs\u2019s three-point word a few moves later, she responds with a carbon-trapping play: \u201cPines.\u201d\nRather than relying on the free market to find a way out of the climate crisis, Tucker says solutions require direct and intentional effort, including government action. And while she\u2019s not impressed by the pro-pipeline platforms of the NDP and UCP, she is willing to give the NDP a nod for their climate plan, which includes the carbon tax that helps pay for renewable-energy projects and energy-efficiency programs.\n\u201cThe carbon-tax system is only effective, in my mind, to the extent that it\u2019s investing in those solutions,\u201d she says.\nFor Muhs the carbon tax is an unfair tool. He\u2019s counting on a change in government that puts pollution pricing on the chopping block.\n\u201cI live in a small condo and I don\u2019t drive very far to work,\u201d he explains. \u201cI don\u2019t expend a lot of carbon and I don\u2019t pay a ton of carbon levy, but somebody who lives in the country, or farmer or whatnot, their tax is unfair,\u201d he says.\nAccording to the Alberta government, the cost of the carbon tax is most noticeable when it comes to heating fuel and drying grain. The province offers exemptions for certain fuels used in farming operations and funding for programs to improve efficiency and reduce emissions.\nHowever, Tucker noted, the government has also offered support to the fossil fuel industry.\nAccording to a February report by Environmental Defence and the International Institute for Sustainable Development, the Alberta government, through measures like tax provisions and research grants, provided an average of at least $1.6 billion a year in over the last three years (including more than $2 billion in 2017-18) to support oil, gas and coal production.\nInstead, Tucker suggested, the government should shift that financial support to green energy, renewable resources and climate-change solutions. It\u2019s not the free-market approach Muhs is calling for, but she was quick to point out a common thread running through their opposing views.\n\u201cWe disagree about how social change happens,\u201d Tucker explains, \u201cbut I think there\u2019s a common ground that change really does need to happen. It\u2019s just a very different analysis of how we get there.\u201d\nWith files from Alex Ballingall\nHamdi Issawi is an Edmonton-based reporter covering the environment and energy.

In its updated preliminary prospectus, filed last week, Beyond Meat points to the successful launch of A&W Canada\u2019s Beyond Burger as an indicator of the company\u2019s international potential. More than 90,000 patties sold in the first three days, product sell-outs and increasing guest counts \u201cindicating that The Beyond Burger was driving incremental business.\u201d As readers are no doubt aware, A&W has since followed up with the launch of the Beyond Meat Sausage and Egger breakfast sandwich.\nBeyond Mean encouraged grocers to sell the cook-from-raw Beyond Burger (and sausages) in the meat section, \u201cwhere meat-loving consumers are accustomed to shopping for center-of-plate proteins.\u201d ( Beyond Meat ) What the consumer is experiencing, and what makes this a business story of note, is the pivot away from the conventional presentation of \u201cveggie\u201d burgers, the awakening of powerful multinational food giants and the disclosure of financial information that illuminates changing consumer tastes. Here\u2019s a morsel: Beyond Meat\u2019s net revenues came in at $88 million (U.S.) in 2018. That is not a big number, unless placed in context against the $16.2 million in net revenues in 2016.\nJust this week Burger King launched a test run of its meatless Impossible Whopper in the U.S. while the food giant Nestl\u00e9 announced that it would be introducing the Incredible Burger in Europe this month, to be followed in the fall with the Awesome Burger aimed at the American market. No, Nestl\u00e9 hasn\u2019t suddenly set up burger joints. The Swiss-based company, with sales last year of $91.5 billion, is offering a cook-from-raw 100-per-cent plant-based burger to be sold in grocery stores.\nEthan Brown, the founder and CEO of California-based Beyond Meat, must view these entrants and others as Johnny Come Latelies. And he should be made anxious by the size of such giants as Nestl\u00e9.\n But Brown can take credit for reimagining the potential of non-meat protein. His letter to shareholders in the prospectus doesn\u2019t offer any snappy takeaways. Rather there\u2019s a deeply embedded earnestness that weaves \u201cAustralopithecus Africanus\u201d and \u201ccarnivorous tendencies\u201d and \u201csophisticated hominids\u201d into a single paragraph, which might have had the underwriters at Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan scratching their heads.\nWhat emerges from this is authenticity as Brown recounts time spent in his early years at the family dairy farm. \u201cAs a child, I was fascinated by the animals surrounding us: the companions at our sides, the livestock in the barns and fields, and the wildlife in the woods,\u201d he writes. \u201cAs a young adult, I enjoyed a career in clean energy but continued to wrestle with a question born of these early days: do we need animals to produce meat?\u201d\nShare your thoughts I will not cede to cynicism here.\nIn the past eight years Beyond Meat has not only developed a plant-based burger that tastes like real meat, but set about changing the perception and positioning of the product. Quoting from the prospectus again: \u201cThe success of our breakthrough innovation model and products has allowed us to appeal to a broad range of consumers, including those who typically eat animal-based meats, positioning us to compete directly in the $1.4-trillion global meat industry.\u201d\nThe smart push by the company was to encourage grocery retailers to sell the cook-from-raw Beyond Burger (and sausages) in the meat section, \u201cwhere meat-loving consumers are accustomed to shopping for center-of-plate proteins.\u201d\nIs this a binary choice to eat or abandon meat? Brown argues no. An interesting statistic: 93 per cent of consumers who purchased the Beyond Burger at the U.S. grocery chain Kroger across a six-month period last year also purchased meat.\nThis does, however, suggest a recalibration, and the health and environmental upsides to plant-based proteins are emphasized, from a 90 per cent reduction on greenhouse gas emissions to 46 per cent less energy usage.\n Those efficiency gains, Brown argues, open future wealth creation opportunities for farmers by converting to higher value protein crops. \u201cI believe there is a new dawn for American agriculture and this conversion is our awakening hour.\u201d\nThat will sound a bit rich to seasoned investors. And the challenges the company faces will only grow. Beyond Meat needs to expand manufacturing, vastly increase production capacity, build a bigger distribution channel and so on if it is going to face the competition with strength.\nEmerging growth companies that are successful in businesses where major players already have a century of experience behind them tend to follow the path to ultimate takeover. I hope this doesn\u2019t happen. Younger consumers need to be able to believe in an enterprise that was pushed to market first not by dreams of profits, but a firm belief in meeting the urgent needs of an ever-changing planet.\nJennifer Wells is a business columnist based in Toronto.

By Jaclyn Reiss Globe Staff April 02, 2019\nAfter sitting on the market for 12 years, rapper 50 Cent\u2019s 50,000-square-foot mansion in Farmington, Conn., has finally sold \u2014 for millions of dollars below the original asking price.\nThe opulent 19-bedroom, 25-bathroom home at 50 Poplar Hill Drive (we see what you did there, Fiddy) was originally listed for $18.5 million in 2007. However, a deal was recently brokered by Jennifer Leahy of Douglas Elliman Real Estate for $2.9 million.\nOf course, this isn\u2019t just your run-of-the-mill mansion. Set on 17 acres, the estate has \u201ca substantial night club,\u201d multiple game rooms, an indoor court, a green-screen room, a recording studio, a full gym, a home theater, a conference room, a pool \u201cgrotto,\u201d separate guest houses, a basketball court, and landscaped gardens.\nAdvertisement \u201cIt is one of the few homes in Connecticut that have approved grounds for landing a helicopter which makes for easy access from/to New York City,\u201d a listing from Douglas Elliman stated.\nGet Metro Headlines in your inbox: The 10 top local news stories from metro Boston and around New England delivered daily.

The sale\u2019s proceeds would be donated to the rapper\u2019s nonprofit, G-Unity Foundation Inc , the Journal reported.\nIn an interview with the Hartford Courant, Leahy, the listing agent, declined to name the buyer. Leahy could not immediately be reached by the Globe for comment.\nDouglas Elliman Real Estate\nAdvertisement In a January appearance on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\u201d the rapper talked a bit about why he didn\u2019t want the house anymore.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a big house no more. I experienced that with the Tyson mansion,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cYou look down the hallway, and you go \u2014 [you know] whenever you look down a hallway in your house and you don\u2019t want to go down there?\u201d\nColbert cracked up before asking, \u201cBecause it\u2019s so long?\u201d\n\u201cYou go, \u2018I don\u2019t care what\u2019s going on down there, I don\u2019t want to go over there,\u2019\u2009\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAnd things would break because you didn\u2019t use it . . . Because you didn\u2019t turn it on, now the light is flickering.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s too big of a house,\u201d Colbert agreed.\nAdvertisement \u201cI didn\u2019t need it . . .

Its investors include venture capital firms Eight Roads, Shenzhen Capital Group, SIG, and Vertex Ventures \u2013 a unit of Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth manager Temasek.\nHaici plans a further US$30 million to US$50 million in private fundraising, Min said without specifying a timeline.

Sign up here.\nGlobal growth has lost momentum since the start of the year, leaving the world economy in a \u201cprecarious\u201d position, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said.\nThe global economy has weakened since the International Monetary Fund last updated its forecast in late January, though a recession isn\u2019t likely in the near term, Lagarde said Tuesday in remarks prepared for a speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington.\nLagarde characterized the slowdown as a \u201csynchronized deceleration\u201d during a panel discussion after her speech.\nIn January, the fund lowered its projection for world economic growth, forecasting expansion of 3.5 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2020. It was the IMF\u2019s second cut in the outlook in three months. The fund will release its new World Economic Outlook with an updated growth forecast on April 9.\n\u201cThe global economy is at a \u2018delicate moment,\u2019\u201d Lagarde said in her speech.\nHer warning comes as global finance ministers and central bankers prepare to convene in Washington next week for the semi-annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank. While confidence has been boosted by the Federal Reserve\u2019s switch to a more patient stance and signs of a trade deal between the U.S. and China, investors remain concerned the global expansion may be running out of steam a decade after the financial crisis.\nRate Patience\nLagarde said the global economy is set to benefit from the patience of major central banks, as well as increased stimulus by the Chinese government. The IMF predicts global growth will pick up \u201csome\u201d in the second half of 2019 and into 2020, she said.\nStill, that rebound remains vulnerable to a host of risks, including Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, high debt in some sectors and countries, trade tensions and \u201ca sense of unease in financial markets,\u201d Lagarde said.\nGiven the state of the global economy, it\u2019s important for policy makers to avoid missteps, she said. Monetary policy should remain accommodative where inflation is below target, while exchange-rate flexibility should be used as needed, according to Lagarde. Regulatory reforms aimed at strengthening the financial sector should continue, she added.\nHigh public debt and low interest rates have left \u201climited room to act when the next downturn comes, which inevitably it will,\u201d she said. \u201cFor many countries, this implies making smarter use of fiscal policy.\u201d\nThe market power of corporations has been increasing, with the highest price markups being imposed by a \u201csmall number of highly dynamic companies,\u201d a trend that is especially pronounced in the digital economy, Lagarde said.\nMarket Power\n\u201cI am not saying that we currently have a \u2018monopoly problem.\u2019 But I am saying that we should take appropriate measures -- so that it does not become a problem,\u201d she said.\nLagarde reiterated her warning for countries to avoid imposing new tariffs on each other. An increase in tariffs by 25 percentage points on all goods traded between the U.S. and China would reduce annual output in the U.S. by up to 0.6 percent, and up to 1.5 percent in China, she said.\n\u201cThese are potentially self-inflicted wounds that should be avoided,\u201d Lagarde said.\nHigh-level trade talks between the U.S. and China resume this week in Washington amid hopes the world\u2019s two biggest economies can reach a deal to end their trade war.\n(Updates with Lagarde comment in third paragraph.)\nLagarde Says Global Economy Has Lost Momentum Since January", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://invst.ly/ag0hu", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=179222828858436&u=https%3A%2F%2Fin.investing.com%2Fnews%2Feconomy-news%2Flagarde-says-global-economy-has-lost-momentum-since-january-1518713&display=popup&ref=plugin", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fin.investing.com%2Fnews%2Feconomy-news%2Flagarde-says-global-economy-has-lost-momentum-since-january-1518713&title=Lagarde+Says+Global+Economy+Has+Lost+Momentum+Since+January&summary="], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lagarde", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "justin chin/bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "christine lagarde", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "stephanomics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephanie flanders", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "imf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international monetary fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. chamber of commerce", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T04:20:53.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "547542f882c0ed55b2a06c1a87d5fb0d396665a8", "url": "http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/04/02/cent-put-his-opulent-connecticut-mansion-market-years-ago-just-sold-for-fraction-asking-price/K3shmc5t3uU1mIVmJXr06K/story.html", "site_full": "www.bostonglobe.com", "site": "bostonglobe.com", "site_section": "http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/technology?p1=BGHeader", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Business/Technology - The Boston Globe", "title": "After 12 years, 50 Cent has finally sold his Conn. mansion.

By Jaclyn Reiss Globe Staff April 02, 2019\nAfter sitting on the market for 12 years, rapper 50 Cent\u2019s 50,000-square-foot mansion in Farmington, Conn., has finally sold \u2014 for millions of dollars below the original asking price.\nThe opulent 19-bedroom, 25-bathroom home at 50 Poplar Hill Drive (we see what you did there, Fiddy) was originally listed for $18.5 million in 2007. However, a deal was recently brokered by Jennifer Leahy of Douglas Elliman Real Estate for $2.9 million.\nOf course, this isn\u2019t just your run-of-the-mill mansion. Set on 17 acres, the estate has \u201ca substantial night club,\u201d multiple game rooms, an indoor court, a green-screen room, a recording studio, a full gym, a home theater, a conference room, a pool \u201cgrotto,\u201d separate guest houses, a basketball court, and landscaped gardens.\nAdvertisement \u201cIt is one of the few homes in Connecticut that have approved grounds for landing a helicopter which makes for easy access from/to New York City,\u201d a listing from Douglas Elliman stated.\nGet Metro Headlines in your inbox: The 10 top local news stories from metro Boston and around New England delivered daily.

Sign up for more newsletters here The sale was reported by The Wall Street Journal on Monday.\nThe rapper, whose real name is Curtis James Jackson III, purchased the mansion in 2004 from boxer Mike Tyson for $4.1 million, and then sank millions of dollars into it for renovations, according to the Associated Press.\nThe Journal reported that the house was costing Jackson about $70,000 a month, citing documents related to the rapper\u2019s 2015 bankruptcy filing. The sale\u2019s proceeds would be donated to the rapper\u2019s nonprofit, G-Unity Foundation Inc , the Journal reported.\nIn an interview with the Hartford Courant, Leahy, the listing agent, declined to name the buyer. Leahy could not immediately be reached by the Globe for comment.\nDouglas Elliman Real Estate\nAdvertisement In a January appearance on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\u201d the rapper talked a bit about why he didn\u2019t want the house anymore.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a big house no more. I experienced that with the Tyson mansion,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cYou look down the hallway, and you go \u2014 [you know] whenever you look down a hallway in your house and you don\u2019t want to go down there?\u201d\nColbert cracked up before asking, \u201cBecause it\u2019s so long?\u201d\n\u201cYou go, \u2018I don\u2019t care what\u2019s going on down there, I don\u2019t want to go over there,\u2019\u2009\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAnd things would break because you didn\u2019t use it . . . Because you didn\u2019t turn it on, now the light is flickering.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s too big of a house,\u201d Colbert agreed.\nAdvertisement \u201cI didn\u2019t need it . . .

That was partly offset by an increase in plan liabilities.\nAon senior partner William da Silva said overall conditions have improved dramatically over the past three to five years, and many plans are fully funded or close to fully funded.\n\u201cI think beneficiaries can feel much more comfortable about having financial assets backing the promises that were made to them in the DB plans,\u201d da Silva said.\nThe Aon Median Solvency Ratio rose to 98.5 per cent as of March 31, The ratio indicates that half of the plans had at least enough assets to cover 98.5 per cent of their liabilities, up from 95.3 per cent as of Jan. 1.\n From the perspective of plan sponsors, da Silva said, the improved funded status will allow them to move assets from unpredictable stocks markets to the safety of interest-bearing assets such as bonds.\n\u201cHopefully, most organizations have started to de-risk (by moving out of stocks) so that if there is a downturn, (they\u2019re) not going to be whacked as bad as in the past,\u201d da Silva said.\nAndrew Whale, of Mercer Canada\u2019s Financial Strategy Group, said plan sponsors are concerned about the volatility of markets because of the impact on both the pension plans and the financial statements of the overall business.\n\u201cAs a beneficiary looking at the health of a plan, it\u2019s always important to view not only the health of the pension plan but the health of the plan sponsor, the former employer as well . . . so they can afford to withstand the volatility.\u201d\nDefined pension plans can sometimes put significant financial stress on employers, since they are legally obligated to provide an agreed-upon level of benefits for retirees even when investment markets do poorly.\nMercer estimates nearly half of the defined benefit plans in its universe are fully funded and the firm is encouraging such clients to take investment risks off the table, Whale said in an interview.\nThe Mercer Pension Health Index\u2019s stood at 106 per cent at March 31, meaning that a hypothetical plan that\u2019s used as a benchmark would have enough assets to cover 106 per cent of liabilities.

The fund will release its new World Economic Outlook with an updated growth forecast on April 9.\n \u201cThe global economy is at a \u2018delicate moment,\u2019\u201d Lagarde said in her speech.\nHer warning comes as global finance ministers and central bankers prepare to convene in Washington next week for the semi-annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank. While confidence has been boosted by the Federal Reserve\u2019s switch to a more patient stance and signs of a trade deal between the U.S. and China, investors remain concerned the global expansion may be running out of steam a decade after the financial crisis.\nLagarde said the global economy is set to benefit from the patience of major central banks, as well as increased stimulus by the Chinese government. The IMF predicts global growth will pick up \u201csome\u201d in the second half of 2019 and into 2020, she said.\nStill, that rebound remains vulnerable to a host of risks, including Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, high debt in some sectors and countries, trade tensions and \u201ca sense of unease in financial markets,\u201d Lagarde said.\nGiven the state of the global economy, it\u2019s important for policy-makers to avoid missteps, she said.\nMonetary policy should remain accommodative where inflation is below target, while exchange-rate flexibility should be used as needed, according to Lagarde. Regulatory reforms aimed at strengthening the financial sector should continue, she added.\nHigh public debt and low interest rates have left \u201climited room to act when the next downturn comes, which inevitably it will,\u201d she said. \u201cFor many countries, this implies making smarter use of fiscal policy.\u201d\n The market power of corporations has been increasing, with the highest price markups being imposed by a \u201csmall number of highly dynamic companies,\u201d a trend that is especially pronounced in the digital economy, Lagarde said.\n\u201cI am not saying that we currently have a \u2018monopoly problem.\u2019 But I am saying that we should take appropriate measures \u2014 so that it does not become a problem,\u201d she said.\nLagarde reiterated her warning for countries to avoid imposing new tariffs on each other. An increase in tariffs by 25 percentage points on all goods traded between the U.S. and China would reduce annual output in the U.S. by up to 0.6 per cent, and up to 1.5 per cent in China, she said.\n\u201cThese are potentially self-inflicted wounds that should be avoided,\u201d Lagarde said.\nHigh-level trade talks between the U.S. and China resume this week in Washington amid hopes the world\u2019s two biggest economies can reach a deal to end their trade war.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrew mayeda bloomberg washingt", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lagarde", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "olivier douliery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine lagarde", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "imf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international monetary fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. chamber of commerce", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T05:08:41.152+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "72dc172974c4c6c71a297d114473af4b30ab2f61", "url": "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/us/2019/04/02/new-mexico-seeks-bigger-slice-of-outdoor-recreation-economy.html", "site_full": "www.thestar.com", "site": "thestar.com", "site_section": "https://www.thestar.com/news/world.html", "site_categories": ["media", "hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "World News | International News | The Star", "title": "New Mexico seeks bigger slice of outdoor recreation economy", "title_full": "New Mexico seeks bigger slice of outdoor recreation economy | The Star", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "https://images.thestar.com/4vnvO_f50aPSEvb1YLsiKM3rAlI=/1280x1024/smart/filters:cb(1554258517359)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/us/2019/04/02/new-mexico-seeks-bigger-slice-of-outdoor-recreation-economy/RPML201-42_2019_154250.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3654, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "72dc172974c4c6c71a297d114473af4b30ab2f61", "url": "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/us/2019/04/02/new-mexico-seeks-bigger-slice-of-outdoor-recreation-economy.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Morgan Lee", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "New Mexico seeks bigger slice of outdoor recreation economy", "text": "New Mexico seeks bigger slice of outdoor recreation economy By Morgan Lee The Associated Press Tues., April 2, 2019\nSANTA FE, N.M. - New Mexico will seek out a bigger share of the nation\u2019s outdoor recreation economy by creating a special division dedicated to expanding the state\u2019s foothold in the lucrative industry.\nAt a state park in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed legislation that creates a special outdoor recreation division. The plan takes cues from other states in the West such as Colorado that actively promote outdoor adventure as an engine of economic development and a resource for public health and consciousness about natural wonders. New Mexico Economic Development Secretary Alicia Keyes announced the creation of an outdoor recreation division on Tuesday, April 2, 2019, in Hyde Memorial State Park outside Santa Fe, N.M. Gov.

2019\nCALGARY\u2014People are slowly starting to return to the core after an economic downturn spurred companies to vacate their downtown digs, leaving almost a third of office spaces empty last year.\nAccording to new numbers from commercial real estate and investment firm CBRE, the first-quarter vacancy rate was 26.5 per cent, bolstered by companies starting to move toward higher-end buildings due to more affordable rents. According to new numbers from commercial real estate and investment firm CBRE, the first-quarter vacancy rate was 26.5 per cent, bolstered by companies starting to move toward higher-end buildings due to more affordable rents. ( Christina Ryan / Star Calgay Star Metro )\nThat\u2019s compared to the middle of 2018, when vacancy rates peaked at 27.8 per cent.\n\u201cThe main point is the free fall into higher vacancies has hopefully stopped,\u201d said Greg Kwong, the Alberta regional managing director of CBRE, which curates statistics in the commercial real estate industry. He added that there was also some positive leasing absorption this last quarter, meaning there were more spaces being \u201cabsorbed\u201d or leased from the market than the number of spaces added to the market.\nBut it still doesn\u2019t paint a picture of a downtown that has fully bounced back from the economic downturn. Article Continued Below\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re out of the woods,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo things that it points out ... we\u2019ve seen a lot of new buildings being constructed and being delivered to the market over the last three, four years, and that has now stopped.\u201d\nHe also said the mass layoffs that Calgarians saw in the last three or four years have possibly stopped, too.\nBut the buildings aren\u2019t necessarily fill back up. Instead, the numbers point to a shift in the type of buildings that are being rented, Kwong said.\nWhen the numbers are parsed out by building category, which range from Class AA (office towers that are rated as higher-end in terms of quality and amenities) to Class D, the highest tier of buildings are getting more tenants and have lower vacancy rates \u2014 now 16.3 per cent from 20.8 per cent in 2018\u2019s second quarter, while the lower-ranked buildings are experiencing higher vacancy rates.\n\u201cThe story there is that the tenants are doing a flight to quality as rates become more affordable,\u201d he said.\nIn other words, tenants that once were relegated to buildings between Class A to D rankings are now able to afford spaces in more expensive office towers in the class AA category (which accounts for 40 per cent of available office space) that have lowered rental rates.\nBut the lower-ranked buildings from Classes A to D, which account for the rest of free space, could be in trouble when comparing the current numbers to 2018\u2019s second quarter. Article Continued Below\nVacancy rates for Class A and B went up \u2014 only by less than a per cent \u2014 and now sit at 25.2 per cent, and 41.7 per cent, respectively.\nHowever, the numbers tell a more positive story in the industrial sector, where online shopping has added the need for large warehouses in the city.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very strong, good news story for Calgary,\u201d Kwong said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got major retailers like Walmart, Lowe\u2019s, Home Depot, Amazon, all opening up ... 500,000- to a million-square-foot warehouses because we are logistically the best location to set up shop,\u201d Kwong said.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s still hurting in the industrial sector are the small spaces (5,000 square feet or less) because those are traditionally occupied by \u2018Joe Welder\u2019 and \u2018Suzy Pipefitter\u2019 and all these companies that serviced the oil and gas business, (but) they\u2019re all gone right now there\u2019s just no business for them.\u201d\nAmy Tucker is a reporter/photographer with Star Calgary.

The Aussie was last up 0.3 percent at $0.7093.\nThe currency was earlier nursing losses from the previous day after RBA held interest rates steady at a record low 1.50 percent but managed to sound dovish to some.\nFebruary's strong number reduces the risk of another weak quarter of economic expansion after gross domestic product data for the quarter ended December came in surprisingly softer at 0.2 percent.\nHousehold spending accounts for around 57 percent of Australia's annual GDP.\nTo help Australians tide over snail-paced wages growth and high debt, the country's conservative government on Tuesday announced sweeping tax cuts and offered cash handouts to some.\nThat might also provide some timely support for Australia's struggling retail sector as weak spending has hit some of the country's biggest businesses. Earlier this week, top grocer Woolworths said it will shut about a sixth of its loss-making discount department stores over the next three years.\nIts rivals Kmart and Target - owned by Wesfarmers - aren't doing much better either as they reported declining first-half earnings.\nEconomists expect Tuesday's budget measures will likely lift consumer sentiment and spending. TD Securities analyst Annette Beacher said the \"targetted fiscal stimulus\" in the budget - which includes A$15 billion worth of tax cuts over 2021/22 - negates the need for the RBA to ease policy for now.\nSeparate data showed Australia's exporters were enjoying boom times as the country's trade surplus swelled beyond all expectations to A$4.8 billion ($3.4 billion) in February and owed much to a surge in iron ore exports. Economist had forecast a surplus of A$3.8 billion.\nThe upbeat trade and retail sales figures should also provide some relief to policymakers worried about a slowdown in China, Australia's major export market.\n($1 = 1.4104 Australian dollars)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://player.powr.com/player.min.js", "https://api.trkd.thomsonreuters.com/api/topnews/topnews-images/2018-10-31T015603Z_2031266042_RC1BEEB3DD40_RTRMADP_2_AUSTRALIA-ECONOMY-INFLATION.JPG.ashx"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kaixin owyong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swati pandey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters feb", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reserve bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australian bureau of statistics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national australia bank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T06:34:03.036+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "44236ef46774f19371d73122183b15ff5df8a0af", "url": "https://za.investing.com/news/economy-news/lagarde-says-global-economy-has-lost-momentum-since-january-1441439", "site_full": "za.investing.com", "site": "investing.com", "site_section": "https://za.investing.com/news/economy-news", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Economic News - Investing.com ZA", "title": "Lagarde Says Global Economy Has Lost Momentum Since January By Bloomberg", "title_full": "Lagarde Says Global Economy Has Lost Momentum Since January By Bloomberg", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic9c456fc4bf2712200c17806b0053acb0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 699, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "44236ef46774f19371d73122183b15ff5df8a0af", "url": "https://za.investing.com/news/economy-news/lagarde-says-global-economy-has-lost-momentum-since-january-1441439", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bloomberg", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Lagarde Says Global Economy Has Lost Momentum Since January By Bloomberg", "text": "\u00a9 Bloomberg. Christine Lagarde Photographer: Justin Chin/Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Go inside the global economy with Stephanie Flanders in her new podcast, Stephanomics. Sign up here.\nGlobal growth has lost momentum since the start of the year, leaving the world economy in a \u201cprecarious\u201d position, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said.\nThe global economy has weakened since the International Monetary Fund last updated its forecast in late January, though a recession isn\u2019t likely in the near term, Lagarde said Tuesday in remarks prepared for a speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington.\nLagarde characterized the slowdown as a \u201csynchronized deceleration\u201d during a panel discussion after her speech.\nIn January, the fund lowered its projection for world economic growth, forecasting expansion of 3.5 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2020. It was the IMF\u2019s second cut in the outlook in three months. The fund will release its new World Economic Outlook with an updated growth forecast on April 9.\n\u201cThe global economy is at a \u2018delicate moment,\u2019\u201d Lagarde said in her speech.\nHer warning comes as global finance ministers and central bankers prepare to convene in Washington next week for the semi-annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank. While confidence has been boosted by the Federal Reserve\u2019s switch to a more patient stance and signs of a trade deal between the U.S. and China, investors remain concerned the global expansion may be running out of steam a decade after the financial crisis.\nRate Patience\nLagarde said the global economy is set to benefit from the patience of major central banks, as well as increased stimulus by the Chinese government. The IMF predicts global growth will pick up \u201csome\u201d in the second half of 2019 and into 2020, she said.\nStill, that rebound remains vulnerable to a host of risks, including Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, high debt in some sectors and countries, trade tensions and \u201ca sense of unease in financial markets,\u201d Lagarde said.\nGiven the state of the global economy, it\u2019s important for policy makers to avoid missteps, she said. Monetary policy should remain accommodative where inflation is below target, while exchange-rate flexibility should be used as needed, according to Lagarde. Regulatory reforms aimed at strengthening the financial sector should continue, she added.\nHigh public debt and low interest rates have left \u201climited room to act when the next downturn comes, which inevitably it will,\u201d she said. \u201cFor many countries, this implies making smarter use of fiscal policy.\u201d\nThe market power of corporations has been increasing, with the highest price markups being imposed by a \u201csmall number of highly dynamic companies,\u201d a trend that is especially pronounced in the digital economy, Lagarde said.\nMarket Power\n\u201cI am not saying that we currently have a \u2018monopoly problem.\u2019 But I am saying that we should take appropriate measures -- so that it does not become a problem,\u201d she said.\nLagarde reiterated her warning for countries to avoid imposing new tariffs on each other. An increase in tariffs by 25 percentage points on all goods traded between the U.S. and China would reduce annual output in the U.S. by up to 0.6 percent, and up to 1.5 percent in China, she said.\n\u201cThese are potentially self-inflicted wounds that should be avoided,\u201d Lagarde said.\nHigh-level trade talks between the U.S. and China resume this week in Washington amid hopes the world\u2019s two biggest economies can reach a deal to end their trade war.\n(Updates with Lagarde comment in third paragraph.)\nLagarde Says Global Economy Has Lost Momentum Since January", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=179222828858436&u=https%3A%2F%2Fza.investing.com%2Fnews%2Feconomy-news%2Flagarde-says-global-economy-has-lost-momentum-since-january-1441439&display=popup&ref=plugin", "https://invst.ly/ag0hp", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fza.investing.com%2Fnews%2Feconomy-news%2Flagarde-says-global-economy-has-lost-momentum-since-january-1441439&title=Lagarde+Says+Global+Economy+Has+Lost+Momentum+Since+January&summary="], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lagarde", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "justin chin/bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "christine lagarde", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "stephanomics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephanie flanders", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg \u00a9 bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "imf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international monetary fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. chamber of commerce", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T07:52:20.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8ee25862e90a20572b9fafd625b21aa49dae9956", "url": "https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/368659/square-sq-outpaces-stock-market-gains-what-you-should-know", "site_full": "www.zacks.com", "site": "zacks.com", "site_section": "http://feed.zacks.com/commentary/AllStories/rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance", "mutual_funds"], "section_title": "Zacks Investment Research - All Commentary Articles", "title": "Square (SQ) Outpaces Stock Market Gains: What You Should Know", "title_full": "Square (SQ) Outpaces Stock Market Gains: What You Should Know", "published": "2019-04-02T00:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/default_article_images/default320.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8414, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8ee25862e90a20572b9fafd625b21aa49dae9956", "url": "https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/368659/square-sq-outpaces-stock-market-gains-what-you-should-know", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Zacks Equity Research", "published": "2019-04-02T00:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Square (SQ) Outpaces Stock Market Gains: What You Should Know", "text": "You follow Tale of the Tape - edit You follow Zacks Equity Research - edit What would you like to follow?

For both the indices, this was the highest growth in any fiscal since FY 2009-10.\nHowever, the gains were capped as crude oil prices rose and fears over a tariff war-induced global slowdown grew.\nOn March 29, the last trading day of FY 2018-19, Sensex rose 127 points to close at 38,672.91 and the Nifty50 settled at 11,623.90 points, higher by 53.90 points from its previous close.\nOn sectoral basis, the banks, energy and IT sector outperformed with a growth of 25 per cent followed by FMCG at 16 per cent and Pharma at 12 per cent. While the laggards were led by media at (-) 24 per cent, auto (-) 23 per cent and telecom (-) 22 per cent.\n\"Despite a volatile year due to US- China trade tensions, liquidity crisis and NBFCs, India- Pakistan border tension, the Nifty50 rallied by 14.9 per cent and BSE Sensex was higher by 16.9 per cent in FY19,\" said Shivendra Foujdar, Founder and Managing Partner, Avighna Trades.\nThe year was marked by several issues starting from high crude oil prices, rupee faltering to new record lows, liquidity crisis in the non-banking financial companies (NBFC), US- China trade tensions, delay in Brexit breakthrough among others.\nAmar Pandit, founder of HappynessFactory. in a wealth-tech platform said that the market witnessed a correction in September-October after the NBFC crisis came to light as IL&FS defaulted in September.\nHe noted that recapitalisation of state-run banks which were under stress was a major boost for the markets.\nAlong with recapitalisation of PSBs, eventual easing of liquidity concerns, and a sustained rise in foreign fund inflows also supported the market, according to analysts.\nExpectations of the incumbent government coming back to power further boosted the investor sentiments.\nIncrease in interest rates globally, however, was major concern for the Indian market cited Mustafa Nadeem of Epic Research.\n\"The important factor that changed the overall scenario in FY19 was the rising interest rates in global markets specifically that by the Federal Reserve,\" Nadeem said.\n\"Hence the liquidity that was there available easily was being sucked out and capital outflow was seen. So it was a year more of consolidation.\"\nThe inflow of domestic funds however made up for it, analysts said. Foujdar said: \"Even when Nifty was seen losing the benchmark of 10,000 points, the DIIs flow kept supporting the market making Bank Nifty and IT rose close to 25 per cent during the just concluded fiscal,\" he said.\nStock-wise, Bajaj Finance, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the top gainers with a gain of 71 per cent, 54 per cent and 52 per cent in FY2018-19.

Agarwal's death\nAccusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of \"monumental mismanagement\" of the economy, the Congress on Saturday said his \"reckless decisions\", including that of demonetisation and the hasty implementation of a \"flawed\" GST, had turned it into a \"gasping\" and \"struggling\" economy instead of a \"galloping\" economy.\n\"The fact is that there has been monumental mismanagement of the Indian economy under his (Modi's) watch. It is not a galloping economy, it is a gasping economy, a struggling economy. The Indian economy has also suffered because of the reckless decisions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, especially demonetisation,\" Congress leader Anand Sharma said in a press conference.\nHe said that Modi would have to give an account of what he did to the economy and how \"tens of millions of jobs were destroyed\" by his government post demonetisation.\nSharma added that time has come to punish Modi and his government for mismanaging the economy and \"destroying the credibility of Indian data\".\n\" Narendra Modi had made certain promises to the people of India. A betrayed nation is now questioning his betrayal, non-performance, non-delivery and non-creation of two crore jobs per year which has actually put a dark shadow over the future of our young people and their aspirations.\n\"The farmers are now asking questions about the non-fulfilment of the government's commitment to give 1-1/2 times the price as per the cost of the produce,\" Sharma said.\nHe added that the Prime Minister was \"running scared\" of the real issues but the Congress was determined not to allow him to get away.\n\"It is important that the Prime Minister comes back to the real issues. We are making it absolutely clear that the Congress will not allow the Prime Minister to hijack the narrative by talking about non-issues and playing with the people's emotions,\" the Congress leader said.\n--IANS\nvv/arm (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

First is to guarantee a minimum income to the bottom 20 per cent families. The second is to remonetise the economy that has been demonetised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gandhi told PTI.\nSenior Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram on Wednesday said 'enough' economists and experts had been consulted and they broadly agreed that India has the capacity to implement the scheme.\nFormer RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has said the implementation of the scheme is possible, Chidambaram said.\n\"Our calculation shows that it will not cross 2 per cent of the GDP, it will be 1.8 per cent of the GDP at any given point of time,\" he said.\nCommenting on the scheme, Panagariya said the transfer is meant to be Rs 6,000 per month per family to 50 million families and at the same time, it also guarantees an income of Rs 12,000 per month to these families.\n\"What happens if one family has an income of only Rs 4,000 and another Rs 8,000 per month? Will the former then receive Rs 8,000 and the latter Rs 4,000 per month? If so, why should anyone with income below 12,000 do any work at all since their incomes will be Rs 12,000 regardless of what they earn?\" he asked.\nInterpreted this way, \"there is a serious incentive problem with the scheme\", Panagariya asserted.\n\"If the scheme is meant to transfer flat Rs 6,000 per month to identified families regardless of the family's earned income, you cannot deliver Rs 12,000 per month to families earning less than Rs 6,000,\" he asserted.\nThe programme, as announced by the Congress, guarantees Rs 12,000 per month in income to the poor, which is Rs 144,000 per year, he said, explaining the fairness issue.\nAdd to it all other in-kind transfers: subsidised food, NREGA wages, free house, free toilet, free education and Rs 500,000 free health insurance coverage. The gross sum will be close to Rs 200,000 per year, Panagariya observed.\n\"Now think of someone not covered by the scheme and earning Rs 300,000 per year. This family will have to pay Rs 2,500 in taxes (currently covered by a tax credit but in principle taxable). How fair is this to those working? \"Moreover, taxpayers are all in urban areas and dole recipients all in rural areas. Will this not open a serious rural-urban schism? No one questions helping the destitute on the margin but when help is given to give all comforts of life free, those paying for those comforts will become intensely unhappy,\" he said.\nThen there is the question of fiscal challenge, he said.\nIf Rs 12,000 per month per household is to be guaranteed to bottom 20 per cent of the population, even the average Rs 6,000 per family will be insufficient, he argued.\n\"But let us set that problem aside. Can we scrape Rs 3.6 trillion per year (calculated at Rs 6,000 per family for 50 million households)? There is no chance.\n\"It is 13 per cent of the proposed total central government expenditure in budget 2019-20,\" Panagariya said.\nAnit Mukherjee, a policy fellow at the Center for Global Development where he works on issues of governance, public finance and service delivery in developing countries, said how to identify the target beneficiaries and how to absorb the fiscal impact are two major problems.\nThe amount is substantial, more than the current government has proposed (Rs 6,000 per year), and to a general definition of the poorest of the poor (and not just farmers), he said.\n\"However, it is about half of what a similar scheme in Kenya through a US-based charity GiveDirectly provides to over 20,000 adults purely on a universal basic income criteria,\" Mukherjee said, adding the results of the scheme are still awaited, so there is no firm global evidence on whether Universal Basic Income works or not at the scale which the programme in India would operate on.\nAccording to Mukherjee, to address the problem of fiscal impact, there has to be \"cutbacks\" in other subsidies, principally food, fuel, electricity and fertiliser.\n\"Some transfers to the poorest of the poor, such as MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) and social pensions, would probably have to be absorbed into NYAY,\" Mukherjee told PTI.\nSchemes such as Public Distribution System and MGNREGA are constitutionally mandated and it would be hard to remove them altogether, he said.\nThe Centre, which has struggled to contain the fiscal deficit, will have to foot the entire bill so the fiscal concern is justified, Mukherjee said.

Big-ticket investments were driven by complex deal structures, PE-backed merger and acquisition, later-stage funding and the inflated start-up valuations, it said.\nFurther, the report said it is not unusual to witness high levels of public spending in election years and it may push investments in rural and infrastructure-related sectors in the near term.\nThe core sectors may not get impacted as most mid-market investments take a long-term bet on growth potential, the report said.\nConsequently, PE deal volumes are expected to pick up in the second half of the year with 2020 expected to be the year of the highest volumes of PE investments.\nThe report focuses on the PE and VC industry in India and has been produced in association with the Indian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (IVCA), an organisation that works towards promotion of PE and VC firms.

'Back against the wall' The case is one of more than 11,200 similar cases in the US alone involving Roundup.\nLast August, Monsanto lost a case to a California school groundskeeper suffering from terminal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, who had sued the company over the glyphosate weedkillers Roundup and Ranger Pro.\nMonsanto was initially ordered to pay USD 289 million to Dewayne Johnson, before the damages were reduced to USD 78.5 million.\nBayer has also filed an appeal in that case.\nMonsanto has consistently denied that the weedkiller causes cancer and challenged findings by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, an arm of the World Health Organisation (WHO), which classified glyphosate as a \"probable carcinogen\" in 2015.\nBut other major agencies like the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) or the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have not followed suit.\nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, told AFP that Hardeman's case was \"important as a bellwether, which means it helps predict how future cases will be decided.\" Tobias said the verdict \"bodes well\" for plaintiffs in the thousands of other cases filed against Monsanto, and was \"likely to encourage plaintiffs and their counsel to be more vigorous in pursuing their cases and will lead more potential plaintiffs to file suit.\" The Environmental Working Group, a non-profit organisation, cheered Wednesday's verdict.\n\"Clearly, the testimony that informed the jury's decision was Bayer-Monsanto hiding Roundup's carcinogenic properties, manipulating the science and cozying-up with EPA so it would not have to warn consumers of its dangerous product,\" said the group's president Ken Cook.\n\"This verdict puts Bayer's back firmly up against the wall as the cost of litigation mounts and its stock price gets pummeled once again,\" he added.

It can be triggered by a number of things, including our emotions, neurotransmitters in the brain, or the caffeinated beverages we consume.\nIn this case the researchers wanted to explore how simply being exposed to things that remind us of coffee may have an effect on arousal.\nAcross four separate studies and using a mix of participants from western and eastern cultures, they compared coffee- and tea-related cues. They found that participants exposed to coffee-related cues perceived time as shorter and thought in more concrete, precise terms.\n\"People who experience physiological arousal -- again, in this case as the result of priming and not drinking coffee itself -- see the world in more specific, detailed terms,\" said Maglio.\n\"This has a number of implications for how people process information and make judgments and decisions,\" he said.\nHowever, the effect was not as strong among participants who grew up in eastern cultures. Maglio speculates that the association between coffee and arousal is not as strong in less coffee-dominated cultures.\nNext steps for the research will look at associations people have for different foods and beverages, researchers said. Just thinking about energy drinks or red wine, for example, could have very different effects on arousal.

Will the positive momentum continue on Tuesday? Currently, the pair is trading at 1.3316, up 0.07% on the day. On the release front, there are no Canadian events. In the U.S., core durable goods orders is expected to improve to 0.3%, while durable goods orders is forecast to plunge 1.1%. On Wednesday, the U.S. publishes ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI and ADP (NASDAQ: ADP ) nonfarm payrolls.\nThe Canadian dollar ended last week with strong gains, as Canada\u2019s GDP posted a gain of 0.3% in January. This beat the estimate and came after two successive declines, which has raised concerns about the health of the Canadian economy. The slowdown in the fourth quarter has forced the Bank of Canada to turn more dovish and shelve any plans of hiking interest rates. There have even been calls for a rate cut from the bank, but the GDP gain in January will lessen the pressure on the BoC to stimulate the economy.\nPositive data out of China this week has also boosted the fortunes of the Canadian dollar. Investor risk appetite has risen following a key manufacturing report that was better than expected. Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI improved to 50.8, easily beating the estimate of 50.1 points. Investors cheered as the indicator climbed to an 8-month high, after three successive readings in contraction territory. The Chinese economy has been hit hard by the trade war with the U.S., and a piece of good news sparked strong gains on the equity markets and boosted the Canadian dollar.\nUSD/CAD Fundamentals\nWednesday (April 3)\n8:15 US ADP Nonfarm Employment Change.

In January, it had trimmed its forecast for global growth to around 3.5% for this year and next year, based on the headwinds caused by rising trade tensions, the uncertainty surrounding Britain\u2019s planned exit from the European Union and tighter financial conditions, including the Fed\u2019s four rate hikes last year.\nREAD MORE: How the U.S.-China trade war could damage the Amazon rainforest\nLagarde said that all of those factors had resulted in a dramatic reversal in prospects for many countries. Just two years ago, she said, 75% of the global economy was experiencing an upswing in growth. But this year, the IMF is forecasting that about 70% of the global economy will be experiencing a slowdown in growth.\nMany private economists believe that the United States, the world\u2019s largest economy, will see growth slow from an annual gain of 2.9% in 2018 to just above 2% in 2019 as the stimulus from tax cuts and higher government spending begins to fade. \u201cNobody wins a trade war.\u201d\nLagarde said new IMF research shows that an increase in tariffs of 25 percentage points on all goods traded between the United States and China would reduce growth in the United States by up to 0.6% and trim growth in China by as much as 1.6%.\n\u201cNobody wins a trade war,\u201d Lagarde said. \u201cThat is why we need to work together to reduce trade barriers and modernize the global trade system so that we all win.\u201d\nNegotiators from the United States and China were scheduled to meet in Washington this week in an effort to resolve differences and avoid further penalty tariffs being imposed by both nations.\nLagarde\u2019s address was a preview of the issues expected to be addressed during the spring meetings of the IMF and its sister lending organization, the World Bank, taking place in Washington next week.

Other potential risks cited include: the impact of the economy (42 percent), innovations disrupting their organization\u2019s business model (40 percent), shifts in consumer and social demographics (34 percent) and social media harming the organization\u2019s reputation and brand (30 percent).\nMost (59 percent) senior finance leaders also agreed that the volume and complexity of corporate risks have changed \u201cmostly\u201d or \u201cextensively\u201d over the last five years. Despite this, a majority (69 percent) said their organizations do not have complete ERM processes in place, and less than a quarter (23 percent) would rate their organization\u2019s overall risk management oversight as \u201cmature\u201d or \u201crobust.\u201d The report did find indications, however, that adoption of ERM processes in the U.S. is on the rise. Over the last decade, the number of organizations that claim to have complete ERM processes in place has increased 22 percentage points, from 9 percent to 31 percent.\n\u201cWhile most executives perceive that uncertainties in the business environment are leading to more complex risk challenges for their organizations, few executives describe their organization\u2019s approach to risk management as mature or robust,\u201d says Mark Beasley, professor of enterprise risk management and accounting in NC State\u2019s Poole College of Management and director of NC State\u2019s ERM Initiative.\n\u201cThat may be changing, given the majority of organizations have external stakeholders and boards of directors who are calling for more extensive management involvement in risk oversight,\u201d Beasley says.\n\u201cIn this environment of unprecedented levels of risk, CFOs must take the lead and guide their organizations to approach, evaluate and mitigate risk in a very systematic way,\u201d says Ash Noah, CPA, CGMA, managing director of CGMA Learning, Education and Development at AICPA. \u201cERM provides organizations with a way to create and maximize value for their shareholders and stakeholders, ensuring the long-term viability of the business.\u201d\nOther key findings from the survey include: There is a growing demand for Chief Risk Officers (CROs). The percentage of organizations that have formally designated individuals serving as CROs has more than doubled since 2009, from 18 percent to 50 percent. Management wants a greater focus on risk. Over the last decade, the number of organizations with management-level risk committees has increased 43 percentage points, from 22 percent to 65 percent. There is a disconnect between risk and strategy. Less than 20 percent of organizations view their risk management processes as providing important strategic advantage, and only 26 percent say their boards of directors discuss risk exposures when they discuss the organization\u2019s strategic plan. The survey also asked respondents to share perceived barriers to implementing enterprise-wide risk management processes in their organizations. Reasons cited include: believing risk was monitored in other ways besides for ERM (51 percent), competing priorities (49 percent) and insufficient resources (46 percent).

The quote gradually recovered from 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of it September \u2013 November rise but couldn\u2019t clear 50-day simple moving average (SMA) during its recent journey. 100-day SMA level of 0.9960 can act as immediate support for the pair ahead of dragging it to 0.9930 and 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of 0.9900.

The pair trade mute during Asian and European hours around the 1.1200 level, with the common currency unable to attract investors whatever the market mood was at the time. In the data front, the EU released February PPI, which rose by 0.1% MoM as expected, and by 3.0% YoY, this last, missing the market's expectations.

The less volatile ex-transportation measure was up by a measly 0.1% MoM, while on a year-on-year basis growth cooled to 3.3%, while the most-relevant nondefense ex-aircraft figure declined by 0.1% MoM.

Sterling soared in the US afternoon after PM May offered a cross-party approach to Brexit.\nThe GBP/USD pair trimmed its intraday losses and settled above 1.3100 after bottoming for the day at 1.3012. The Sterling came under selling pressure early London following the release of the UK Markit Construction PMI, down in March to 49.7, better than the previous 49.5 but below the market's forecast of 49.8. Brexit headlines kept coming, with the Pound up mid-US afternoon, after PM May made a statement following a cabinet meeting at Downing Street. Mrs. May said that a further extension is needed, aiming to leave the EU by May 22nd. She added that she is 'taking action to break the logjam,' and wants Corbyn to agree with her withdrawal agreement and on changes to the future relationship, offering a cross-party approach. Seems unlikely Corbyn will change his mind and support May, but rather keep seeking for an election. Meanwhile, MPs are focused on preventing a hard-Brexit, and will likely meet this week for another round of indicative votes. There were also some headlines indicating a possible emergency plan to pass a bill meant to stop a no-deal Brexit through an extension of Art. 50. The UK will see the release of the Markit Services PMI for March, foreseen at 50.9 vs. the previous 51.3.\nNow trading at around 1.3120, the 4 hours chart shows that the pair surpassed its 20 SMA, now flat at around 1.3050, while the price is challenging an also directionless 200 EMA. Technical indicators re-entered positive ground, with the Momentum lacking directional strength but the RSI maintaining its upward slope, in line with further gains ahead, to be confirmed on a break above the weekly high of 1.3149.\nSupport levels: 1.3085 1.3040 1.2990\nResistance levels: 1.3150 1.3200 1.3245\nView Live Chart for the GBP/USD\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Activity in the services sector to highlight Wednesday, with updates for all major economies. The USD/JPY pair ended the day unchanged in the 111.30 price zone, having spent the day consolidating Monday gains. The absence of relevant macroeconomic news coming from Japan at the beginning of the day and the poor performance of Asian equities kept the pair ranging, while later on the day, dollar's strength offset equities' declines. In the meantime, US Treasury yields eased just modestly, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note spending the day in the 2.47/9% range. Early Wednesday, the Japanese Nikkei Services PMI is expected to come in at 52.1, slightly below the previous 52.3. Local share markets may follow the lead of Wall Street in its way lower and somehow pressure the pair. The daily chart shows that, for a second consecutive day, the pair was unable to surpass a flat 200 DMA at around 111.45, holding, however, above the longer ones. The pair also held above the 61.8% retracement of its March slide at around 111.20. The 4 hours offers a neutral-to-bullish stance as the pair keeps developing above all of its moving averages, and with the 20 SMA crossing above the larger ones, while technical indicators eased just modestly within positive levels.\nSupport levels: 111.20 110.90 111.55\nResistance levels: 111.70 112.05 112.40 View Live Chart for the USD/JPY\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

On the other hand, the consensus forecasts are calling for Australia's February month balance of trade to flash a soft figure of $3.8 billion AUD, down from the last reading of AUD 4,549 million. The Australian exports in January last came in at +5.0%, while Imports for the same period arrived at +3.0%.\nWhile latest reports on retail sales and trade balance were positive, various banks have their own forecasts for the current data ahead of the release.\nWestpac seems upbeat on trade balance but not the same while looking at retail sales. It says,\nConsensus is for a pickup to 0.3%mth in Feb but Westpac is on a gloomy -0.1%, given poor consumer sentiment, including survey detail showing elevated risk aversion. The industry breakdown in Jan also concerned us, with poor sales in discretionary categories.\nAustralia\u2019s trade balance is a much more positive story. Dec 2018 and Jan 2019 were the second- and third-largest surpluses on record, with Jan A$4.5bn. We look for -0.9%mth on exports, as falls in gold and coal offset gains for iron ore, while imports may have risen 1.1%, led by fuel. This would trim the surplus to a still historically very large $3.8bn. The median forecast is $3.7bn.\nOn the other hand, TD Securities has its own belief as follows:\nRetail sales are expected to lift by 0.2%. After the recent Dec qtr private consumption report revealed that spending tended to be on services and no net spending on goods, we don\u2019t expect a lot of growth in this report. The February trade surplus is expected to be relatively steady at +$A4.9b. We expected exports to correct by -1.5%/m after the surprise blockbuster +6.2%/m in Jan, while imports pullback by a decent -3%/m taking the signal from the Chinese trade report, showing a holiday slump in exports to Australia in February (that is not quite seasonally adjusted away).\nHow could they affect the AUD/USD?\nWhile recently positive data from China and optimism surrounding the US-China trade deal haven\u2019t been highlighted by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), traders might take serious note of the scheduled data if negative outcomes arrive.\nTechnically, the AUD/USD pair can take rest around 0.7050 in case of soft data but further weakness beneath the same support could drag the quote towards 0.7015 and 0.6980 important rest-points. Alternatively, 0.7075 and 50-day simple moving average (SMA) around 0.7120 can act as immediate resistances for the buyers to watch in case of positive data.\nKey Notes\nAUD/USD Analysis: RBA weighed the Aussie, China can save it\nAbout the Australian retail sales\nThe Retail Sales released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics is a survey of goods sold by retailers is based on a sampling of retail stores of different types and sizes and it's considered as an indicator of the pace of the Australian economy. It shows the performance of the retail sector over the short and mid-term. Positive economic growth anticipates bullish trends for the AUD, while a low reading is seen as negative or bearish.\nAbout the Australian trade balance\nThe trade balance released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics is the difference in the value of its imports and exports of Australian goods. Export data can give an important reflection of Australian growth, while imports provide an indication of domestic demand. Trade Balance gives an early indication of the net export performance. If a steady demand in exchange for Australian exports is seen, that would turn into a positive growth in the trade balance, and that should be positive for the AUD.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Wall Street's decline added pressure on the AUD at the end of the day.\nThe AUD/USD pair fell to 0.7052, its lowest in three weeks, following RBA's monetary policy announcement. The central bank left the cash rate unchanged at 1.5% as expected, although the wording in the accompanying statement had a dovish tilt that heightened expectations of a rate cut, the main reason behind Aussie weakness. Policymakers acknowledged softer economic growth, removing their forecast of local growth of around 3.0% for this year. \"Further progress in reducing unemployment and having inflation return to target is expected, although this progress is likely to be gradual,\" said Governor Lowe, who said that monetary policy would be set to support sustainable growth. Another dovish turn was seen in the language about the labor market, as despite improvement there remains strong, policymakers now expect wages growth to be a \"gradual process.\"\nSome encouraging headlines related to US-China trade talks failed to boost the pair. A US official said that, at this point, \"a deal is more likely to go forward than not.\" The Australian macroeconomic calendar will be quite busy, as the country will release the AIG Performance of Services Index for March, previously at 44.5, February Retail Sales, seen up by 0.2%, and February trade data, with the monthly surplus forecast at 3,800M. China will release the Caixin Services PMI, foreseen at 52.3 vs. the previous 51.1. This last has more chances of moving AUD/USD than local data.\nThe pair bounced just modestly from the mentioned low, maintaining the sour tone ahead of the Asian opening as it hovers around 0.7060. In the 4 hours chart , the bearish case is firming up, as the price is now below all of its moving averages, while the Momentum indicator maintains a strong bearish slope well below its midline, as the RSI hovers around 28 without directional strength.\nSupport levels: 0.7055 0.7020 0.6980\nResistance levels: 0.7090 0.7130 0.7170\nView Live Chart for the AUD/USD\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
