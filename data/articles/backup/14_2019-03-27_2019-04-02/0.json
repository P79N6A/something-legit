The Feed\nThe NSW Supreme Court is the highest court in the state - it has unlimited jurisdiction with state civil matters and hears the most serious criminal cases.\nOf the 52 judges, eleven are women, with three new female appointments made last year. The Feed\nOf the 41 remaining male judges, three quarters attended Sydney University, raising questions about the Court's commitment to diversity.\nThe director of law research at the University of South Australia Dr Joe McIntrye said he was completely \"horrified\" but \"unsurprised\" by the statistics.\n\"A hundred years ago we dispelled the myth that the law is exhaustive,\" he said.\n\"We recognise personality and background can affect the judicial system.\" The selection process\nSupreme Court judges are appointed by the NSW Government on the recommendation of the NSW Attorney General. The decision is made in close consultation with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and legal professional bodies such as the NSW Bar Association and the NSW Law Society.\nJudges need at least seven years of experience as a lawyer in Australia, but they usually have decades of experience as barristers and solicitors.\nThe Feed requested comment from the NSW Law Society, the NSW Attorney General and the NSW Supreme Court.\nInformation provided by the NSW Supreme Court in response said judicial appointments are based on merit and they have a commitment to promoting diversity.\nDr McIntyre said, unlike the United States and the United Kingdom, Australia is reluctant to recognise that the judges who are selected impact the judicial process.\nIt is a dangerous myth that the judge doesn\u2019t matter.\nThe United Kingdom introduced an independent selection system to appoint judges in an attempt to eliminate any \"tap-on-the shoulder\" method of recruitment - removing the selection responsibility from politicians in most cases.\nThe UK's Judicial Appointment Commission was introduced more than a decade ago and select candidates on merit, good character and to encourage diversity.\nDr McIntyre believes it is inevitable Australia will move toward a similar system but there is a perception a move away from the current process could be undemocratic. A reflection of the 'Merit Myth'\nEducation professor Dr Jill Blackmore said the concentration of privately schooled people in certain professions means the same 'elite' class of people can be replicated over and over again in our society, and our institutions.\n\"This is particularly relevant in medicine and law which are professions that are considered elite,\" Professor Blackmore said.\nThere is a social reproduction model - that tends to be masculine - that favours people from a particular life circumstance.\nProfessor Blackmore said the concentration of white, highly educated men from suburban Australia is not exclusive to the legal industry.\nIn the federal parliament, fewer than twenty of the 226 parliamentarians have a non-English speaking background. The two major parties have never been led by a culturally and linguistically diverse Australian.\nThirty two percent of federal parliamentarians are women.\nThere are more men named John running ASX 200 companies than there are women.\nProfessor Blackmore said that to address issues of diversity unconscious bias and material conditions must be addressed.\n\"But I've been writing on this topic for more than thirty years and not much has changed,\" she said.

DARRYL DYCK / THE CANADIAN PRESS\nVICTORIA \u2014 A preliminary decision by the BC Ferries commission would cap annual ferry fare hikes at just over two per cent for five years starting in 2020.\nThe Office of the BC Ferries Commissioner says in a news release that a maximum yearly fare increase of 2.3 per cent is based on total operating expenses increasing at, or just above, the rate of inflation.\nAt the same time, Commissioner Sheldon Stoilen expects the trend of increased ferry traffic will level off by next year.\nThe proposed price cap covers BC Ferries\u2019 fifth performance term, which begins April 1, 2020 and ends March 31, 2024.\nThe commissioner has until September to finalize the decision and public comments are being accepted until the end of June.\nBC Ferries was permitted to implement annual fare hikes of up to 1.9 per cent during the last five-year performance term, but Stoilen says average increases were lower than the maximum allowed.\nHe\u2019s pleased the proposed price caps are close to the consumer price index in B.C., but warns holding the line on fare increases could become increasingly difficult.\n\u201cThe major challenges to operating a world-class system that is affordable to the riding public and taxpayers can be expected to persist and even deepen,\u201d Stoilen says in the release.\nFuel costs are the second-highest cost for the service and are estimated at $108.7 million for fiscal 2019 but Stoilen says they have been effectively managed and could decline due to a higher use of liquefied natural gas fuel.\nHowever long-term capital plans will have a moderate impact on the upcoming performance term and \u201ccould have a larger impact for following terms,\u201d the release says.\nStoilen also points to non-controllable costs in the upcoming performance term such as $19.8 million for the provincial carbon tax, $6.1 million for the new provincial health tax and $19.4 for Canada Pension Plan rates.\nHe urges BC Ferries to develop a plan for the conversion to all-electric ferries as soon as infrastructure and technology is available.\nOther recommendations include possible reductions in the long-term capital plan to ease pressure on future price caps at the publicly owned, independently managed company.\nA tracking process and reporting requirement to meet targets for reducing operating, maintenance costs and administration costs should also be developed, Stoilen says.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://vancouversun.com/tag/bc-ferries", "https://vancouversun.com/subscription"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sheldon stoilen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darryl dyck", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "office of the bc ferries commissioner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bc ferries", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vancouver island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mayne island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tsawwassen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swartz bay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "galiano island", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T00:13:24.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "670009cee67c28f38bc3a150fb9e31955a60782a", "url": "http://www.nasdaq.com/article/tech-financials-lead-stock-market-rally-cm1123042", "site_full": "www.nasdaq.com", "site": "nasdaq.com", "site_section": "https://www.nasdaq.com/", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Daily Stock Market Overview, Data Updates, Reports &amp; News - Nasdaq", "title": "Tech, Financials Lead Stock Market Rally", "title_full": "Tech, Financials Lead Stock Market Rally - Nasdaq.com", "published": "2019-04-01T12:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/images/dreamit.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2975, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "670009cee67c28f38bc3a150fb9e31955a60782a", "url": "http://www.nasdaq.com/article/tech-financials-lead-stock-market-rally-cm1123042", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Schaeffer's Research", "published": "2019-04-01T12:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "Tech, Financials Lead Stock Market Rally", "text": "Shutterstock photo Stocks had a strong showing today, rallying out of the gate for a convincing start to the second quarter.

The Canadian Press 12:18AM EDT Last Updated Monday, April 1, 2019 7:26PM EDT\nTORONTO -- North American stock markets opened the second quarter higher Monday on unexpected manufacturing growth in China and positive data in the U.S.\nEverybody was writing off China and stoking fears of a possible recession, but positive manufacturing data signals that forecasts of doom and gloom may have been misplaced, says Allan Small, senior investment adviser at HollisWealth.\n\"Well China data was good, so that rally looks like some of the initiatives that government is taking over there, some of the stimulus is kicking in,\" he said in an interview.\nThe monthly purchasing managers' index rose above 50 for the first time in several months, pointing to increased activity. An economic report out of China also showed growth in exports, employment and orders.\nPositive news also came out of the United States, with manufacturers growing at a faster pace in March and construction spending increasing in February. However, retail sales fell in February.\n\"We're waiting for some more data this week and perhaps it's not as bad as people think, and if we can ever get a deal between the U.S. and China, I think this market goes higher,\" Small added.\nChinese and U.S. negotiations are set to resume in Washington this week after U.S. officials pointed to positive movement last week in Beijing.\nThe S&P/TSX composite index closed up 125.97 points to 16,228.06 Monday in the first day of trading in April and the second quarter.\nSmall said it's premature to say the second three months of 2019 will mirror the first three, which saw the Toronto market gain 12.4 per cent.\n\"You're looking historically at a pretty good month,\" he said of April.\n\"You never know what happens tomorrow but I'll take it today and enjoy it.\"\nSeven of the market's 11 major sectors rose, led by consumer discretionary, along with the powerhouse energy, financials and industrials sectors.\nEnergy gained as the price of crude hit a near five-month high on hopeful signs of higher demand from China. Cenovus Energy Inc. rose 4.7 per cent on the day.\nThe May crude contract was up US$1.45 at US$61.59 per barrel and the May natural gas contract was up 4.6 cents at $2.71 per mmBTU.\nFinancials was up on a stabilizing yield curve after it inverted last week. Laurentian Bank, Toronto-Dominion and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce were up nearly two per cent.\nMaterials led on the downside as metals prices fell.\nThe June gold contract was down US$4.30 at US$1,294.20 an ounce and the May copper contract was down 1.1 cents at US$2.92 a pound.\nThe Canadian dollar traded at an average of 74.98 cents US, up from an average of 74.83 cents US on Friday.\nIn New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 329.74 points at 26,258.42. The S&P 500 index was up 32.79 points at 2,867.19, while the Nasdaq composite was up 99.59 points at 7,828.91.\nDespite warnings about softer economic growth, Small sees markets improving with the right catalyst.\n\"I think the catalyst is going to have to come from something and I keep coming back to politics and trade.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "s&p/tsx", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T00:23:37.036+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0636d98c93e05ec297a58b25e6c09db3431b5ff3", "url": "https://www.kitco.com/news/2019-04-01/Mixed-data-offer-glimmers-of-hope-for-slowing-U-S-economy.html", "site_full": "www.kitco.com", "site": "kitco.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Mixed data offer glimmers of hope for slowing U.S. economy | Kitco News", "title_full": "Mixed data offer glimmers of hope for slowing U.S. economy | Kitco News", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.kitco.com/images/kitco-news-social-share-logo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7841, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0636d98c93e05ec297a58b25e6c09db3431b5ff3", "url": "https://www.kitco.com/news/2019-04-01/Mixed-data-offer-glimmers-of-hope-for-slowing-U-S-economy.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Http", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Mixed data offer glimmers of hope for slowing U.S. economy | Kitco News", "text": "Mixed data offer glimmers of hope for slowing U.S. economy Reuters Monday April 01, 2019 15:01\nKitco News\nShare this article:\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell in February, but a rebound in factory activity in March and strong increase in construction spending offered hope the economy was not slowing as sharply as previously feared.\nThe mixed reports on Monday prompted economists to raise their growth projections for the first quarter. Still, the economy\u2019s improving prospects were not expected to have any impact on the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision last month to abruptly end its three-year campaign to tighten monetary policy.\nThe U.S. central bank abandoned projections for any interest rate hikes this year after increasing borrowing costs four times in 2018, acknowledging rising headwinds, including a fading stimulus from $1.5 trillion in tax cuts, trade wars, slowing global growth and uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union.\n\u201cThe economic downslide may be over but there are no clear indications that an acceleration in growth is at hand,\u201d said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. \u201cThe Fed has reason to watch and wait.\u201d\nRetail sales dropped 0.2 percent as households cut back on purchases of furniture, clothing, food and electronics and appliances, as well as building materials and gardening equipment. But January\u2019s sales increase was revised up to 0.7 percent from the previously reported 0.2 percent.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales rising 0.3 percent in February. Retail sales in February advanced 2.2 percent from a year ago.\nThe surprise drop in sales in February could partly reflect delays in processing tax refunds in the middle of the month. Tax refunds have also been smaller on average compared to prior years following the revamping of the tax code in January 2018. Cold and snowy weather could also have hurt sales.\nExcluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales fell 0.2 percent in February after an upwardly revised 1.7 percent surge in January. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.\nThey were previously reported to have rebounded 1.1 percent in January. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity. While the upward revision to core retail sales did not reverse December\u2019s 2.2 percent plunge, it put consumer spending for the first-quarter on a slightly higher growth trajectory than before.\nThere was a further boost to first-quarter GDP prospects, with a second report from the Commerce Department showing construction spending rose 1.0 percent to a nine-month high in February after surging 2.5 percent in January.\nA third report from the department showed business inventories increased 0.8 percent in January, matching December\u2019s gain. Though the strong inventory build suggests demand is slowing it lifted GDP forecasts for the first quarter. MANUFACTURING STABILIZING\n\u201cConsumption, however, is likely to remain weak, and the inventory build is getting ominous,\u201d said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York.\nGoldman Sachs raised its first-quarter GDP estimate by four-tenths of a percentage point to a 1.2 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent rate in the October-December quarter. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.\nWhile demand is softening, the supply side of the economy is stabilizing. In a fourth report on Monday, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to a reading of 55.3 in March from 54.2 in February, which had marked the lowest level since November 2016.\nThe reading was slightly above expectations of 54.5 from a Reuters poll of 69 economists. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.\nThe ISM said 16 industries, including machinery, computer and electronic products, furniture, and electrical equipment, appliances and components, reported growth last month. Apparel and paper products industries reported a contraction.\nManufactures in the computer and electronic products industry said the sector \u201cseems to be slowly coming out of crisis mode.\u201d Chemical producers said \u201cBrexit continues to be a concern, despite the fact that our organization has already rolled out a plan to minimize its impact.\u201d\nThe ISM\u2019s new orders sub-index increased to a reading of 57.4 last month from 55.5 in February. But a measure of export orders fell, likely reflecting softening global economic growth.\nFactories reported hiring more workers last month, with a measure of manufacturing employment racing to a reading of 57.5 from 52.3 in February. That bodes well for a rebound in job growth in March after hiring almost stalled in February. March\u2019s employment report is scheduled for release on Friday.\n\u201cOverall we think that things are stabilizing following the earlier deterioration rather than intensifying,\u201d said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.\nReporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and may not reflect those of Kitco Metals Inc.

Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, told FOX Business that since many industries \u2013 particularly the auto industry \u2013 are highly integrated between both countries, the impact on companies could be substantial.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cParts are produced in one country, and then transported to the other country for final assembly,\u201d Lester noted. \u201cShutting down the border will essentially shut down the production process for these companies, making it impossible for them to produce.\u201d\nDan Griswold of the Mercatus Center said in a statement that an average of 15,000 trucks and $1.6 billion worth of goods cross the southern border each day, meaning U.S. producers could \u201csuffer crippling disruptions of their supply chains,\u201d leading to a spike in consumer prices.\nIn 2018, the U.S. imported $346.5 billion worth of goods from Mexico, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau . Exports were valued at $265 billion during the same time period.\nCouncil of Economic Advisers chair Kevin Hassett told reporters on Monday that a border shutdown could impact the U.S. economy, though he said he would have to get back to them with specifics and modeling projections.\nThe number of border apprehensions in March exceeded 100,000 in March, while more than 76,000 individuals illegally crossed the border in February.

The result being market speculations that the House of Commons will deliver a solution to Brexit deadlock after British lawmakers continue to reject PM May\u2019s proposal while fail to support any of the parliament\u2019s options in the first go.\nHowever, UK MPs pour cold water on those expectations as results came out before few minutes show none of the four Brexit proposals were welcomed by the parliament voters.

Rising stock graphs on colorful background. More Image source: Getty Images. Apple axes AirPower, cuts prices in China Apple investors got a mixed bag of news today, with the company canceling the AirPower charging mat and reducing prices in China. Shares crept up 0.7%. The cancellation of AirPower amounts to an embarrassment for Apple, but probably won't have much of an impact on financial results. The company announced AirPower in September 2017 as part of the iPhone X unveiling and said it would be available in 2018. Apparently the product development hit some technical snags, so iPhone users will continue to rely on third-party devices for wireless charging. More important to the company's future results was a price cut to iPhone products in China, as reported by CNBC . The price of the entry-level iPhone X model, the XR, was lowered 4.6%, and the price tags on the XS and XS Max were cut 5.7% and 5.2%, respectively. A shortfall in China sales took Apple by surprise and caused a rare downward revision in guidance in January. This week's price action may help revive the iPhone business there, and a cut in China's value-added tax from 16% to 13%, which went into effect today, should ease the profit impact on Apple. Kellogg cuts back on sweets Kellogg is getting out of the cookie business, announcing today that it is selling those brands, along with fruit-flavored snacks, pie crust, and ice cream cone product lines to Italian confection company Ferrero Group for $1.3 billion. Kellogg shares fell 2.4%. The divestiture includes cookie brands such as Keebler, Mother's, Famous Amos, and cookies the company makes for Girl Scouts. Ferrero Group makes chocolates, Nutella, and Tic Tac breath mints. Kellogg had already announced it was looking for a buyer for those businesses as it tries to reshape its portfolio by investing in new brands in areas such as digestive health and natural foods and reviving existing brands. The affected products accounted for net sales of almost $900 million in 2018 out of total sales of $13.5 billion. The U.S. snack segment of the company suffered a sales decline of nearly 5% last year, and Kellogg thinks divesting parts of that business will help it deliver organic growth of 1% to 2% in 2019, up from a flat performance last year.

Many are referring to this as \u201cthe retail apocalypse\u201d , and without a doubt this is one of the toughest stretches for retailers that we have ever seen. But many believe that what we have witnessed so far is just the beginning . After all, if retailers are struggling this much now, how bad will things be once the next recession really gets rolling?\nOf course the truth is that things have been rocky for the retail industry for quite a few years, but the numbers are telling us that this crisis is really starting to accelerate.\n***Support BeforeItsNews by trying APeX (far superior to colloidal silver) or any of our other great health products at www.mitocopper.com *** According to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, retail layoffs were up a whopping 92 percent in January and February compared to the same period a year ago. The following comes from NBC News \u2026\nMore than 41,000 people have lost their jobs in the retail industry so far this year \u2014 a 92 percent spike in layoffs since the same time last year, according to a new report.\nAnd the layoffs continue to mount, with JCPenney announcing this week it would be closing 18 stores in addition to three previously announced closures, as part of a \u201cstandard annual review.\u201d\nYes, competition from Internet commerce is hurting the traditional retail industry, but it certainly doesn\u2019t explain a 92 percent increase.\nAnd very few retailers have been able to avoid this downsizing trend. At this point, even the largest retailer in the entire country has begun \u201cquietly closing stores\u201d \u2026\nWalmart is closing at least 11 US stores across eight states.\nThe stores include one Walmart Supercenter in Lafayette, Louisiana, and Walmart Neighborhood Market stores in Arizona, California, Kansas, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Washington.\nFor decades, Wal-Mart has been expanding extremely aggressively.\nThey have plenty of cash, and so the only way that it would make sense for them to close stores is if they anticipated that we are heading into a recession.\nHere is a list of the addresses where Wal-Mart stores are closing \u2026\n6085 W. Chandler Blvd., Chandler, Arizona\n3900 W. Ina Road, Tucson, Arizona\n1600 Saratoga Ave., San Jose, California\n712 N. Western Ave., Liberal, Kansas\n1229 NE. Evangeline Trwy., Lafayette, Louisiana\n3603 Broad River Road, Columbia, South Carolina\n1757 W. Andrew Johnson Hwy., Morristown, Tennessee\n2501 University Commons Way, Knoxville, Tennessee\n7000 Iron Bridge Road, North Chesterfield, Virginia\n2864 Virginia Beach Blvd., Virginia Beach, Virginia\n7809 NE. Vancouver Plaza Dr., Vancouver, Washington\nOf course Wal-Mart is in far better shape than almost everyone else in the industry.\nOne of Wal-Mart\u2019s key competitors, Shopko, has just announced that they will be shutting down all of their stores \u2026\nShopko will liquidate its assets and close all of its remaining locations by mid-June.\nThe company was unable to find a buyer for the retail business and will begin winding down its operations beginning this week, the company said in statement released Monday. The decision to liquidate will bring an end to the brick-and-mortar business that began in 1962 with one location in Green Bay, Wisconsin.\nAnd personally I was very saddened to learn that Lifeway Christian Bookstores has also decided to close all their brick and mortar stores \u2026\nLifeway Christian Bookstores announced last week it would be closing the doors of all 170 brick and mortar stores, in a pivot to focusing on digital and e-commerce.\n\u201cThe decision to close our local stores is a difficult one,\u201d said Lifeway Chief Executive Officer Brad Waggoner. \u201cWhile we had hoped to keep some stores open, current market projections show this is no longer a viable option.\u201d\nWhenever I do an article like this, I always have some readers that try to convince me that this is only happening because of the growth of Internet retailing.\nAnd yes, Internet retailing has been growing, but it still accounts for less than 10 percent of all U.S. retail sales. In addition, it is important to point out that Internet retailers had a very disappointing holiday season just like brick and mortar retailers did.\nUltimately, the truth is that the U.S. economy has been steadily slowing down in recent months.\nDuring the months of December, January and February, the amount of stuff being moved around the country by truck, rail and air was lower than during all of those same months a year earlier. The following comes from Wolf Richter \u2026\nNow it\u2019s the third month in a row, and the red flag is getting more visible and a little harder to ignore about the goods-based economy: Freight shipment volume in the US across all modes of transportation \u2013 truck, rail, air, and barge \u2013 in February fell 2.1% from February a year ago, according to the Cass Freight Index , released today. The three months in a row of year-over-year declines are the first such declines since the transportation recession of 2015 and 2016.\nI have a feeling that when we get the final numbers for March that they will show that this streak has now extended to four months.\nRight now, unsold goods are starting to pile up in U.S. warehouses at a rate that we haven\u2019t seen since the last recession. Many retailers that are barely clinging to life will simply not survive if economic conditions continue to deteriorate.\nUnfortunately, it appears that things are only going to get rougher for the U.S. economy in the months ahead.\nSo more retail workers are going to get laid off, more stores are going to close, and there are going to be a lot more stories about our ongoing \u201cretail apocalypse\u201d in the mainstream media.\nAbout the author: Michael Snyder is a nationally-syndicated writer, media personality and political activist.

Down Like Death of Dinosaurs | Economy", "text": "By: David Haggith / GoldSeek\nFor brick and mortar stores, the Retail Apocalypse is closing stores down like a slow-motion video of the asteroid event that took out dinosaurs 66 million years ago. While it may seem to drag on as we watch various species of retail collapse, I originally said this event would take, at least, three years (through the end of 2019) for the bulk of the impact to play out.\nIt was two years ago that I started writing about the damage that was to come and all the collateral damage that would ensue. I said that ultimately, it would take out malls all over the nation, nearby restaurants and eventually gas stations.\n***Support BeforeItsNews by trying APeX (far superior to colloidal silver) or any of our other great health products at www.mitocopper.com *** In February of this year, I wrote about the closure of shopping malls sweeping the nation as the damage is beginning to pile up, but we still have most of 2019 to go just for the main event to play out and then a long tail of collateral damage and dwindling store closures after that as death of one species ends the food chain of another and the circles of damage widen outward from the giants of retail that were the first to go because the least adaptable.\nLatest events of the Retail Apocalypse This is just a mini update on how 2019 is going for the dinosaurs of commerce. The first quarter of the year is just coming to a close, and retail has already lost 41,000 jobs for the year, and that doesn\u2019t even include March. That is 92% more than the number of retail jobs lost during the same period of 2018, which was worse than 2017. So, the rate of closures is still climaxing.\nJC Penny announced this week another 18 store closures on top of the numerous closures it already announced over the last couple of years. So, their drawn-out closure process, too, keeps building beyond what Penny originally anticipated.\nMark Hamrick, the Bureau Chief and senior economic analyst for Bankrate, now offers the following assessment:\nMark Hamrick \u201cThis is significant, and marks an acceleration of store closures and job cuts in the near term. Retail is ground zero for seeing the shifts of change in our lives.\u201d https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/retail-apocalypse-jcpenney-payless-lifeway-announce-3-000-combined-store-n988756 \u2026 @MCappetta @NBCNews @Bankrate 7:46 PM \u2013 Mar 29, 2019 Lifeway Christian Bookstores just announced it is closing the remainder of its stores, having begun closures several years ago. They had hoped to keep some stores open but no longer see that as an option. They will continue with an online presence. Payless Shoes announced in February it is closing all of its 2,100 US stores. Those store closures were scheduled to begin now (at the end of March) and will be mostly wrapped up by the end of May. Payless will not continue with any online presence.\nThough the continued reverberations of this retail saga are due mostly to the growth of online business, overall retail (including online) did not do well in the final quarter of 2018. We\u2019ll soon see where the first quarter of 2019 ends up.\n 2018 Retail Sales Growth/Decline (Each gradation = 0.5%. November was zero. Dec. -1.6 %)\nRetail Apocalypse closing stores at a faster rate Total announced store closures for the first three months of this year is a little over 4,200. That is a 23% increase over the same time last year, and last year was bad enough to result in the numerous major shopping mall closures I laid out in my last article on this subject. The 4,200 closures is partially offset by 1,411 announced store openings; but that still leaves the old dinosaurs of retail dying off at about a 3:1 pace over new store openings \u2014 the mammals that are emerging in their place. It\u2019s an extinction-level event in the world of retail.\nIf you think the shift in paradigms is not going to be painful, then read that last link about how such a time went for the dinosaurs. Yes, life forms that can adapt enough eventually fill in and may even make for a better world when the cataclysm is over. (I know I\u2019d be glad for a world with less traffic and fewer parking lots as we move to online retail.)\nHowever, the passing away of the old is epic; and we are not at the point where new, smaller life forms have repopulated the earth. We are at the point in the Retail Apocalypse where the reptilian beasts of old are laying their colossal frames down to die in the settling dust and debris of the asteroid impact. The end result can be a better world in a new era, but the transition period will reek of global death and decay. The smell is just now starting to offend.\nWise and adaptive are all individuals who ready themselves for the transition. They will be the new mammals that walk the earth in years to come.\nLiked it?

Gold prices approach wave relationships\nIn last week\u2019s webinar, we highlighted how the gold price chart is showing many symptoms of a near term bearish reversal . Since last week, gold prices have fallen nearly 2.5% holding to the bearish forecast.\nIt is anticipated that gold would hold below Monday\u2019s high of $1325 with some targets and wave relationships appearing below $1250. What this means is that if gold prices continue to fall below $1250, we will look for signs of a longer-term bottom forming.\nThough not expected, if gold prices do run higher above $1325 before dropping below $1250, then we will need to reassess the forecast and reconsider if the multi-year Elliott wave triangle has finished and found a low.\nTherefore, we are showing the current Elliott wave for gold to be wave \u2018c\u2019 ( zigzag ) of wave E of a triangle. We are counting the triangle as a larger wave (X) which began in July 2016.\nRead more\u2026\nTop gold trading strategies and tips Silver prices in a similar Elliott wave pattern as gold prices\nSilver price forecast is similar to gold in that we are looking for continued weakness to be temporary. We believe silver is in the \u2018c\u2019 wave of a zigzag pattern . Once this \u2018c\u2019 wave exhausts, we will anticipate a large rally to $17 and possibly $19 that may take many months to complete.\nUsing Elliott wave relationships, we forecast this current \u2018c\u2019 wave to fall towards 14.40-14.80. From there, we are anticipating a rally to above 16.20 and possibly to 17.00 while holding above 13.89.\nRead more\u2026\nTrading the gold-silver ratio: strategies and tips NZD/USD Breaks Temporary Key Level\nIn last week\u2019s webinar we followed up to our analyst pick from two week\u2019s ago how the Elliott wave triangle pattern may have finalized . We outlined a forecast that stated \u201cif NZDUSD were to unexpectedly fall below .6814, then some other wave pattern is at play.\u201d\nWell, NZDUSD did fall below .6814. Therefore, it appears the Kiwi may still be consolidating inside the triangle with another complex wave. The bullish forecast is essentially delayed on a temporary basis with prices holding above .6720. Below .6720 and more options are added back for consideration. USDJPY falls but longer term bullish pattern remains\nThe multi-year bullish forecast yielded on January 3 remains in place despite the recent correction for USDJPY. Last week\u2019s dip to 109.70 did meet some wave relationships. It is possible that after a brief rally to near 112, USDJPY may turn lower to retest 109.70 as the depth of the March 5 correction is a little short.\nWe are uncertain of the odds of a retest, but do believe that after the correction is over, a large rally may ensue as USDJPY wave be in a third wave of an impulsive wave sequence. Third waves tend to be the longest and strongest of the Elliott wave sequence. If correct, then wave 3 would break to new highs above 112 that may work up towards 117-122. Elliott Wave Theory FAQ\nHow does Elliott Wave theory work?\nElliott Wave theory is a trading study that identifies the highs and lows of price movements on charts via wave patterns. Traders analyze the waves for 5-wave moves and 3-wave corrections to determine where the market is at within the larger pattern. Additionally, the theory maintains three rules and several guidelines on the depth of the waves related to one another. Therefore, it is common to use Fibonacci with Elliott Wave analysis. We cover these topics in our beginners and advanced Elliott Wave trading guides.\nAfter reviewing the guides above , be sure to follow future Elliott Wave articles to see Elliott Wave Theory in action.\nNot sure if Elliott wave is right for you? Believe it or not, when I first started trading I couldn\u2019t understand why technical analysis worked. Now, I\u2019m 100% technical through Elliott wave.

Startups are leading the way of change in technology-driven and traditional markets. As an investor, you are familiar with the recent uproar in the venture capital market. From new technology to the largest deals ever made, this past year was one for the books. To ensure that you can keep up with the ever-growing market and continue to profit, you need to stay up-to-date with the current movements. Read on to learn about the latest venture capital trends to watch this year.\nLeaning Away From Unicorns One of the most shocking ventures capital trends to watch this year is a drift away from investing in unicorns. If a business is considered a \u201cunicorn\u201d , it is worth at least $1 billion. In the past, investors thrived to put their money into such companies with the hope of receiving the most money back in return. However, investors today are drifting toward promising businesses that improve already-invented products. Many venture capital firms fail to beat their competitors to unicorn companies. Thus, they receive no returns because they spent too much time chasing the possibility of 10x returns. Many unicorn companies end up falling financially, leaving their investors with little return as well. For these reasons, investors are predicted to fund unicorns less this year.\nDirect Listing in the Stock Exchange Another latest venture capital trend to watch this year is direct listings. After a well-known company went against the current IPO standards and filed with a direct listing, other popular businesses are considering doing the same. Such businesses let the market decide on fair stock prices, unlike the Snapchat IP euphoria . The venture capitalist market received surprising results through this new process. Venture capitalists who invested in the business that direct listed made large profits. Their share prices grew much more than expected. Furthermore, there was not any dilution from institutional investors or banks. This coming year, more businesses are predicted to file with direct listings. Consider investing in them to keep up with positive venture capital trends.\nLarge Corporations Get Creative With Funding If you are interested in corporate venture capital funding trends, you will be pleased to read that large corporation involvement is growing in the market. Many successful corporations use business funding programs. These programs require support from smaller businesses. If done well, you can turn a traditional funding opportunity into an advantageous business partnership. Because more and more of these partnerships are benefiting both parties, more large corporations want to get involved with venture capital ventures. Consider funding growing corporations this year.\nRobotics and Drones Leading the Way Robotics and drones are also increasingly affecting the venture capital market. Right now, such technology companies are receiving investments on a monthly basis. These robotics and drones businesses do more than create physical devices. They also build automation software that generates a lot of cash flow for both business owners and investors. To make the most of an investment in this area, former Angellist partner Lee Jacobs recommends, \u201c Since these areas are so new, venture capitalists should evaluate each startup pitch as a unique opportunity and build the business case from the bottoms up.\u201d Since this industry is still in its early stages, there are certainly many different types of startups and business models coming up. Combined with increasing consumer demand for these products, you should consider investing in robotics and drones companies this year.\nMore Startup Exits Finally, one of the latest venture capital trends to pay attention to is an increase in startup exiting. In previous years, this was not thought because startup exiting was continuously declining. Because of changes in federal regulation and taxation , experts predict that the previous trend will reverse to increasing startup exiting. If you have found yourself stuck in life-cycles that lasted longer than you planned, you could benefit from this new trend. With the right startup exit, you gain more new investment opportunities with other startups. Keep your eye out for this venture capital trend this year.\nSince the venture capital market is always changing, you need to stay up-to-date on the latest trends in order to profit. Pay attention to the prospective decrease in unicorn investments. The direct listing could be increasing this year after a well-known company\u2019s positive outcome. Larger corporations are getting more involved in venture capital funding. The desire for robotic and drone technology is increasing, making tech companies great investment prospects. Lastly, startup exit rates are rising and creating more opportunities for investors.

One of Connecticut\u2019s better known white elephants \u2014 rapper 50 Cent\u2019s massive Farmington mansion \u2014has finally traded for $2.9 million, or 84% less than what it first sought 12 years ago, according to people familiar with the deal.\nThe musician, whose birth name is Curtis James Jackson III, purchased the property from former boxer Mike Tyson for $4.1 million in 2003, property records show. That deal set a still-standing record for the most expensive home ever sold in Farmington, which is about 80 miles north of Greenwich, according to appraiser Jonathan Miller. The property first listed in 2007, then underwent several price cuts over the years and was listed by various different agencies. Most recently it was seeking for $4.995 million, according to Zillow. It had also been listed for rent at $100,000 a month.\nApproximately 50,000-square-foot, the 52-room compound is much larger with other homes in the town of Farmington. The original listing pictures show a basketball court with the logo for Jackson\u2019s G-Unit hip hop group, and a night club decorated with murals depicting Jackson\u2019s large back tattoo and of him wearing a bedazzled cross medallion and pointing a gun. The house also has game rooms, a recording studio, a home theater, an indoor pool and a conference center.\nThe estate was costing the rapper almost $70,000 a month to carry, including property taxes and mortgage payments, according to documents related to his Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in 2015. He managed to hold onto the house despite his financial difficulties several years ago.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\nAramco emerges ahead of Apple as world\u2019s most profitable company.\nNew York\u2019s congestion-pricing system will serve as road test for other cities.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-yorks-congestion-pricing-system-will-serve-as-road-test-for-other-cities-11554122682?mod=mktw", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/50-cent-sells-massive-connecticut-compound-for-84-less-11554152164?mod=mktw", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/aramco-is-the-most-profitable-company-on-earth-ratings-agencies-say-11554102173?mod=mktw", "https://b2c-banner.marketing.moveaws.com/welcome/banner/localsearch/localsearch.php"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "50 cent", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jonathan miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "curtis james jackson iii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike tyson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "marketwatch getty images", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "zillow", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "farmington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenwich", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T01:21:43.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4a3f9bd3c8bdefda10a2fcb251b6af24fd8aa9d2", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/5371991/50-cent-donates-profits-from-his-connecticut-mansion-to-charity/", "site_full": "www.inquisitr.com", "site": "inquisitr.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.inquisitr.com/TheInquisitrEntertainment", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Entertainment | The Inquisitr", "title": "50 Cent Donates Profits From His Connecticut Mansion To Charity", "title_full": "50 Cent Donates Profits From His Connecticut Mansion To Charity", "published": "2019-04-02T01:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/50-cent.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2130, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4a3f9bd3c8bdefda10a2fcb251b6af24fd8aa9d2", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/5371991/50-cent-donates-profits-from-his-connecticut-mansion-to-charity/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kristina Smolenski Nelson", "published": "2019-04-02T01:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "50 Cent Donates Profits From His Connecticut Mansion To Charity", "text": "April 1, 2019 50 Cent Donates Profits From His Connecticut Mansion To Charity 50 cent recently donated the $3 million he earned from his mansion sale to his charity. Amanda Edwards / Getty Images Kristina Smolenski Nelson 50 cent recently donated the $3 million he earned from his mansion sale to his charity.\nWhenever a well-known celebrity makes a massive donation to charity, some kudos to that famous person\u2019s kindness are in order. According to TMZ , 50 Cent just sold his huge mansion in Connecticut, and then sent the proceeds over to make a huge charitable donation.\n50 Cent\u2019s recently unloaded mansion, which totaled around 50,000 square feet, included 21 bedrooms with 25 bathrooms. The mansion is located in Farmington, Connecticut. The house featured a night club and several game rooms. The rapper had listed the house on the market for several years, and it his original starting price was $18.5 million in 2007.\n50 Cent took a huge loss selling the home, as the buyer got the mansion at a $3 million steal. However, 50 Cent reportedly still feels great about the sale, because sources close to him claim he will be giving all of the $3 million he just pocketed from the sale of the mansion to the rapper\u2019s G-Unity Foundation. 50 Cent\u2019s G-Unity Foundation helps non-profit companies that are trying to better the quality of life for those living in low-income communities receive grants, according to TMZ .\n50 Cent purchased the huge Farmington mansion back in 2003 from the previous owner, Mike Tyson for a total of $4.1 million, property records demonstrate according to Mansion Global . When 50 Cent bought the house, he wound up setting the record in Farmington for the most expensive sale of a home the city ever experienced. In fact, 50 Cent\u2019s original purchase of the Farmington mansion still holds that record today.\n50 Cent reportedly paid a significant amount each month totaling nearly $70,000 to keep the mansion. That figure covered both 50 Cent\u2019s mortgage and property taxes. Since the rapper recently had to file bankruptcy under Chapter 11 in 2015 after he started struggling financially, he still kept the mansion.\nNow passed his financial issues, the rapper seems pleased he sold the house. In fact, for a few years, he joked around publicly about owning the property. For example, somebody tried to break into the property back in 2017, but the burglary attempt failed. After learning about the attempted break-in, the rapper joked that he had not realized his house was going to be robbed because he thought he sold it, according to Mansion Global. 50 Cent Sells Connecticut Mansion For $3 Million, Donating Money to Charity https://t.co/bsO5u4t2hk\n\u2014 TMZ (@TMZ) April 1, 2019\n50 Cent was still showing his funny side as late as January 2019 when he talked about his Connecticut mansion with Stephen Colbert on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The rapper joked about the size of the mansion while he was interviewed by Colbert.\n\u201cYou know when you look down the hallway in your house and you don\u2019t wanna go down there?,\u201d 50 Cent said, according to Mansion Global. . \u201cThings would break because you didn\u2019t use it.

Traders may now focus on the US durable goods order and New Zealand GDT price index for fresh impulse.\nDuring early Tuesday, New Zealand\u2019s quarterly NZIER business confidence, also known as NZIER QSBO, dropped to -29 from -17 during the first quarter (Q1) of the present year.\nEven if optimism surrounding the US-China trade deal and recent improvements in China\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 indices (PMIs) placate bears, soft domestic data and stronger US Dollar (USD) continued to portray the NZD/USD pair\u2019s weakness.\nThe quote failed to clear 50-day simple moving average (SMA) on Monday as the USD rose against the majority of its counterparts on upbeat ISM manufacturing PMI and also because of the optimism surrounding its likely trade deal with China.\nTraders may now concentrate on February month durable goods orders from the US ahead of shifting their attention to the fortnightly release of New Zealand\u2019s GDT price index.\nThe US durable goods orders growth may disappoint greenback bulls if matching -1.8% market consensus versus +0.3% revised prior. The non-defense capital goods orders ex-aircraft could flash 0.0% mark against +0.8% earlier. On the other hand, the GDT price index may also register the slow growth of +0.3% versus +1.9% previous.\nNZD/USD Technical Analysis\nIn addition to an upward sloping support-line stretched since January 22 at 0.6770, 200-day SMA figure of 0.6785 could also challenge Kiwi bears.\nMeanwhile, a daily closing beyond 50-day SMA level of 0.6830 becomes pre-requisite for buyers to aim for 0.6880 and 0.6910.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

The cross-border commerce also supports more than 4.5 million American jobs, according to a study prepared for the Business Roundtable.\nEven a partial shutdown of the border by President Donald Trump -- some bridges closed, far fewer agents performing inspections, leading to more hours-long waits to cross -- can have a biting effect on the economy and everyday life along the border.\nEverything from the availability of avocados to auto sales could be affected as vegetables and car parts would be among the things slowed or stopped on the journey north.\nNo place is exposed to a potential shutdown quite like Texas. Mexico is by far Texas\u2019 largest trading partner.\n\u201cIf this would be bad for the U.S. economy, then it would be devastating to the Texas economy,\u201d said Christopher Wilson, deputy executive director of the Wilson Center\u2019s Mexico Institute in Washington.

(Ryan Michalesko/Staff Photographer)\nMexico accounted for some $187 billion in trade with Texas last year. That activity supports hundreds of thousands of Texas jobs covering everything from agriculture to automobile manufacturing to energy production.\nAlready frustrated by Trump\u2019s tariffs, which have prompted retaliatory levies from Mexico and other countries, the business community in Texas and beyond is now bracing for things to get worse.\nTrump has said he\u2019d close the border as soon as this week in response to what he sees as a failure by Mexican authorities to stop waves of Central American migrants from crossing into the U.S. Apprehensions at the border have reached a 12-year high, and many of the detained are families and children.\nThe migrants have the legal right to request asylum once in the U.S.. But they\u2019re overwhelming shelters and, the government says, putting a strain on the Border Patrol. Border patrol closes ramshackle migrant holding pen near where top Trump official declared crisis\nClosing the U.S-Mexico border would not necessarily stop the migrants from crossing between border checkpoints, but experts said it would have an immediate impact at the border itself.\nIt\u2019s not just the massive network of warehousing, trucking and other logistical enterprises that has developed there to handle the massive flows of trade. There\u2019s also the simple fact that people along the border cross it every day to work, shop and dine.\nTake El Paso and southern New Mexico, where it\u2019s estimated that 15 to 30 percent of the retail trade is done by Mexican nationals, said Jon Barela, CEO of the Borderplex Alliance.\n\u201cSmall businesses will be the first to be hit very hard\u201d said Barela, whose organization is a binational economic development group based in El Paso. \u201cIt would wreak havoc.\u201d\nDamage would extend from there, experts said.\nIt wouldn\u2019t take long, for instance, for a Dallas grocery shopper to notice. Ten million metric tons of produce enters the U.S. from Mexico each year, accounting for more than 40 percent of all fruits and veggies imported into the country, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.\nAvocado-loving Americans would run out of the essential ingredient for guacamole in three weeks if Mexican imports were stopped, Steve Barnard, president of Mission Produce, the largest distributor and grower of avocados in the world, told Reuters.\nThey might also be forced to scramble for foods like strawberries and peppers, said Jennifer Apperti, manager of the Mission Foods Texas-Mexico Center at Southern Methodist University.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about extremely high prices or maybe even shortages,\u201d she said. 'Ticking time bomb': Texas companies reel from Trump's sprawling trade war even amid a tariff truce\nFarmers, manufacturers and others that count on Mexico as a key market would also feel the pain. The \u201cimpact would be immediate,\u201d and a long shutdown could lead to \u201ceconomic devastation\u201d said Tony Bennett of the Texas Association of Manufacturers.\nConsider the auto industry, which has footholds in Texas like Toyota\u2019s North American headquarters in Plano and General Motors\u2019 assembly plant in Arlington.\nA border closing would \u201cresult in significant disruptions to the North American auto industry,\u201d partly because \u201cauto parts can cross the border seven to eight times before being integrated into the final assembly of a vehicle,\u201d said an Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers spokesman.\nMexico is the No. 1 source for auto parts imported into the U.S., said Kristin Dziczek, an expert at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan. Those parts aren\u2019t \u201c10-penny nails that you can get from anywhere,\" she said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you make a contingency plan around shutting off all of Mexico,\u201d she said.\nOne key component the industry gets almost exclusively from Mexico, for instance, is a wire harness that helps bundle cords into doors and instrument panels, Dziczek said.\nThat may sound like a small thing. But the car can\u2019t be completed without it. If the car can\u2019t be completed, then the production line has to be shut down. If production is shut down, then other suppliers, even those who don\u2019t rely on parts from Mexico, also have to shut down.\n\u201cThere are probably auto companies that will be down within a shift or two,\u201d Dziczek said. \u201cIt won\u2019t take much more than a week to shut down the whole industry.\u201d\nIn short, the system unravels without Mexico\u2019s participation. Substantial layoffs and slowed economic growth would be all but certain if a shutdown were to last very long, experts said.

(Ryan Michalesko/Staff Photographer)\nEl Paso is on edge.\nAt a gas station, Rogelio Benavides, 32, scrolled through his phone to check on his wife, who was in Ciudad Juarez for a dental appointment Monday. His mother-in-law lives there, too.\n\u201cI told her, \u2018Baby, come back home. You don\u2019t know what this man will do at any minute,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to Trump. \u201cHe might shut the border and you\u2019ll be stuck there in Juarez for God knows how long.\u201d\nEl Paso and Juarez, just across the Rio Grande, are connected at the hip. Not only do families live on both sides of the border, but they shop and work on both sides, too.\nEl Paso Mayor Dee Margo pointed to an outlet mall Monday as an example of those ties. Last year, he said, the mall generated about $9.1 million in revenue. Nearly half of the clients were from Mexico.\n\u201cEconomically, a shutdown would be a killer,\u201d he said, adding that some 23,000 pedestrians commute to work in El Paso daily. \u201cThe impact would be devastating.\u201d\nAlready some Border Patrol agents have been transferred away from the bridges to deal with the migrant crisis, leading to long lines, and, \u201cI\u2019m very worried about how this is impacting our city,\u201d said Margo.\nAnd Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen says she may reassign as many as 2,000 agents, up from the 750 announced last week.\n\u201cThe government shutdown really hurt us,\u201d Margo said, noting the huge military and federal presence in El Paso. \u201cA border shutdown will essentially wipe us out.\u201d\nThe only near equivalent to what Trump is proposing came in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when ongoing security concerns prompted President George W. Bush\u2019s administration to order 100 percent inspections at ports of entry.\nThe effort turned into a quagmire, effectively shutting down the border with massive lines.\n\u201cWe realized in that instant just how really vital to both of our economies and societies that a functioning border was,\u201d said Wilson, the Wilson Center expert.\nIn downtown El Paso, shoppers on Monday were readjusting their plans.\nMargie Fuentes, 31, was going to have dinner with a friend from across the border this week, but when she checked an app and saw that pedestrian lines were about three hours long, said, \u201cI\u2019m thinking breakfast or lunch may be better.\u201d\n\u201cThis is insane,\u201d she added. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand that we\u2019re really one city.\u201d\nAnd, in a sense, one economy, too.\nBennett of the Texas Association of Manufacturers said a shutdown could lead to a domino effect, due to the \u201csymbiotic\u201d nature of North American supply chains.\n\u201cThere is more harm to be done than good,\u201d he said.\nTom Benning reported from Washington, and Alfredo Corchado reported from El Paso.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "subscri", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T02:24:36.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7d9ca8cf8d19bd9a31c1ef9f72715030dd5ca152", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/50-cent-finally-sells-his-52-room-connecticut-mansion-at-a-huge-discount-2019-04-01?siteid=rss&rss=1", "site_full": "www.marketwatch.com", "site": "marketwatch.com", "site_section": "http://www.marketwatch.com/rss/topstories", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "MarketWatch.com - Top Stories", "title": "50 Cent finally sells his 52-room Connecticut mansion, at a huge discount", "title_full": "50 Cent finally sells his 52-room Connecticut mansion, at a huge discount - MarketWatch", "published": "2019-04-02T02:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GC400_50cent_ZG_20180124175615.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 900, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7d9ca8cf8d19bd9a31c1ef9f72715030dd5ca152", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/50-cent-finally-sells-his-52-room-connecticut-mansion-at-a-huge-discount-2019-04-01?siteid=rss&rss=1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Katherine Clarke", "published": "2019-04-02T02:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "50 Cent finally sells his 52-room Connecticut mansion, at a huge discount", "text": "Getty Images 50 Cent attends a movie premiere in Los Angeles in January 2018. One of Connecticut\u2019s better known white elephants \u2014 rapper 50 Cent\u2019s massive Farmington mansion \u2014has finally traded for $2.9 million, or 84% less than what it first sought 12 years ago, according to people familiar with the deal.\nThe musician, whose birth name is Curtis James Jackson III, purchased the property from former boxer Mike Tyson for $4.1 million in 2003, property records show. That deal set a still-standing record for the most expensive home ever sold in Farmington, which is about 80 miles north of Greenwich, according to appraiser Jonathan Miller. The property first listed in 2007, then underwent several price cuts over the years and was listed by various different agencies. Most recently it was seeking for $4.995 million, according to Zillow. It had also been listed for rent at $100,000 a month.\nApproximately 50,000-square-foot, the 52-room compound is much larger with other homes in the town of Farmington. The original listing pictures show a basketball court with the logo for Jackson\u2019s G-Unit hip hop group, and a night club decorated with murals depicting Jackson\u2019s large back tattoo and of him wearing a bedazzled cross medallion and pointing a gun. The house also has game rooms, a recording studio, a home theater, an indoor pool and a conference center.\nThe estate was costing the rapper almost $70,000 a month to carry, including property taxes and mortgage payments, according to documents related to his Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in 2015. He managed to hold onto the house despite his financial difficulties several years ago.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\nAramco emerges ahead of Apple as world\u2019s most profitable company.\nNew York\u2019s congestion-pricing system will serve as road test for other cities.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-yorks-congestion-pricing-system-will-serve-as-road-test-for-other-cities-11554122682?mod=mktw", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/50-cent-sells-massive-connecticut-compound-for-84-less-11554152164?mod=mktw", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/aramco-is-the-most-profitable-company-on-earth-ratings-agencies-say-11554102173?mod=mktw", "https://b2c-banner.marketing.moveaws.com/welcome/banner/localsearch/localsearch.php"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "50 cent", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jonathan miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "curtis james jackson iii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike tyson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "getty images", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "zillow", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "farmington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenwich", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T02:44:21.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2abcb8e55c69643f2e4c54f7c87c10950af6e1cd", "url": "https://www.fxstreet.com/news/aud-usd-50-day-sma-could-challenge-recovery-from-07100-rba-in-focus-201904012337", "site_full": "www.fxstreet.com", "site": "fxstreet.com", "site_section": "http://xml.fxstreet.com/index.xml", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Forex News", "title": "AUD/USD: 50-day SMA could challenge recovery from 0.7100, RBA in focus", "title_full": "AUD/USD: 50-day SMA could challenge recovery from 0.7100, RBA in focus", "published": "2019-04-02T02:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://editorial.azureedge.net/images/Markets/Currencies/Majors/AUDUSD/australian-coins-3660349_Large.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9758, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2abcb8e55c69643f2e4c54f7c87c10950af6e1cd", "url": "https://www.fxstreet.com/news/aud-usd-50-day-sma-could-challenge-recovery-from-07100-rba-in-focus-201904012337", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T02:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "AUD/USD: 50-day SMA could challenge recovery from 0.7100, RBA in focus", "text": "| By Anil Panchal Optimism surrounding its largest consumer China and upbeat US yields entertain Aussie buyers ahead of the RBA. The central bank is less likely to offer any change in its monetary policy but its future policy bias will be closely observed.\nAUD/USD is on the bids near 0.7110 during early Tuesday. The Aussie recovered from 0.7100 round-figure as the US Dollar (USD) witnessed profit-booking moves against the majority of its counterparts. In spite of ticking up to the highest in a week during early Monday, the quote failed to clear 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at the day-end as the US Dollar (USD) became buyers\u2019 choice on welcome data reducing previously feared recession into the US economy.\nThe Australian Dollar (AUD) remains strong so far since the day start as Aussie traders followed positive Chinese data, the US stock market gains and rising yields in order to drive the currency upwards ahead of the RBA meeting.\nWestpac reported that AU bond yields are higher following the surge in UST yields overnight. AU 10yr yields moved almost 6bp to 1.87%, while 3yr yields added 3.5bp to reach 1.405% \u2013 steepening the curve to 46.5bp. While mirroring UST price action, AU 10yr found some support ahead of today\u2019s Federal Budget and the AU-US 10yr spread narrowed to -63.3bp. Ahead of today\u2019s RBA meeting, the market is pricing 96% chance of a cut in August with a \u2018terminal rate\u2019 of 1.04% reached by June next year.\nWhile welcome prints of China\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) pleased the Aussie buyers at the week-start, they failed to sustain the gains as traders preferred the US Dollar after upbeat ISM manufacturing PMI signaled fewer chances of the US recession.\nLooking forward, monetary policy meeting by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) gains immediate attention of the AUD/USD pair\u2019s traders. The Australian central bank is less likely to offer any change in its present monetary policy with 1.5% cash rate while expectedly offering a neutral policy bias. However, some at the desks expect recent recovery in China data and likely chances of the US-China trade deal playing their part to push the RBA policymakers towards a bit hawkish statement.\nIt should also be observed that February month Australian building permits could offer intermediate moves ahead of the RBA. The housing market indicator is likely to have slipped by -1.0% compared to +2.5% previous growth on a monthly basis.\nOn the other hand, the US Durable goods orders for February will entertain AUD/USD traders after the RBA meeting. The order growth may contract to -1.8% from the previously revised figure of +0.3% whereas the Non-defense capital goods orders ex-aircraft may stall around 0.0% from +0.8% prior.\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis\nNot only a daily close beyond 50-day SMA level of 0.7120 but a successful break of 0.7155 resistance-confluence comprising 100-day SMA and a six-week-old descending trend-line could also challenge Aussie buyers.\nOn the downside, 50% Fibonacci retracement of December 2018 to January 2019 decline, at 0.7060, could offer strong support to the pair during its drop, failing to which highlights 0.7000 and 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of 0.6980 as crucial levels to watch.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

The yield curve is just keeping score on how the Fed is reacting to and influencing these cycles. So why do inverted yield curves have such a good track record in calling recessions , and could it be different this time ?\n: The yield curve inverted \u2014 here are 5 things investors need to know\nAccording to a July 2018 Fed study about the yield curve, the probability of a recession was around 14%. However, a February 2019 update of this study reported that the odds had risen to 50%. That recession warning might have contributed to the remarkable pivot from a hawkish to a dovish stance by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets the Fed\u2019s monetary policy.\nThe Fed recently signaled that there won\u2019t be any rate hikes this year and only one next year. If so, this should reduce the chances of a recession. Let\u2019s have a close look at the Fed study, which confirms our view about the best interpretation of the yield curve:\nLast year, the minutes of the June 12-13 FOMC meeting offered a reason not to worry about the flattening yield curve at that time. During the meeting, Fed staff presented an alternative \u201cindicator of the likelihood of recession\u201d based on research explained in a June 28 FEDS Notes titled \u201c(Don't Fear) The Yield Curve\u201d by two Fed economists, Eric C. Engstrom and Steven A. Sharpe. In brief, they questioned why a \u201clong-term spread\u201d between the 10-year (BX:TMUBMUSD10Y) and two-year (BX:TMUBMUSD02Y) Treasury notes should have much power to predict imminent recessions. As an alternative, they devised a 0- to-6-quarter \u201cnear-term forward spread\u201d based on the spread between the current level of the federal-funds rate and the expected federal-funds rate several quarters ahead, derived from futures market prices ( Fig. 1 ).\nThe authors stressed that the long-term spread reflects the near-term spread, which they argue makes more sense as an indicator of a recession that is expected to occur within the next few quarters. They also observe that an inversion of either yield spread does not mean that the spread causes recessions.\nAt the time, their assessment was that \u2018the market is putting fairly low odds on a rate cut over the next four quarters,\u2019 i.e., 14.1% ( Fig. 2 ). \u201cUnlike far-term yield spreads, the near-term forward spread has not been trending down in recent years, and survey-based measures of longer-term expectations for short term interest rates show no sign of an expected inversion,\u201d they observed. In our commentary last year, we concluded: \u201cWhat a relief! So now, all we have to worry about is a recession caused by a trade war!\u201d\n(provided by The Street)\nClick to expand Replay Video UP NEXT Nor'easter strengthens off the East Coast An April Nor'easter is taking shape along the Carolina Coast which will impact the major metro cities of the Northeast by Wednesday.

The near-term spread \u201cpredicts four-quarter GDP growth with greater accuracy than survey consensus forecasts. Furthermore, \u201cit has substantial predictive power for stock returns,\u201d find the Fed economists. In contrast, yields on bonds \u201cmaturing beyond 6-8 quarters are shown to have no added value for forecasting either recessions, GDP growth, or stock returns.\u201d\nBuried on page 7 of the new study is a warning that the probability of a recession had increased significantly since the original study was done about a year ago: \u201cAs of the end of the sample period in early 2019 (and the time of this writing), the near term forward spreads forecast a substantially elevated probability of a recession.\u201d\nIndeed, Figure 3 in the study clearly shows that recession risk jumped to 50% (based on first-quarter 2019 data available only through January). Interestingly, this important update wasn\u2019t mentioned in the summary paragraph at the beginning of the study. However, the charts in the paper show that the odds of a recession increase most significantly when the near-term forward spread is markedly below zero, which it was not as of the most recent analysis.\nAccordingly, we\u2019re not freaking out about an impending recession. We are focusing on the idea promoted in the Fed study (and in my book) that the yield curve first and foremost is predicting the outlook for monetary policy. For example, the paper noted that \u201cthe near-term forward spread would tend to turn negative when investors decide that the Fed is likely to soon switch from a tightening to an easing stance.\u201d\nThe yield-curve spread tends to narrow during periods when the Fed is raising the federal-funds rate ( Fig. 3 ). It tends to bottom and then widen when the Fed starts to lower interest rates. It just so happens that past recessions occurred after the yield curve inverted, i.e., at the tail end of monetary tightening cycles.\nIt might be different this time, if the Fed has paused on a timely basis from raising interest rates any further, thus reducing the chances of a recession. After all, there\u2019s no need to overdo tightening given that inflation and speculative excesses remain subdued. In the past, Fed tightening (not inverted yield curves that coincided with tightening) led to financial crises, which morphed into widespread credit crunches, resulting in recessions ( Fig. 4 ).\nHence our conclusion that it is credit crunches that cause recessions, not inverted yield curves and not aging expansions.\nDrawing parallels between monetary policy in 1998 and today, Engstrom\u2019s and Sharpe\u2019s paper stated: \u201cThe most prominent false positive during our sample came with the anticipated easing triggered by the spread of the Asian financial crises in 1998, which did not result in a recession in the U.S. It is not hard to imagine that similar scenarios could generate additional false positives in the future. The near-inversion of the near term forward spread at the end of 2018 seems to have been associated with market perceptions of significant risks to the global economic outlook, including the threat of escalating trade disputes. Whether those risks manifest in a recession remains to be seen.\u201d\nThe Fed study notes: \u201cWe define the near-term forward spread on any given day as the difference between the implied interest rate expected on a three-month Treasury bill six quarters ahead and the current yield on a three-month Treasury bill.\u201d\nAccording to Haver Analytics (our data vendor): \u201cWe had been in touch with the Board about the 0-to-6 Quarter Forward Spread earlier this year and they had told us they calculated it using an internal fitted zero coupon curve in quarterly maturities. They only make annual maturities available at the moment so we cannot calculate.\u201d\nSo instead of trying to calculate the Fed study\u2019s near-term spread, we will focus on the 12-month forward futures for the federal-funds rate, which is available daily ( Fig. 5 ). The two-year Treasury note yield tracks this series closely, suggesting that it is also a good proxy for the market\u2019s prediction of the federal-funds rate a year from now.\nAfter all that work, the conclusion is the obvious one: The Fed isn\u2019t likely to be raising the federal-funds rate over the next 12 months. Last Monday, the 12-month forward rate was 2.06%, 32 basis points below the 2.38% midpoint of the federal-funds rate target range. The two-year was 2.24%, 14 basis points below the midpoint late last week.\nThe Fed study suggests to us that the spread between the two-year Treasury yield and the federal-funds rate may be the simplest way to track the fixed-income market\u2019s outlook for monetary policy over the next 52 weeks ( Fig. 6 ). Anyone can do this at home. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the market will be right, as evidenced by how wrong it turned out to be last year.\nThe bottom line: For now, we still don\u2019t see a significant risk of a recession, especially since the FOMC remains \u201cpatient.\u201d The committee\u2019s recent decision to pause hiking the federal-funds rate over the rest of this year reduces the risk of a financial crisis triggering both a credit crunch and a recession.\nEd Yardeni is president of Yardeni Research, Inc.

As an alternative, they devised a 0- to-6-quarter \u201cnear-term forward spread\u201d based on the spread between the current level of the federal-funds rate and the expected federal-funds rate several quarters ahead, derived from futures market prices ( Fig. 1 ).\nThe authors stressed that the long-term spread reflects the near-term spread, which they argue makes more sense as an indicator of a recession that is expected to occur within the next few quarters. They also observe that an inversion of either yield spread does not mean that the spread causes recessions.\nAt the time, their assessment was that \u2018the market is putting fairly low odds on a rate cut over the next four quarters,\u2019 i.e., 14.1% ( Fig. 2 ). \u201cUnlike far-term yield spreads, the near-term forward spread has not been trending down in recent years, and survey-based measures of longer-term expectations for short term interest rates show no sign of an expected inversion,\u201d they observed. In our commentary last year, we concluded: \u201cWhat a relief! So now, all we have to worry about is a recession caused by a trade war!\u201d\n(provided by The Street)\nClick to expand Replay Video UP NEXT Trump moves to vastly expand offshore drilling Trump moves to vastly expand offshore drilling USA TODAY Jeff Bezos security chief: Saudis involved in hack of Amazon CEO's cellphone The National Enquirer's parent company, AMI, is denying a report that the Saudi government hacked into the cellphone of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.

Fox Business 2:15 See how this family travels the world for next to nothing GOBankingRates 1:47 UP NEXT The updated Fed study dated February 2019 has a less jazzy title: \u201cThe Near-Term Forward Yield Spread as a Leading Indicator: A Less Distorted Mirror.\u201d The authors observe that their near-term spread \u201ccan be interpreted as a measure of the market's expectations for the near-term trajectory of conventional monetary policy rates.\u201d\nIn addition, they report: \u201cIts predictive power suggests that, when market participants expected \u2014 and priced in \u2014 a monetary policy easing over the subsequent year and a half, a recession\u201d was likely forthcoming. The near-term spread \u201cpredicts four-quarter GDP growth with greater accuracy than survey consensus forecasts. Furthermore, \u201cit has substantial predictive power for stock returns,\u201d find the Fed economists. In contrast, yields on bonds \u201cmaturing beyond 6-8 quarters are shown to have no added value for forecasting either recessions, GDP growth, or stock returns.\u201d\nBuried on page 7 of the new study is a warning that the probability of a recession had increased significantly since the original study was done about a year ago: \u201cAs of the end of the sample period in early 2019 (and the time of this writing), the near term forward spreads forecast a substantially elevated probability of a recession.\u201d\nIndeed, Figure 3 in the study clearly shows that recession risk jumped to 50% (based on first-quarter 2019 data available only through January). Interestingly, this important update wasn\u2019t mentioned in the summary paragraph at the beginning of the study. However, the charts in the paper show that the odds of a recession increase most significantly when the near-term forward spread is markedly below zero, which it was not as of the most recent analysis.\nAccordingly, we\u2019re not freaking out about an impending recession. We are focusing on the idea promoted in the Fed study (and in my book) that the yield curve first and foremost is predicting the outlook for monetary policy. For example, the paper noted that \u201cthe near-term forward spread would tend to turn negative when investors decide that the Fed is likely to soon switch from a tightening to an easing stance.\u201d\nThe yield-curve spread tends to narrow during periods when the Fed is raising the federal-funds rate ( Fig. 3 ). It tends to bottom and then widen when the Fed starts to lower interest rates. It just so happens that past recessions occurred after the yield curve inverted, i.e., at the tail end of monetary tightening cycles.\nIt might be different this time, if the Fed has paused on a timely basis from raising interest rates any further, thus reducing the chances of a recession. After all, there\u2019s no need to overdo tightening given that inflation and speculative excesses remain subdued. In the past, Fed tightening (not inverted yield curves that coincided with tightening) led to financial crises, which morphed into widespread credit crunches, resulting in recessions ( Fig. 4 ).\nHence our conclusion that it is credit crunches that cause recessions, not inverted yield curves and not aging expansions.\nDrawing parallels between monetary policy in 1998 and today, Engstrom\u2019s and Sharpe\u2019s paper stated: \u201cThe most prominent false positive during our sample came with the anticipated easing triggered by the spread of the Asian financial crises in 1998, which did not result in a recession in the U.S. It is not hard to imagine that similar scenarios could generate additional false positives in the future. The near-inversion of the near term forward spread at the end of 2018 seems to have been associated with market perceptions of significant risks to the global economic outlook, including the threat of escalating trade disputes. Whether those risks manifest in a recession remains to be seen.\u201d\nThe Fed study notes: \u201cWe define the near-term forward spread on any given day as the difference between the implied interest rate expected on a three-month Treasury bill six quarters ahead and the current yield on a three-month Treasury bill.\u201d\nAccording to Haver Analytics (our data vendor): \u201cWe had been in touch with the Board about the 0-to-6 Quarter Forward Spread earlier this year and they had told us they calculated it using an internal fitted zero coupon curve in quarterly maturities. They only make annual maturities available at the moment so we cannot calculate.\u201d\nSo instead of trying to calculate the Fed study\u2019s near-term spread, we will focus on the 12-month forward futures for the federal-funds rate, which is available daily ( Fig. 5 ). The two-year Treasury note yield tracks this series closely, suggesting that it is also a good proxy for the market\u2019s prediction of the federal-funds rate a year from now.\nAfter all that work, the conclusion is the obvious one: The Fed isn\u2019t likely to be raising the federal-funds rate over the next 12 months. Last Monday, the 12-month forward rate was 2.06%, 32 basis points below the 2.38% midpoint of the federal-funds rate target range. The two-year was 2.24%, 14 basis points below the midpoint late last week.\nThe Fed study suggests to us that the spread between the two-year Treasury yield and the federal-funds rate may be the simplest way to track the fixed-income market\u2019s outlook for monetary policy over the next 52 weeks ( Fig. 6 ). Anyone can do this at home. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the market will be right, as evidenced by how wrong it turned out to be last year.\nThe bottom line: For now, we still don\u2019t see a significant risk of a recession, especially since the FOMC remains \u201cpatient.\u201d The committee\u2019s recent decision to pause hiking the federal-funds rate over the rest of this year reduces the risk of a financial crisis triggering both a credit crunch and a recession.\nEd Yardeni is president of Yardeni Research, Inc.

The permits had gone up by 2.5 percent in January.\nThe annualized figure, however, came in at -12.5 percent, marking a big drop from the preceding month's 28.6 percent rise and has likely taken the shine of the big beat in month-on-month number.\nFurther, the above-forecast month-on-month figure may not alleviate concerns of a housing market slowdown, as data released last week showed the housing credit growth hit a record low in February.

Both of those changes are proving contentious among some lawyers.\n\"We are now living in an environment where certain British Columbians are being treated differently than everyone else and we say that's discriminatory,\" said Trial Lawyers Association of British Columbia vice-president, John Rice.\nThe lawyers are mounting a constitutional challenge arguing the changes may violate the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\nOne of the group\u2019s concerns is how the system will work for people with varying injuries.\n\"If you suffer serious soft tissue injuries, a jaw injury, chronic pain ... your injuries can be artificially capped for compensation,\" said Rice. \"Whereas if you suffer a fracture, for example, a hairline fracture to your pinky, you have no such restrictions.\"\nThe TLABC \u2013 whose members may be cut out of the new tribunal system -- also believes the civil resolution tribunal system is unconstitutional as it may restrict access to the court system for some.\nFormer B.C. premier and attorney general Ujjal Dosanjh is also supporting the TLABC\u2019s legal action. He told CTV Monday that the changes will hurt both ordinary and disadvantaged British Columbians.\n\"They're now saying we'll give you higher rates for insurance but fewer rights to go to court and cap your damages arbitrarily,\" said Dosanjh by phone.\nICBC told CTV News on Friday it had been expecting some kind of legal challenge. It\u2019s estimated the changes that take effect April 1 will save ICBC about $1 billion a year.\n\"If we hadn't made this change we would have seen a 40 percent increase in rates this year,\" said ICBC president and CEO Nicolas Jimenez.\nAttorney General David Eby echoed those thoughts Monday, adding he understood why the association was upset about the changes.\n\"But the reality is we don't have a choice in terms of ensuring that costs are affordable for British Columbians,\" Eby told reporters in Victoria.\nFor Dosanjh, the question is whether ICBC is doing what it was meant to -- providing affordable insurance to all British Columbians. He added if the government can\u2019t figure out how to provide insurance in a financially appropriate way, it should abandon the field.\nAn interim rate increase of 6.3 per cent approved by the BC Utilities Commission means an average insurance bill for the year will go up by about $60.\nThe province is expected to announce further cost-saving measures later this year.\n\u201cThis should be about protecting the public interest \u2014 not about protecting ICBC.\u201d - Ron Nairn, with TLABC.

Albert Delitala takes a look at the money being spent as the campaign trail heats up in Alberta. Listen\nThe ongoing Alberta general election campaign has given a boost to parts of the province\u2019s economy, with millions of dollars in spending expected by the parties, candidates and third parties.\nEdmonton-based Bannerz Canada Inc. has had its printers running nearly non-stop, 24-hours-a-day since the writ dropped. They print lawn signs, banners, vehicle wraps and more for most of the major parties. Edmonton councillor sends letter to Alberta election candidates to address mobile home problem\nThe company had seen business slow in recent months, according to owner Karandeep Grewal, but the election has meant a jump in sales, with the production of an estimated 30,000 lawn signs expected by the end of the campaign.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really good. If you see my guys, they\u2019ve been really pumped and happy,\u201d Grewal said. \u201cIt feels great to have all that extra work coming in.\u201d\nIn the 2015 general election, the parties spent more than $7.5 million altogether, according to Elections Alberta. The Progressive Conservatives spent $4.3 million of that amount, followed by the NDP with $1.6 million and the Wildrose Party with $1.2 million. Spending limits\nUnlike the previous general election campaign, spending by political parties during the 28-day writ period is now capped at $2 million, courtesy of the Fair Elections Financing Act, introduced by the NDP in November 2016. Candidates are limited to spending $50,000.\nDonations from unions and corporations have also since been banned, replaced by registered third-party interest groups. They can each spend up to $150,000 during the writ period.\n\u201cThere are dozens of [third-party interest groups] that are all participating in raising and spending money in this campaign,\u201d said Justin Archer, a former political operative and who is now a partner with Berlin Communications. \u201cI think this will be the most expensive election campaign in Alberta\u2019s history.\u201d\nReported spending totals for the 2019 general election will be posted to the financial disclosures section of the Elections Alberta website.\nGet daily local headlines and alerts \u00a9 2019 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

(Representational Image)\nSince the state of Maharashtra came into being in the 60s, a total of 566 Members of Parliament (MPs) have been elected from the state. And, in a state where one out of every tenth person is a Muslim, of these 566 MPs only 14 or less than 2.5 per cent were Muslims. Advertising\nOver the years, Muslims have found themselves increasingly sidelined in electoral politics in the state with political parties hesitant to give them tickets. In the last three elections held in Maharashtra, major political parties have fielded only four Muslim candidates. The Congress fielded one in 2004, NCP and Congress one each in 2009 and one candidate by the Congress in 2014. This year too only one Muslim candidate, Hidayat Patel, has been fielded by the Congress in Akola.\nThis gradual denial of representation has seen a gradual shift by the community from the Congress-NCP to Muslim-centric parties like the AIMIM. In some cases, Muslims have also preferred siding with the BJP and Shiv Sena .\nAn obvious case for Muslim representation proportionate to the community\u2019s population is that only this can ensure the effective implementation of minority rights. However, the case is also often made that even non-Muslims in secular parties can and have ensured that minority rights are protected. The corollary is that Muslim MPs, especially affiliated to secular parties, may not even consider themselves as representing only their community.\nNonetheless, there is a growing perception in the community that it is increasingly becoming difficult for a Muslim candidate to find acceptance outside his community. Click here for more election news\nThe last time a Muslim MP won from Maharashtra was in 2004 when A R Antulay won from Kolaba. The constituency has a Muslim population of less than 8 per cent and Antulay is said to have managed to win based on his own extensive political network in the region. Latest Videos Here is what people have to say about Congress\u2019s manifesto\nTill 1984, Muslim politicians were getting elected from rural and mixed-population constituencies including Jalgaon, Akola, Wardha, Chanda and Ratnagiri. Since 1990, the growing communal schism has meant that it has become difficult for Muslim candidates to find support from non-Muslim voters.\nMaharashtra\u2019s 1.30 crore Muslims make up 11.56 per cent of the state\u2019s 11.24 crore population. It does, however, have a slightly higher concentration in Northern Konkan, Khandesh, Marathwada and Western Vidarbha. In 14 Lok Sabha constituencies where they make up between 14 and 25 per cent of the electorate, Muslims voters will have a say. They are Dhule, Nanded, Parbhani, Latur, Aurangabad , Bhiwandi, Akola, Thane and the six seats of Mumbai.

Domestic economic data were more mixed, with U.S. manufacturing activity accelerating but retail sales falling 0.2% in February. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJINDICES:^DJI ) and the S&P 500 ( SNPINDEX:^GSPC ) both gained more than 1%.\nToday's stock market Index Percentage Change Point Change Dow 1.27% 329.74 S&P 500 1.16% 32.79 Data source: Yahoo! Finance.\nAs for individual stocks, Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) gave up on the AirPower charging mat and lowered prices in China, and Kellogg ( NYSE:K ) is divesting sweet snack product lines.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nApple axes AirPower, cuts prices in China Apple investors got a mixed bag of news today, with the company canceling the AirPower charging mat and reducing prices in China. Shares crept up 0.7%.\nThe cancellation of AirPower amounts to an embarrassment for Apple, but probably won't have much of an impact on financial results. The company announced AirPower in September 2017 as part of the iPhone X unveiling and said it would be available in 2018. Apparently the product development hit some technical snags, so iPhone users will continue to rely on third-party devices for wireless charging.\nMore important to the company's future results was a price cut to iPhone products in China, as reported by CNBC . The price of the entry-level iPhone X model, the XR, was lowered 4.6%, and the price tags on the XS and XS Max were cut 5.7% and 5.2%, respectively.\nA shortfall in China sales took Apple by surprise and caused a rare downward revision in guidance in January. This week's price action may help revive the iPhone business there, and a cut in China's value-added tax from 16% to 13%, which went into effect today, should ease the profit impact on Apple.\nKellogg cuts back on sweets Kellogg is getting out of the cookie business, announcing today that it is selling those brands, along with fruit-flavored snacks, pie crust, and ice cream cone product lines to Italian confection company Ferrero Group for $1.3 billion. Kellogg shares fell 2.4%.\nThe divestiture includes cookie brands such as Keebler, Mother's, Famous Amos, and cookies the company makes for Girl Scouts. Ferrero Group makes chocolates, Nutella, and Tic Tac breath mints.\nKellogg had already announced it was looking for a buyer for those businesses as it tries to reshape its portfolio by investing in new brands in areas such as digestive health and natural foods and reviving existing brands. The affected products accounted for net sales of almost $900 million in 2018 out of total sales of $13.5 billion. The U.S. snack segment of the company suffered a sales decline of nearly 5% last year, and Kellogg thinks divesting parts of that business will help it deliver organic growth of 1% to 2% in 2019, up from a flat performance last year.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/01/apple-slashes-iphone-prices-in-china-by-as-much-as-5percent.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "getty images", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kellogg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "index percentage change point change dow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gspc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T05:01:00.033+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "df918c7db53e19227ee9176ba5c1fb8a651abd35", "url": "https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?oid=091&aid=0007172741", "site_full": "news.naver.com", "site": "naver.com", "site_section": "https://openapi.naver.com/v1/search/news?query=l&start=120&sort=date&display=100", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "", "title": "GERMANY ECONOMY HANNOVER INDUSTRY FAIR", "title_full": "GERMANY ECONOMY HANNOVER INDUSTRY FAIR : \ub124\uc774\ubc84 \ub274\uc2a4", "published": "2019-04-01T13:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "KR", "spam_score": 0.027, "main_image": "https://imgnews.pstatic.net/image/origin/091/2019/04/01/7172741.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 89, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "df918c7db53e19227ee9176ba5c1fb8a651abd35", "url": "https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?oid=091&aid=0007172741", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EPA\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4 | \ub124\uc774\ubc84", "published": "2019-04-01T13:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "GERMANY ECONOMY HANNOVER INDUSTRY FAIR", "text": "Hannover Industry Fair starts in Hanover\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel (2-L) and Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Loefven at the booth of the partner country Sweden northern Main EPA/JENS SCHLUETER\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.yna.co.kr/video/index?site=navi_visual_dep02&did=1195s", "https://hng.yonhapnews.co.kr/?site=hng_tit&did=1195s"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "angela merkel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hannover messe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stefan loefven", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epa/jens schlueter", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanover", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T05:03:42.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c956815caa8abd61bf373a9c8a1677cf96b68385", "url": "https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/additional-support-called-for-taiwan-stock-market-1028076499", "site_full": "markets.businessinsider.com", "site": "businessinsider.com", "site_section": "https://markets.businessinsider.com/news", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance", "options"], "section_title": "Stock Market News | Financial &amp; Business News | Markets Insider", "title": "Additional Support Called For Taiwan Stock Market", "title_full": "Additional Support Called For Taiwan Stock Market | Markets Insider", "published": "2019-04-01T16:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 283, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c956815caa8abd61bf373a9c8a1677cf96b68385", "url": "https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/additional-support-called-for-taiwan-stock-market-1028076499", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "RTTNews", "published": "2019-04-01T16:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Additional Support Called For Taiwan Stock Market", "text": "(RTTNews) - The Taiwan stock market has moved higher in back-to-back trading days, gathering more than 100 points or 1 percent along the way.

Tax cuts, therefore, could help boost spending, although that is unlikely to deter RBA from adopting an easing bias in the coming months, as the economy seems to be facing a perfect storm of record household debt and falling property values.\nWestpac expects the RBA to move to a clear easing bias following the May meeting. However, it is unlikely that there will be any hints of this action in the April Governor\u2019s Statement.\nAnalysts at TD securities are of the opinion that the Bank can afford to assess developments over coming months - the next read on consumption is Q1 GDP on 5th June.\nAll-in-all, today's rate decision may not move the needle on the Aussie pairs unless the central bank downgrades its language on the labor market, in which case the AUD will likely take a beating across the board.\nThat said, AUD/USD is sidelined in the range of 0.7170-0.7050 since March 20 - a sign the RBA is not expected to deliver a hawkish/dovish surprise ahead of the budget announcement. As of writing, the spot is trading largely unchanged at 0.7107. RBA Preview: Rates likely to be on hold\nAbout the RBA rate decision\nRBA Interest Rate Decision is announced by the Reserve Bank of Australia . If the RBA is hawkish about the inflationary outlook of the economy and raises the interest rates it is positive, or bullish, for the AUD. Likewise, if the RBA has a dovish view on the Australian economy and keeps the ongoing interest rate, or cuts the interest rate it is seen as negative, or bearish.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

The pair fell from mid-1.34 handle to mid-1.33 handle, post the decline the pair saw rangebound price action as Loonie received support from both macro data update and positive crude oil price in the global market. When trading session opened for the week, the pair resumed its trading activity well near Friday\u2019s lows and traded range bound in the early Asian session.\nCanadian GDP Update & Crude Oil Price Underpin Loonie Bulls Optimism surrounding Sino-U.S. trade deal and headlines from China over the weekend which stated that the state council has decided to not impose tariffs on US goods in April as a sign of goodwill to the USA boosted risk appetite in the global market. Crude oil which has already been trading positive in the global market gained further momentum over Sino-U.S. trade optimism as a positive outcome could renew demand for increased crude oil in China. The prospect of increasing demand provided crude oil bulls with high positive influence helping spot US crude oil stay well above $60 per barrel across Asian and European market hours. Positive price action in crude oil helped commodity-linked currency Loonie gain strong fundamental support.\nThis helped Loonie retain its hold on price action resulting in pair declining slowly below the mid-1.33 handle. Further, increased risk appetite in the market which caused all major high-risk forex pairs to trade positive caused the US dollar to weaken in the broad market. Investors now await macro data updates for directional cues and short term profit opportunities. Canadian calendar will see the release of RBC Manufacturing PMI while US calendar will see the release of retail sales data, ISM Manufacturing PMI and Business inventories data updates. A positive outcome in US macro data will help US Greenback recover above mid-1.33 handle while negative outcome will help Loonie move below 1.3300 handle. As Canadian macro data lacks the strength to create a major impact on price action, broad-based strength of US dollar and crude oil price in the global market will set course for price action during today\u2019s American market hours.\nPlease feel free to let us know what you think in the comments below\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\nMore From FXEMPIRE: Gold Price Forecast \u2013 Gold markets looking for buyers Crude Oil Price Forecast \u2013 Crude oil markets continue to march higher AUD/USD Price Forecast \u2013 Australian dollar gapped higher to kick the week off Gold Price Prediction \u2013 Prices Move Sideways on Mixed Data USD/CAD Daily Price Forecast \u2013 Canadian Loonie Holds Fort On Weak Crude Oil GBP/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 British pound rallies to kick off the week", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "gdp update & crude oil price underpin loonie bulls", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T06:10:24.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "651127a2d160d8f76b722ec8004c029232de4583", "url": "https://www.fxstreet.com/news/gbp-usd-technical-analysis-down-030-percent-in-asia-200-day-ma-is-the-level-to-beat-for-bears-201904020238", "site_full": "www.fxstreet.com", "site": "fxstreet.com", "site_section": "http://xml.fxstreet.com/index.xml", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Forex News", "title": "GBP/USD Technical Analysis: Down 0.30 percent in Asia, 200-day MA is the level to beat for bears", "title_full": "GBP/USD Technical Analysis: Down 0.30 percent in Asia, 200-day MA is the level to beat for bears", "published": "2019-04-02T05:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://editorial.azureedge.net/images/Markets/Currencies/Majors/GBPUSD/new-twenty-pound-notes-3079030_Large.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9758, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "651127a2d160d8f76b722ec8004c029232de4583", "url": "https://www.fxstreet.com/news/gbp-usd-technical-analysis-down-030-percent-in-asia-200-day-ma-is-the-level-to-beat-for-bears-201904020238", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T05:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "GBP/USD Technical Analysis: Down 0.30 percent in Asia, 200-day MA is the level to beat for bears", "text": "; GBP/USD Technical Analysis: Down 0.30 percent in Asia, 200-day MA is the level to beat for bears | By Omkar Godbole\nGBP/USD is currently trading at 1.3064, representing a 0.30 percent drop on the day. The currency pair clocked a high and low of 1.3114 and 1.3026, respectively, earlier today.\nDespite the negative action, the outlook remains neutral as 200-day moving average (MA) support, currently at 1.3008 is intact.\nThat long-term average line has repeatedly restricted downside in the last ten days or so. In fact, the pair created a doji candle at that crucial support on Friday, signaling indecision in the market place and posted a positive follow-through with a move to 1.3150 yesterday.\nThe pair, therefore, risks rising to 1.32 this week and a convincing break below the 200-day MA line of 1.3008 is needed to revive the bearish view put forward by the lower high of 1.3269 created on March 27.

Meaning that up this point the sell-off continues to look corrective in nature. Would have to see a break lower than 1.1177-1.1156 to have confidence in a more impulsive decline. For now, it seems reasonable to watch for a base/reversal.\nView: So far not seen any evidence of an impulsive selloff. Next in focus 1.1177-1.1156. Wary of another base/reversal. Need it below there to consider momentum.\u201d\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Partial payment occurs when between 50 and 90 per cent of total bills are paid within the agreed payment terms.\nFrom a year-on-year (y-o-y) perspective, prompt payments inched up by 0.5 percentage points; slow payments increased by 0.85 percentage points and partial payments dipped slightly by 1.35 percentage points.\nAmong five sectors, construction was the only one which experienced an increase in slow payments q-o-q, while the other four - manufacturing, retail, services and wholesale - saw improvements.\n\"The rebound in payment performance should come as no surprise given that slow payments have been on a decline since Q4 2018,\" said Ms. Audrey Chia, D&B Singapore's chief executive officer.\nShe added: \"With the exception of the construction sector which has seen worsening debts from the previous quarter, the remaining sectors have experienced a decrease in slow payments. However, compared to the same quarter in 2018, we have noted a slight increase in payment delays. This could be attributed to tightening cashflows and a generally dimmer outlook among firms here.\"\nD&B compiles the figures by monitoring over 1.6 million payment transactions of firms operating through its unit SCCB.\nThe construction sector saw slow payments worsen in Q1 2019 after four straight quarters of improvement. Its slow payments rose 4.49 percentage points q-o-q to 47.72 per cent, from 43.23 per cent in Q4 2018. Y-o-y, slow payments decreased by 1.42 percentage points to 47.72 per cent.\nBuilding construction accounted for the largest increase in slow payments, up by 6.0 percentage points to 50.18 per cent in Q1 2019. The heavy construction sector also saw an increase in slow payments by 3.94 percentage points to 48.54 per cent. Meanwhile, payment delays by special trade contractors increased by 3.17 percentage points to 44.76 per cent in the first quarter.\nRelated Story Prompt payment by Singapore firms falls for 3rd straight quarter In the manufacturing sector, a 2.33 percentage points dip in slow payments was observed q-o-q to 36.65 per cent for the first quarter. Y-o-y, slow payments dipped by 0.23 percentage points to 36.65 per cent. This was due to a decrease in payment delays by manufacturers of printing and publishing, petroleum and coal products and leather products.\nIn the retail sector, slow payments fell 4.02 percentage points q-o-q to 37.73 per cent, thanks to retailers of furniture and home furnishings, apparels and accessories and food and beverage. But y-o-y, slow payments jumped by 8.75 percentage points to 37.73 per cent.\nThe service sector saw a 1.50 percentage point fall q-o-q in slow payments to 34.49 per cent, its fourth consecutive quarter of fewer slow payments. This was due to fewer payment delays within the leisure and recreation, hotels and accommodation and consumer services sub-sectors.\nY-o-y, slow payments for the services sector dropped 3.70 percentage points to 34.49 per cent.\nMeanwhile, the wholesale trade sector saw payment delays rebound slightly due to a decrease in slow payments by wholesalers of non-durable goods. Q-o-q, payment delays fell by 1.39 percentage points to 34.25 per cent for the first quarter. Y-o-y, slow payments increased by 1.47 percentage points to 34.25 per cent.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "singapore commercial credit bureau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sccb", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T06:26:06.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "76224deba9a6e15d37991f9a3454450d6c0754bb", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/market-movers-what-changed-for-d-street-while-you-were-sleeping/articleshow/68680628.cms", "site_full": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/rssfeeds/1977021501.cms", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Markets-Economic Times", "title": "stock market today: Market Movers: What changed for D-Street while you were sleeping", "title_full": "stock market today: Market Movers: What changed for D-Street while you were sleeping - The Economic Times", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-68680638,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-528405,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "76224deba9a6e15d37991f9a3454450d6c0754bb", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/market-movers-what-changed-for-d-street-while-you-were-sleeping/articleshow/68680628.cms", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "indiatimes.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "stock market today: Market Movers: What changed for D-Street while you were sleeping", "text": "NEW DELHI: Data showing a rebound in US manufacturing activity in March from a two-year low and a similar data for China on Monday suggest global slowdown fears are a bit unwarranted.

Back Trading the News: Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Interest Rate Decision\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) interest rate decision may drag on the AUD/USD exchange rate as the central bank is widely anticipated to keep the official cash rate (OCR) at the record-low of 1.50% in April.\nIt seems as though the RBA will continue to endorse a wait-and-see approach monetary policy as the central bank sees \u2018 scenarios where an increase in the cash rate would be appropriate at some point and other scenarios where a decrease in the cash rate would be appropriate. \u2019 Mixed language coming out of the RBA is likely to weigh on the Australian dollar as the central bank looks to further support the economy, and Governor Philip Lowe & Co. may continue to tame bets for higher interest rates as officials note \u2018 that there was not a strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy. \u2019\nHowever, an unexpected batch of hawkish rhetoric may trigger a bullish reaction in AUD/USD as it spurs bets for an RBA rate-hike, and a upcoming change in regime may heighten the appeal of the Australian dollar as market participants prepare for higher interest rates.

We are dealing with a crisis of how our economy is even made up. Our economy is increasingly financialized, which means we are making profits off of interest, off of leasing your phone, off of doing all these things, but we aren\u2019t producing and we aren\u2019t innovating in the way that we need to as an economy.\u201d\nCarlson, while seeming to acknowledge that his viewers weren\u2019t going to be interested in paying close attention to anything the socialist-loving congresswoman was saying, nevertheless urged them not to completely tune her out, suggesting that if they didn\u2019t want to listen to her voice, they could maybe just \u201cprint it out and read it.\u201d\n\u201cA lot of it\u2019s basically true,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither party wants to talk about this. The Republicans are in a fetal position. They just don\u2019t want to be unpopular anymore. They\u2019ll do anything not to be unpopular. The Democrats want what they\u2019ve always wanted: total and complete control over you and this country. Neither party will say that our economy, at is core, is badly distorted.\u201d\nIt sounded as though Carlson was talking about income inequality, but then he went into more detail.\n\u201cAny economy based on interest payments isn\u2019t really an economy: It\u2019s a scam,\u201d he said into the camera. \u201cHealthy countries innovate.

But Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said he's not sure \"why the Fed needs to go into panic mode\" when data are still pointing to a healthy economy. Published 11:43 PM ET Mon, 1 April 2019 Updated 12:52 AM ET Tue, 2 April 2019 CNBC.com\nEconomic data in the U.S. don't justify an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve \u2014 despite recent calls for the American central bank to do so, said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics.\nTop White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said last week that the U.S. central bank should \"immediately\" cut interest rates by 50 basis points. His comment followed a similar stance by Heritage Foundation fellow Stephen Moore , whom U.S. President Donald Trump has said he intends to nominate for a position on the Fed.\nTheir comments came after the Fed's latest decision to hold rates steady as it cut the central bank's forecasts for U.S. economic expansion and inflation. The central bank also warned of slowing growth in Europe and China .\nWhile the U.S. is indeed growing at a slower pace, economic data don't suggest the need to cut interest rates, Zandi told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday.\n\"I'm not sure why the Fed needs to go into panic mode here,\" he said. He pointed to the latest data that showed the U.S. economy was still healthy: Unemployment rate was close to a 50-year low, wage growth was strong, inflation inched closer to the Fed's target of 2 percent and the stock market looked like it could hit record levels again.\nLowering interest rates under such conditions would be \"counter-productive\" because the move could \"juice things up\" and encourage debt to build up in the economy, he explained.\nRising debt in the U.S. is a risk that Zandi flagged last year. He said \"over-borrowing\" among companies would become problematic and could send the economy into a recession.

And new Governor Shaktikanta Das is turning out to be a willing partner.\nHe is set to deliver a second consecutive 25 basis-point interest rate cut this week, according to most economists in a Bloomberg survey, reversing two hikes made by his predecessor Urjit Patel last year. Since taking over at the Reserve Bank of India in December, Das has relaxed restrictions on weak state-run banks to help spur borrowing, and allowed lenders to restructure loans to small and medium-sized businesses that are in default.\nAn RBI panel is also considering a government request to transfer more of the central bank\u2019s excess capital to the state. An increase would help plug a widening budget deficit, allowing Prime Minister Narendra Modi to fund billions of rupees in spending to rural workers, a key voting bloc.\n\u201cThe new governor is seen as more amenable to the government\u2019s wish to keep policy loose and boost growth,\u201d said Shilan Shah, senior India economist at Capital Economics Ltd. in Singapore. \u201cHeadline inflation is low and that gives the RBI room to cut, which, coming as it would just before an election, should provide a boost to sentiment.\u201d\nLower food prices have put a lid on inflation -- and even though price gains accelerated to 2.6 percent in February from 2 percent in January, they remain well below the RBI\u2019s medium-term target of 4 percent. The RBI expects inflation to stay below that threshold until the end of the year.\nWeak Consumption\nWhile the core inflation measure, which strips out volatile food and fuel prices, has been sticky above 5 percent, that may also start to inch lower as the economy slows, providing the RBI with more justification to cut interest rates.\nBenign inflation has brought into sharp focus India\u2019s high real rates of interest, which economists say can hold back investment growth in the economy. Private consumption has already taken a beating on the back of a crisis in the shadow banking sector, and recent high-frequency data point to a bumpy ride for the economy ahead.\nThe economy needs to have grown just above 6 percent in the January-March quarter to meet the government\u2019s estimate of 7 percent expansion for the 2019 fiscal year that ended on March 31. That\u2019s well below the 8.2 percent growth seen in the April-June quarter.\n\u201cOur India current activity indicator is suggesting some slowdown in the near-term,\u201d said Prachi Mishra, chief India economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in Mumbai. \u201cGrowth in India based on the current activity indicator was reported at 6.6 percent in February, down from 6.7 percent in January, and almost 1 percentage point lower than the early 2018 pace.\u201d\nThe slowdown is a setback for Modi, who was swept into office in 2014 on the back of pledges to reform the economy and create 10 million jobs each year, a promise that saw him win over India\u2019s youth.\nWhat Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say\nOur view is that the RBI -- now on a data-dependent path -- will need to lower rates further than the consensus expects. We expect the central bank to deliver two more 25 basis point reductions -- the first in April.-- Abhishek Gupta, India economistClick here to read the report\nGovernor Das is doing his part to stimulate activity, but there are risks to some of those plans, particularly his willingness to allow weak state-run banks to lend again, which contrasts with his predecessor\u2019s efforts to slowly nurse struggling lenders back to health. Das\u2019s decision risks renewing a build-up of bad loans .\n\u201cThe rapid exemption of state-run banks from the prompt corrective action suggests that Das risks swinging the pendulum too far to the other side,\" said Priyanka Kishore, head of India and Southeast Asia research at Oxford Economics Ltd. in Singapore.\n0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.ecoti.in/Ci_uQb", "http://www.ecoti.in/T6FD_b", "http://www.ecoti.in/vSsVZa", "http://www.ecoti.in/dtTc6Y"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "narendra modi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shaktikanta das", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "das", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "urjit patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shilan shah", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "anirban nag government", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reserve bank of india", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T06:52:36.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e059e6e40d0b0eff7d78a459810cfee74cd54912", "url": "https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/fundamental/daily_briefing/daily_pieces/asia_am_briefing/2019/04/02/SP-500-Uptrend-Eyed-Risks-for-AUDUSD-Tilted-to-Upside-on-RBA.html", "site_full": "www.dailyfx.com", "site": "dailyfx.com", "site_section": "https://rss.dailyfx.com/feeds/all", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "DailyFX - Feeds all", "title": "S&P 500 Uptrend Eyed, Risks for AUD/USD Tilted to Upside on RBA", "title_full": "S&P 500 Uptrend Eyed, Risks for AUD/USD Tilted to Upside on RBA", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9130, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 8}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e059e6e40d0b0eff7d78a459810cfee74cd54912", "url": "https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/fundamental/daily_briefing/daily_pieces/asia_am_briefing/2019/04/02/SP-500-Uptrend-Eyed-Risks-for-AUDUSD-Tilted-to-Upside-on-RBA.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Daniel Dubrovsky, Junior Analyst", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "S&P 500 Uptrend Eyed, Risks for AUD/USD Tilted to Upside on RBA", "text": "Markets focused on upbeat US Manufacturing PMI results AUD risks tilted higher on RBA, AUD/NZD breakout eyed\nFind out what the #1 mistake that traders make is and how you can fix it! Key FX News Monday\nThe anti-risk Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc were the worst-performing majors on Monday, sinking with a pickup market mood. Optimism began in early Monday trade where upbeat Chinese PMI data crossed the wires . S&P 500 futures rose and preceded a 1.16% rally in the index when trading began on Wall Street. That was the S&P\u2019s best performance in 3 weeks.\nSentiment picked up later in the day when better-than-expected US ISM Manufacturing PMI data crossed the wires, clocking in at 55.3 versus 54.5 expected. Softer-than-expected domestic retail sales for February were brushed aside when that was released an hour and a half earlier. Local bond yields climbed, showing a softening in dovish Fed monetary policy expectations which benefited the US Dollar .\nAs the markets transitioned into Tuesday, the British Pound tumbled after the UK Parliament yet again failed to reach a consensus for an alternative to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal . This increased the threat of a \u2018no deal\u2019 divorce with the withdrawal deadline on April 12 th fast approaching. Meanwhile, anti-fiat gold prices declined amidst a stronger Greenback, as anticipated . Tuesday\u2019s Asia Pacific Trading Session\nTop tier event risk for Tuesday\u2019s Asia Pacific session is the Reserve Bank of Australia rate decision. Overnight index swaps are pricing in about a 75% chance that the central bank could cut benchmark lending rates by the end of this year. This has followed increasingly cautious outlooks from the Fed , ECB and more recently the RBNZ . The latter now favors a cut as its next move, risking further declines in NZD .\nWith expectations of dovishness so high, the risks then for AUD/USD are arguably tilted to the upside in the event the RBA remains neutral. For some time, the central bank has continued reiterating the notion that it sees no strong case for a near-term adjustment in rates. As such, staying put would probably send the Australian Dollar rallying. Having said that, shifting away from that notion would be significant. AUD/NZD Technical Analysis\nOne of the pairs that I am closely watching is AUD/NZD . It just recently pushed above a trend-defining descending resistance line from August. Confirming another daily close above it on the chart below could carry significant bullish implications, especially if the RBA maintains its neutral outlook.

hospitals compete against online medical consultation and services platforms.\nThe Guangzhou-based company, founded five years ago, believes it can help stem the flow of doctors and patients defecting to Ping An Good Doctor, WeDoctor and other online platforms.\n\u201cOur platforms and software enable hospitals to provide more efficient and convenient services before, during and after hospital visits,\u201d the 39-year-old founder and chief executive Min Neng told the Post at an interview on the sidelines of the China Healthcare Investment Conference.\nDigitalisation is important for state hospitals because their revenues have been squeezed after Beijing capped the amount they can charge for dispensing drugs, as part of reforms to reduce treatment costs.\n\u201cIf state hospitals can provide their own online services, it would help stem the number of days their doctors spent working in private sector clinics, lured with higher pay, greater work flexibility and other incentives,\u201d said Best Ho executive director at Haici.\nIn April last year Beijing issued a circular encouraging hospitals to set up their own internet platforms to improve communications and outpatient care.\nBeijing also sanctioned online follow-up consultations and medication dispensing for some common and chronic diseases, but stipulated that first time consultation must take place in clinics or hospitals if medication is prescribed.\nServing close to 600 hospitals \u2013 including 200 of the highest-ranked hospitals in China \u2013 Haici\u2019s platform last year processed

Will we see a rebound in the March release? In the U.S., retail sales are expected to tick up to 0.3%. On Tuesday, the U.S. posts durable goods orders.\nThe Canadian dollar ended the week with strong gains, as Canada\u2019s GDP posted a gain of 0.3% in January. This beat the estimate and came after two successive declines, which has raised concerns about the health of the Canadian economy. The slowdown in the fourth quarter has forced the Bank of Canada to turn more dovish and shelve any plans of hiking interest rates. There has even been calls for a rate cut from the bank, but the GDP gain in January will lessen the pressure on the BoC to stimulate the economy.\nInvestors are keeping a close eye on the ebb and flow of the U.S.-China trade talks, which continues to affect the movement of currency markets. The negotiations between the sides continues and there have been reports of progress.

Mike Leavitt encourages state leaders to 'grab the baton' to keep tech economy booming Comments Eric Schramm Former Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt, who also served in two Cabinet positions for former President George W. Bush, helped lay the groundwork for the state's current tech boom. On Monday, April 1, 2019, he urged leaders at the Utah Technology Innovation Summit to keep investing, or bear the consequences. Related Links New report: Tech accounts for 1 in 7 Utah jobs and still on the rise\nSALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Three-term former Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt laid a lot of groundwork during his time in office that's been paying huge economic dividends for the state for the past 20-plus years.\nBut he noted in a talk Monday that the generational baton is now in the hands of new leaders, and in order to maintain the state's economic vitality, now driven in large part by the technology sector, new and decisive actions are required.\nWhile investments made in the '90s under Leavitt's administration that included upgrading infrastructure via the $4 billion Centennial Highway projects, bolstering higher education outcomes with the Utah Engineering Initiative, and aggressively recruiting out-of-area tech investment in the state, those efforts, Leavitt said, are ready for a reboot.\n\"The next leaders of this state will have to take bold risks, will have to step up and invest, will have to innovate in ways that were unnecessary for us, but this generational relay requires it,\" Leavitt said. \"The running room we created in this state is essentially gone. Leaders \u2026 will be required to update the (economic) foundations for the next 18 years.\"\nLeavitt, speaking at the Utah Technology Innovation Summit in downtown Salt Lake City on Monday, has had a storied career that's included success in the private sector before a chain of public service positions that led him from the Utah Governor's Mansion to the nation's capital. Leavitt served as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under President George W. Bush before assuming another Cabinet-level job just over a year later, also for Bush, as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nWhile at the helm of state government, Leavitt helped lead Utah's charge into the digital age with efforts to get residents wired following the advent of the internet, launching the nation's second-ever state government website and vowing to spend more time in Silicon Valley \"than California's governor\" in a running strategy to bring new innovation investment into the Beehive State.\nOne of those Bay Area pursuits involved a face-off between Utah and Arizona in a bid to secure a new facility for the, at the time, wildly popular eBay online auction platform. Leavitt said he'd done his homework on the service, including engaging in his own online sales to \"figure out how the whole thing worked.\" Turns out, that may have been a clincher on Leavitt's quest to bring the new, 400-employee office to Utah.\nAwaiting a final decision on where the new facility would be located, Leavitt pulled his trump card during phone call with eBay's then-CEO Meg Whitman.\n\"Meg, I\u2019ve got a suggestion for you on how you decide,\" Leavitt recounted telling her. \"Why don\u2019t you find out if the governor of Arizona has an eBay account \u2026 and if he does why don\u2019t you compare our customer ratings and go with the highest one.\n\"It may be coincidental, but we got the deal the next day.\"\nLeavitt's tech bona fides are numerous and include bringing semiconductor giant Micron Technology Inc. to the state in 1995, co-founding, along with former Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, one of the country's first online-only schools, Western Governor's University, and in 1997 was the first U.S. Cabinet-level official to launch a blog.\nLeavitt said the seeds of the idea behind his engineering initiative \u2014 one that more than doubled the output of engineering and computer science graduates from Utah universities and amassing some 40,000 Utah graduates in those categories since the program's launch in 2000 \u2014 were sown by a conversation with tech legend John Warnock .\nLeavitt said Warnock, a computer graphics innovator who earned his doctorate at the University of Utah before going on to participate in the first incarnation of the internet as well as co-founding software giant Adobe, highlighted what Utah was lacking, at the time, through the eyes of the relatively new, and burgeoning, U.S. high-tech industry. And, according to Leavitt, it was a dose of harsh reality.\n\"Look, you want tech jobs in Utah you\u2019ve go to have more engineers,\" Leavitt recalled of the conversation with Warnock. \"Utah isn\u2019t investing a fraction of what it needs to. Tech companies like Adobe can't come to Utah unless you fix that.\"\nYears later, Leavitt noted, the circle was completed when Adobe did come to Utah, swallowing web analytics startup Omniture in a $1.8 billion deal in 2009. Last year, the company doubled down on its committment to Utah , breaking ground on its second facility in Lehi with plans in place to double its workforce in the state.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mike leavitt", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "leavitt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "deseret news file", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deseret news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salt lake city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T08:19:23.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "27294c1fd13efcf39d5afeecb2221e50fc1a0c6f", "url": "http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201904/02/WS5ca2bd6da3104842260b3dba.html", "site_full": "www.chinadaily.com.cn", "site": "chinadaily.com.cn", "site_section": "http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business", "site_categories": ["media", "travel", "japan"], "section_title": "Business News - China Economy &amp;#38; Company - chinadaily.com.cn", "title": "Fiscal, monetary measures set to support real economy", "title_full": "Fiscal, monetary measures set to support real economy - Chinadaily.com.cn", "published": "2019-04-02T04:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CN", "spam_score": 0.04, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 73, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "27294c1fd13efcf39d5afeecb2221e50fc1a0c6f", "url": "http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201904/02/WS5ca2bd6da3104842260b3dba.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "\u674e\u9f50", "published": "2019-04-02T04:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Fiscal, monetary measures set to support real economy", "text": "Employees work at an Otis manufacturing facility in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, in September 2018. [Photo provided to China Daily] GDP growth to stay at 6.2% in first half before rebounding to 6.3%, says CASS\nChina's GDP growth is expected to stabilize at 6.2 percent during the first six months of this year, before rebounding in the September-to-December period to reach 6.3 percent whole-year growth, data from the country's leading think tank, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) showed on Monday.\nTax and fee cuts, further reduction of financial institutions' cash reserves and a strong wave of infrastructure investment will support the economic recovery, and finally achieve the annual target of between 6 to 6.5 percent growth, said Zhang Ping, deputy head of the National Institution for Finance and Development under the CASS.\nThe research evaluated the government's macroeconomic policy package for 2019 as \"balanced\", without large expansion of fiscal deficit and the overall debt growth target as \"moderate\".\nFiscal policy adjustments, led by the value-added tax cuts from Monday, may lift the annual GDP by 0.3 to 0.4 percentage point. The monetary policy, which still has room to ease, especially from further cuts in the reserve requirement ratio, will play a key role to offset potential deflation risks in the manufacturing sector, according to Zhang.\nInvestors are speculating that the central bank will launch another RRR cut, as early as the first half of April, given the still-tight liquidity in financial markets and a potential increase of interest rates. The central bank has cut the RRR five times since last year.\nMeanwhile, a contraction was seen in the prices of industrial products during the first two months of this year, as the Producer Price Index (PPI) dropped to 0.1 percent by the end of February from 0.9 percent in December, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics.\nThe CASS research report said further attention is necessary to tame deflation risks, especially those from the industrial sector, because further weakening of the PPI may lead to a fall in the return on capital of companies, reduce asset values and increase debt pressure. Hence, banks may become more cautious in lending money to companies, and increase interest rates.\nLi Yang, head of the National Institution for Finance and Development, said that the fiscal policy and the monetary policy should strengthen connection and coordination, to support the development of \"real economy\".\n\"The original reason for financial risks is high leveraging, which requires deleveraging to be a long-term task,\" said Li.\nHe also said that one of the key jobs for financial regulators is to build a comprehensive supervision system, both online and offline, to tighten controls on capital flows, both internally and across the border.\nBesides, market-oriented pricing systems for treasury bond yields, interest rates, and foreign exchange rates will make steady progress this year.\nTo improve investment efficiency, Lian Ping, chief economist at Bank of Communications, suggested channeling of more funds from the banking sector to the stock market.
