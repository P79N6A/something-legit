After a lengthy pause, we\u2019re very pleased to be back with a new episode. Today, Nick Leung chats with Jonathan Woetzel and Gordon Orr about the state of the Chinese economy. GDP growth is cooling while a trade war heats up with the US. How are these and other trends impacting consumption and investment? And what kind of opportunities are these creating for companies in China today? Jonathan Woetzel is a senior partner who leads the McKinsey Global Institute [MGI] in Asia. Gordon Orr is a former Asia chairman at McKinsey and now is a senior adviser to the firm. Nick Leung is chairman of McKinsey\u2019s Greater China practice.\nNick Leung: Hello, welcome back to McKinsey on China . After our sabbatical from podcasting, we are back with our regular gurus: Gordon Orr, former Asia chairman and senior adviser to the firm; Jonathan Woetzel, the head of our McKinsey Global Institute; and me, Nick Leung. By popular demand, we are back on the podcasting trail and we hope to give you a few things to listen to in the course of the rest of 2019\u2014which is going to be a big year. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here to talk about today.\nToday\u2019s question is: What is the current state of China\u2019s economy? We\u2019ll try and break this up into, first, a conversation of how we got here, and also what we think might happen next. Of course, having Gordon here, we have the bravest man in terms of China prediction. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all read his predictions for 2019. We\u2019ll cover those in passing, but that won\u2019t be the main topic of today. We\u2019re going to first talk about how we got here.\nJonathan, why don\u2019t you kick us off with the McKinsey Global Institute version of how we got here? Then Gordon and I will ask tough questions.\nJonathan Woetzel: Sure, Nick, and great to be back. So, a little bit depends on where we want to start this, because at some level we can start it way back when in terms of opening up China\u2019s economy and market reforms and all that, which sometimes people forget that this is still, relatively speaking, a new thing\u2014an experiment that may not have been written about in books before, it certainly has been written about now, but still as an experiment. There\u2019s a lot of innovation, and there\u2019s a lot of trying it and seeing whether it works.\nBut in that context, I think we could start it maybe back in 2008, during a great financial recession. So that had an impact on China and notably it kicked off a round of stimulus that went for about seven or eight years. It also included, from 2008 to 2015 or 2016, a whole set of financial reform and liberalization, including the growth of shadow banking and informal lending and a lot of experiments on the debt side as well.\nAll of which resulted in nominal credit growth, so double-digit rates, sometimes up to 20 percent.\nHowever, by the late teens, this was starting to show that although there was still a lot of credit going on, there were also signs of a quite significant bubble in as much as the nominal GDP growth was no longer responding in the double-digit ways that it had prior to this. On the other hand, real-estate prices were [responding]. So reading these not-so-subtle tea leaves, regulators, as of 2016, essentially called to halt the financial reforms that resulted in quite a significant drop for the last 24 months in credit availability. So we\u2019ve had a big downturn in credit.\nIt takes a lot to stop the Chinese economy, but eventually you get there. We see results of that credit squeeze particularly in the private sector, particularly in smaller enterprises, and particularly in tier-three or tier-four cities now resulting in a slowdown in consumption and a slowdown in growth overall. The economy\u2019s largely increasingly dependent on consumption and increasingly on services. So eventually that credit squeeze fed through to the private sector, to employment, to income, and to consumption. That has been the story for past six months, the impact of that tightening and what to do about it.\nSo we\u2019re in a moment where the government is essentially saying, \u201cWell, OK. Maybe we\u2019re getting into a cycle. There\u2019s a downturn. How does one come out of this again?\u201d Now we have to talk about opening up credit again, but maybe not in such an open-ended way as what was happening in the late teens. For example, the PBOC [People\u2019s Bank of China] has recently come out in support of bank liquidity through perpetual issuance, which is intended to allow banks to issue these bonds, to recapitalize and, as a result, lend more, but only under the conditions that the target of lending achieves certain minimum credit standards.\nNick Leung: Jonathan, let me stop you before you shortcut to the forward-looking picture and just reiterate what you said about what you called eight plus two, which is eight years of stimulus followed by two years of attempted deleveraging. Of course, we\u2019ve seen that in the P2P [peer-to-peer] lending platforms and reductions in shadow banking, et cetera, so the financial markets have certainly played out the way you said.\nThe fundamental question though, which you just passed over, which was that actually the problem with the stimulus was partly the asset bubbles, also partly that it wasn\u2019t delivering the results that it had in the past, right? So each dollar of stimulus was delivering less in actual GDP growth and just more in some of these externalities around asset bubbles, et cetera, right?\nJonathan Woetzel: I think that\u2019s fair. The ICOR, or the incremental capital-output ratio\u2014in other words, the amount of bucks that you have to put in to get a certain amount of bang\u2014has been going up quite a lot. To quote one very senior Chinese finance official, essentially, this is because everything is more expensive. Plus, you don\u2019t have as much low-hanging fruit. Back in the day, when we first started off the investment, we were sort of urbanizing Shanghai and Beijing. Now you\u2019re urbanizing Guangzhou. It\u2019s just not the same.\nNick Leung: So basically, like everything else, it got more expensive. Stimulus became more expensive.\nGordon Orr: Let me stand up for Guangzhou. There are many leading-edge data centers and the like transforming the economy down there. But I think what you\u2019re both getting at is the problem with any stimulus\u2014is ending a stimulus, all stimuluses have to end at some point in time. There\u2019s pain that\u2019s associated with it, and there\u2019s different ways of exiting. In the China way of exiting, pulling back particularly the informal credit channels into the economy, whether it\u2019s the shadow banking, peer-to-peer lending, or the like, has really dented not just the confidence, but the ability to operate for some types of players.\nMidsize industrial companies got very excited about where their share price had gotten to, and then the owner pledged their shares, went off, and invested that money in new ventures that may pay off at some point in the future but haven\u2019t yet; their share price has gone down by half. The banks are saying, \u201cCome on guys, we need some security here.\u201d They\u2019re in deep trouble.\nNick Leung: That\u2019s absolutely one of the things we see, but that\u2019s again looking forward.\nOne of the things I just want to make sure, before we get to the look-forward picture, Gordon, is also to slay one particular falsehood, or fake news perhaps is a better phrase for it, which is that this is all driven by the Trump trade war. That somehow the correlation between the tariff threats has something to do with the slowdown in China. Of course, this has been much trumpeted across the world, and we don\u2019t see it like that.\nGordon Orr: The vast majority of China\u2019s economic growth is driven domestically, and driven by growth in consumption of services, driven by growth in expenditures by consumers. Slowdown in the economy, still, by the way, adding absolute economic growth of something like the size of the Australian economy every year, but the slowdown to the current levels is being driven by slower growth in consumer expenditures.\nNick Leung: So the trade dependency of China on US actual trade, what we have now in the tariff regime, is less than 1 percent of GDP. So it can\u2019t be that the threat of 1 percent of GDP is driving consumer sentiment in third-tier cities and forcing people not to buy cars. It may be a small influencing factor, but there\u2019s clearly a bigger thing going on here in China.\nGordon Orr: It can be an influencing factor, as you say. It\u2019s an input to consumer confidence. It\u2019s potentially an input to private-sector investment if companies are holding off on making investment decisions on more manufacturing capacity. But as I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get to in a subsequent podcast, the multidimensional nature of the relationship between the US and China goes way beyond trade. I think we\u2019re going to get into that; we should talk about it much more in totality.\nNick Leung: Yes. OK, so let\u2019s move on quickly.\nSo in the middle of last year, we saw this quite abrupt, in some cases, dip in consumer spending in some categories, be it cars, a real slowdown in things like cosmetics, so discretionary spending, particularly for large-ticket items. That slowdown continued for the last half of last year, and then there was a much trumpeted lowest-growth quarter in 20 years.\nGordon Orr: But, Nick, if I could, I think this isn\u2019t a situation where\u2014I\u2019ll pass it over to Jonathan in a second\u2014because you have to focus on the aggregate, not the specific. Yes, there are specific companies that made an enormous deal about how their sales in China were declining, whether it\u2019s Apple or Jaguar Land Rover, or a host of other companies that have said specifically, \u201cWe didn\u2019t hit our global numbers because of China.\u201d Then there\u2019s the counterpoints of other companies that have absolutely said, \u201cWe\u2019ve exceeded our goals in China, and we\u2019ve been going strong.\u201d China Brief: The state of the economy Read the article\nI think there\u2019s a tendency to amplify the bad news on specific companies that actually may have made the wrong product choices and made the wrong channel choices and saw the implications of that in China. Whereas, in aggregate, consumer spending, while it didn\u2019t rise in double digits last year, still had 8 percent, 9 percent growth in consumption.\nJonathan, I think with MGI you\u2019ve got a much better handle on the aggregate data, so maybe I\u2019ll hand it over to you.\nJonathan Woetzel: I think that Gordon is absolutely right, of course, and I agree with him here that in the aggregate, China is still the world\u2019s best consumer story. I think that what\u2019s changing a little bit is the nature of that story, and that in the early days this was a very luxury market. The early sort of growth in the premium market was truly astounding. Now it\u2019s becoming much more of a middle mass market.\nAs we cross that line into hundreds of millions of people in the urban middle class moving into their own, it\u2019s a very cost-competitive market now. They still want the premium, especially for a global product or a global brand, and there\u2019s so much more competition right now. I think that\u2019s where some of the foreign companies might\u2019ve been caught out a little bit, because of the pace, speed, and the catch-up of local competitors, coupled with that increase of mass-market flavor to it.\nNick Leung: My understanding is that we are still in the premiumization trend, so we continue to see that, we continue to see overall growth across the board. So it\u2019s just that growth has slowed, but it\u2019s growing. You are, however, seeing some very interesting things, like, for example, a segment of trading down consumers.\nThere was lots of publicity about Pinduoduo last year, the new internet attacker that actually managed to put a dent into the e-commerce duopoly that we have already in China, through essentially a value proposition, which was specifically targeted at people wanting to trade down for more cost-effective purchases. That\u2019s actually quite interesting in China. So I think what we\u2019re probably seeing is just China\u2019s becoming a bit more like the rest of the world in terms of the heterogeneity of consumer choices and consumer incomes, which is natural.\nI think this would form a great topic for a future podcast, so let\u2019s not go too far down to the consumer because there\u2019s a lot going on with the consumer right now, and absolutely we should spend a good segment on that.\nBut perhaps having now painted what we think the picture is, in terms of the coincidence, not necessarily a direct causation between some of the trade disputes with the rest of the world, and also the overall economy. Big companies, private companies out there feeling the credit squeeze, as you said, Gordon. We are seeing some companies announcing job cuts. Obviously, employment uncertainty in China translates quite quickly into consumer sentiment, but then of course on the other hand, employment can be stimulated through other means, and the government has those means. So how do we see the go-forward picture here? Do we see continued tightening?\nMy sense is that we are at quite an interesting position now. We\u2019re just before the next round of tariffs, potentially, in a couple of weeks. We have begun to see some of the effects of the credit crunch on some of the private companies. So probably the next six months or so will be an interesting indicator of where we are in this particular story. Jonathan, what do you think?\nJonathan Woetzel: I think, again, it takes a lot to do anything to the Chinese economy, to guide it, to super tank [it], or it\u2019s moving at speed. So even if you started the stimulus or restimulus measures now, six, 12 months before you get to see something tangible in terms of the uplift in consumption and income beyond trend line. I\u2019d expect that it\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better. This will primarily be visible in the private sector, and sectors that have overcapacity, and where you will see consolidation. Going into a little bit of a question about who consolidates whom, but real estate would be an example, and I\u2019m sure that there will be industrial sectors that likewise format a basis for consolidation. That has knock-on effects. Notably local ones, because industry tends to be very spatially concentrated. So that means that we\u2019ll probably see some regional bailouts. Then I think what is a little bit the purpose of starting to recapitalize the banks, and to give them options to increase their lending, so that when the inevitable happens they can step in and pick up the pieces. How they pick up the pieces and who ultimately winds up with those pieces is a very interesting question.\nGordon Orr: I\u2019d be prepared to look forward and say with this credit pressure, particularly on midsize private-sector companies, yes, there will be a considerable round of consolidation. It\u2019s quite an interesting window of opportunity for multinationals if you want to be bold in this space, because clearly there\u2019s an intent to show increased openness to foreign direct investment in quite a number of sectors.\nNick Leung: So are you leaning forward also on your prediction of the trade resolution in the next two weeks?\nGordon Orr: Let me continue on the thought that I was making, that there\u2019s a real window for multinationals that have scale and significance in their sectors in China today to see some of their local competition that\u2019s been really aggressive and quite successful over the past few years but now balance-sheet stressed to potentially take them over or to take over a significant chunk of the business. Industrial services may be slightly less in real estate, which is a more complex, local-for-local business going forward.\nNick Leung: But also consumer.\nGordon Orr: But the consumer\u2019s going to be benefiting, and we can debate how large the impact is going to be from the income-tax cuts, the subsidies to purchase white goods, potentially the subsidies to purchase cars coming back again. To Jonathan\u2019s point, those have been playing through for six to nine months now. If they\u2019re going to have an impact, we should be starting to see that going forward.\nNick Leung: So that would argue, Gordon, if I can put a nail on your prediction there, a relatively short cycle is what you see? Apart from the opportunity point, which of course that\u2019s very interesting, but in terms of the cycle you probably see something which is not too deep a trough.\nGordon Orr: I certainly don\u2019t see anything cataclysmic here, and that the pushes into the banking sector to start to re-extend more credit in a directed fashion to increase spending on infrastructure, things that have already been done on consumer, yes, will see a relatively near-term turning point in the economy.\nNick Leung: Infrastructure, for example, infrastructure went from almost 20 percent down to 4 percent between 2017 and 2018. So obviously that\u2019s a bit of a lead indicator, but yes, we\u2019re seeing essentially the impact of those types of shifts in investments and credit that you mentioned.\nJonathan Woetzel: I\u2019d add that the single biggest swing factor in the economy, real estate, which is of course way over where it needs to be or should be in the Chinese economy. But because of the unavailability of other savings vehicles, that\u2019s what you get, is a lot of middle-class income goes into real-estate purchases, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ll see the bulk of the impact in terms of swings and roundabouts going forward. So the government has an interest in trying to maintain some level stability, but not overdoing it so that now we have clearly got a rental crisis and a housing crisis in major cities. So it\u2019s not having enough space for people to live.\nSo this time around might be a little different. I see that there\u2019s some desire for the government to essentially keep some of that pressure on, so that we don\u2019t see overexuberant marketplaces in the very short term. To keep things a little bit tight so that we don\u2019t see a kickoff of another speculative spiral again.\nNick Leung: So you\u2019ve taken the point that I was going to make, which was that I am actually much less positive than you guys for two reasons. First of all, because some of the employment data I think is quite worrying. I see the consumer slowdown essentially being employment linked, and people worried about their employment status. Of course, everyone will end up doing something, but the question is what they do.\nAs Gordon has pointed out on other occasions, there is an oversupply of tier-one labor and of graduate labor. At least, we\u2019re getting to that point, even though the overall labor force isn\u2019t increasing. So I think there is a labor issue here, and unemployment may play out.\nI also think that if you look at the pattern of this particular administration, it has not prioritized economic growth. I mean, apart from the reaction obviously to the global financial crisis, which was very swift and very significant, but if you look generally, their priorities seem to be more political and geopolitical than economic. So I\u2019m not convinced that they\u2019re going to sail to the rescue and make it a short cycle, and I think we might see something a little longer.\nGordon Orr: To be continued. Nick will be buying us dinner when he\u2019s wrong.\nNick Leung: Indeed, which will be, Gordon, according to your view, by the end of the year; we\u2019ll see things coming back.\nGordon Orr: I\u2019m looking forward to a fine Christmas dinner, thanks.

The volume increase in coal production during the referred period has been a robust 39.5 MT against previous year's production of 567.37 MT,\u201d the company said in a statement. Coal India said it scaled a new peak in monthly production in March 2019 producing 79.19 MT - the highest so far in a month since inception. The company clocked highest ever production of 3.14 MT in a single day on 25 March.Coal supplies to the consuming sectors touched a new high at 608 MT during 2018-19 as against a MoU target of 610 MT. The increase in absolute figures was 28 MT compared to last year\u2019s off-take of 580.29 MT registering a growth of 4.8 per cent. CIL recorded the highest ever despatch of 2.24 MT in a single day on the last day of the fiscal 2019.Coal supply to the thermal power sector by CIL sources stood at 488 MT as against 454 MTs supplied last fiscal (2017-18).

With that being the case, I continue to buy this market on short-term pullbacks as the level has been so reliable and is visible on even the monthly time frames.

That doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t eventually break out, I do believe we will give enough time. However, the attitude of the market is very much one of a \u201cbuy on the dips\u201d situation. However, beyond that we have massive resistance above in the form of the 200 day EMA, which currently sits at about the 0.72 level. Remember, this pair is essentially waiting on the results of the US/China trade relations, which of course are still in the back and forth situation, so I think at this point we are simply churning trying to figure out where we are going longer-term. For my money, this looks a lot like a bottoming process, which of course can take quite some time.

The pair was found to recover previous losses under the light of upbeat Chinese data released during the Asian session easing economic sluggishness in China. This easiness in the economy helped the Crude Oil prices to reach new heights. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was trading at $60.80 per barrel, 1.15 percent up for the day.\nThe Commodity-linked currency \u2013 Canadian dollars also benefited from the oil price surge. The loonie pair, however, was seen to remain range bound during the day. The pair had sustained between the resistance level of 1.3370 and 1.3341 support level.

His view may help the market participants to predict the possible interest-rate movements. Canada has joined the US with regards to having an Inverted Yield Curve on 21 March. The difference between the short term yields and the yields on long term bonds becoming negative, posses the threat of possible economic recession.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to be talking about cutting rates at this juncture,\u201d said Doug Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal.

The pair seems to be trading in the narrow range with support level as 1.3399 and resistance as 1.3370. The USD/CAD pair which saw a sudden fall in the Friday\u2019s mid-session has not recovered/ extended in the market session. At around 13:25 GMT, the pair failed to break the major support level of 1.3339. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) confirms the lost momentum and the direction in the USD/CAD pair.

The US dollar index had plunged from its last week high levels reaching 97.10 level. This fall helped the GBP/USD pair to soar during the Asian session. The pair jumped from 1.3016 touching 1.3097 level on the USD Index pain.\nTrump\u2019s statement on Sunday warned that he might close the border with Mexico on the top of dreads out of domestic political tensions.

But if MPs succeeded in voting on alternative ways, then Theresa May could have to renegotiate, and she may call for General Election or Second Referendum as a possible outcome.\nAny positive signal that indicates a deal Brexit would help the Sterling Pound to ascend and recover its incurred losses.\nTechnical Analysis GBPUSD 5 Min 1 April 2019 More The Cable followed a seamless uptrend in the morning session hitting the last day\u2019s resistance level of 1.3124. The pair is heading to touch the next 1.3135 resistance level.

With that in mind, I believe that this market is going to continue to go back and forth and look for some type of opportunity. At this point, I look at the \u00a5110 level as the \u201cbottom\u201d of the range, just as I see the \u00a5111.50 level above offers significant resistance.

Once we do break down, then we can start putting more money to work for a bigger position. At this point, I suspect this is probably one of the least favorable markets to be involved in, and therefore I\u2019m simply waiting for some type of clarity. It may be a while, because this pair tends to move right along with the stock markets and the risk appetite around the world, so with all of the moving pieces geopolitically and of course with other situations such as the trade negotiations between the United States and China.

Better-than-expected Chinese Manufacturing PMI dampened fears of a global economic slowdown. This also helped reduce the U.S. Dollar\u2019s appeal as a safe-haven asset, encouraging traders to sell the greenback and buy the Euro. Traders also feel the news from China may lead to economic improvements in the Euro Zone. Furthermore, we could be looking at position-squaring ahead of a slew of U.S. economic data this week, including U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls on Friday.\nAt 12:19 GMT, the EUR/USD is trading 1.1234, up 0.0016 or +0.15%.\nDaily EUR/USD More Daily Technical Analysis The main trend is up according to the daily swing chart, but momentum has been trending lower since the week-ending March 22. A trade through 1.1177 will change the main trend to down. A move through 1.1448 will signal a resumption of the uptrend.\nThe minor trend is down. This supports the downside shift in momentum. A new minor bottom has formed at 1.1201. A trade through this level will reaffirm the minor downtrend.\nThe next support target is a major, long-term Fibonacci level at 1.1185.\nThe main range is 1.1177 to 1.1448. Its retracement zone at 1.1281 to 1.1313 is resistance.\nDaily Technical Forecast Based on the early price action, the direction of the EUR/USD on Monday is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the uptrending Gann angle at 1.1220.\nBullish Scenario A sustained move over 1.1220 will indicate the presence of buyers. If this creates enough upside momentum then look for a rally to possibly extend into the next uptrending Gann angle at 1.1262. Overtaking this angle could drive the EUR/USD into a Fibonacci level at 1.1281, followed closely by a downtrending Gann angle at 1.1288.\nBearish Scenario A sustained move under 1.1220 will signal the presence of sellers. Taking out 1.1201 will indicate the selling is getting stronger with the next downside targets the Fib level at 1.1185, followed by the main bottom at 1.1177. This is the potential trigger point for an acceleration into 1.1118, the June 20, 2017 main bottom.\nThe U.S. Retail Sales data was mixed so we saw no reaction by the Euro.

After all, we still have plenty of headlines out there when it comes to the Brexit, which continue to be very difficult to follow.\nGBP/USD Video 02.04.19 All that being said, it looks as if the 1.30 level is a crucial support level, and the recent action has certainly panned out that way. The 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level since there, and of course we have seen a couple of bounces. However, to the upside we see a lot of resistance at the 1.3350 level, which of course being broken to the upside could open the doors to the 1.35 handle rather quickly, perhaps even changing the overall trend even further than we have seen as of late. Remember, we broke above a major downtrend line, bounced off of it, and have been consolidating since that move.\nWith all that being said, I think that the British pound is in the process of finding its legs for a longer-term move to the upside. These are always messy and noisy affairs, and difficult to trade. Because of this, it will take a certain amount of patience and a whole lot of belief. If we do break down below the 1.30 level, then the market will probably look to \u201creset\u201d down at the 1.28 level underneath.\nPlease let us know what you think in the comments below\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\nMore From FXEMPIRE: USD/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 US dollar chops on Monday against yen EUR/USD Price Forecast \u2013 Euro bounces for major support level NZD/USD is Bearish as Long as Two POC Zones Hold The Resistance GBP/USD Price Forecast \u2013 British pound shoot higher to kick off week Natural Gas Price Forecast \u2013 Natural gas markets rally to kick off week Gold Price Prediction \u2013 Prices Move Sideways on Mixed Data", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/_pulRRjIU9Q?feature=oembed", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/gold-price-prediction-prices-move-sideways-on-mixed-data-565645", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/gbp-usd-price-forecast-british-pound-shoot-higher-to-kick-off-week-565599&quot;", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/nzd-usd-is-bearish-as-long-as-two-poc-zones-hold-the-resistance-565585", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/usd-jpy-price-forecast-us-dollar-chops-on-monday-against-yen-565602", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/gbp-usd/overview", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/natural-gas-price-forecast-natural-gas-markets-rally-to-kick-off-week-565608", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/eur-usd-price-forecast-euro-bounces-for-major-support-level-565593", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/gbp-usd/overview&quot;", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/gbp-usd-price-forecast-british-pound-shoot-higher-to-kick-off-week-565599"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T09:57:59.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "22730622da38c3028edd17f6601bd1fbb3276ee7", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eur-usd-price-forecast-euro-162903222.html", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://finance.yahoo.com/currency-converter", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo Finance - Business Finance, Stock Market, Quotes, News", "title": "EUR/USD Price Forecast \u2013 Euro bounces for major support level", "title_full": "EUR/USD Price Forecast \u2013 Euro bounces for major support level", "published": "2019-04-02T00:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.773, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rdEy6higtytG7dGUpxwUCQ--~B/aD00MjE7dz02MzA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/fx_empire_176/e98fbdc8dd471b72d571e965b2d447ea", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "22730622da38c3028edd17f6601bd1fbb3276ee7", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eur-usd-price-forecast-euro-162903222.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FX Empire", "published": "2019-04-02T00:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "EUR/USD Price Forecast \u2013 Euro bounces for major support level", "text": "The Euro found the 1.12 level to be massive support yet again, as we bounced during early trading on Monday. The market of course is going to struggle as there are a lot of problems in the European Union currently, but the reality is that economic numbers on the United States are slowing down as well, so it\u2019s difficult to imagine a situation where there will be enough excitement to send the US dollar into a frenzy. Quite frankly, we are getting to the point where we are starting to see significant concerns with both economies, and therefore it\u2019s very likely that we will stay within the range that we have carved out as of late.\nEUR USD Forecast Video 02.04.19 While the 1.12 level underneath is massive support, you have to keep in mind that the 1.15 level above is massive resistance. With that being the situation we find ourselves in, and the fact that we are so significantly obvious as far as our range, so at this point I\u2019m a buyer here and then I would take profit somewhere closer to the 1.1450 level which is the beginning of massive resistance. Looking at this chart, there is most certainly more risk to the upside then down.\nHowever, if we did break down below the area around the 1.12 level, the market could very well find itself into a freefall down to the 1.10 level. However, so far it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s a serious threat, so it\u2019s likely this bounce should lead to a longer-term trade to the upside.\nPlease let us know what you think in the comments below\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\nMore From FXEMPIRE: GBP/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 British pound rallies to kick off the week USD/CAD Daily Price Forecast \u2013 Canadian Loonie Holds Fort On Weak Crude Oil Silver Price Forecast \u2013 Silver markets looking for a floored Gold Price Forecast \u2013 Gold markets looking for buyers E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM) Futures Technical Analysis \u2013 Needs to Hold 26145 to Sustain Rally Natural Gas Price Prediction \u2013 Prices Rebound but Remain Rangebound", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/natural-gas-price-prediction-prices-rebound-but-remain-rangebound-2-565648", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/usd-cad-daily-price-forecast-canadian-loonie-holds-fort-on-weak-crude-oil-565644", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/gold-price-forecast-gold-markets-looking-for-buyers-565605", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/e-mini-dow-jones-industrial-average-ym-futures-technical-analysis-needs-to-hold-26145-to-sustain-rally-565535", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/eur-usd/overview&quot;", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/gUJJiqzF3BY?feature=oembed", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/silver-price-forecast-silver-markets-looking-for-a-floored-565614", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/eur-usd/overview", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/eur-usd-price-forecast-euro-bounces-for-major-support-level-565593", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/eur-usd-price-forecast-euro-bounces-for-major-support-level-565593&quot;", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/gbp-jpy-price-forecast-british-pound-rallies-to-kick-off-the-week-565596"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T09:58:56.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ad7dda7b4896b5411159151c38a2619a9737ae07", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nzd-usd-bearish-long-two-162008315.html", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://finance.yahoo.com/currency-converter", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo Finance - Business Finance, Stock Market, Quotes, News", "title": "NZD/USD is Bearish as Long as Two POC Zones Hold The Resistance", "title_full": "NZD/USD is Bearish as Long as Two POC Zones Hold The Resistance", "published": "2019-04-02T00:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.484, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9JZKwzCbfSjGuy_OiuhhlA--~B/aD00MTc7dz02MzA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/fx_empire_176/da52ac98cab8b95b634091e0407a103f", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ad7dda7b4896b5411159151c38a2619a9737ae07", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nzd-usd-bearish-long-two-162008315.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FX Empire", "published": "2019-04-02T00:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "NZD/USD is Bearish as Long as Two POC Zones Hold The Resistance", "text": "Dear Traders,\nThe NZD/USD is still in downtrend.

(GAC Group) saw its total revenue in 2018 grow 7.04 percent year on year to about 363.7 billion yuan (54.2 billion U.S. dollars).\nAccording to its annual report released Monday, the group bucked the industry trend with production and sales up 8.77 percent and 7.34 percent respectively, as China's domestic automobile industry faced negative growth for the first time in 28 years, according to the report.\nIn 2018, the group's annual auto production and sales were 2.19 million and 2.15 million respectively. The sales growth was about 10 percentage points higher than the industry average, and its market share increased to about 7.65 percent.\n\"The sales of our own brand vehicles have exceeded 500,000 for two consecutive years,\" said Zeng Qinghong, chairman of GAC Group, adding that the group's joint venture brands have also maintained steady and fast growth.

The S&P 500 ended the day just above the flatline at 2,867.24, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.25 percent to close at 7,848.69.\nConsumer staples and energy were the worst-performing sectors in the S&P 500, sliding 0.8 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. Real estate outperformed, rising 0.9 percent, while materials climbed 0.4 percent.\n\"Today looks like consolidation,\" said Larry Benedict, founder of The Opportunistic Trader . But \"we've definitely broken out of that range around 2,800; we're now around 2,870. We could go to the high\" seen last year.\nBenedict added the March jobs report \u2014 which is scheduled for release Friday morning \u2014 could be the catalyst for stocks to reach record highs. \"These numbers on Friday are really much more important to what's going to happen in the next move from here.\"\nThe moves Tuesday come after strong manufacturing data out of the U.S. and China raised sentiment during Monday's session , with the Dow closing above 26,000 points for the first time since Feb. 26. The 30-stock index also gained more than 300 points on Monday, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both rallied more than 1 percent. Christopher Lee | Bloomberg | Getty Images A customer views merchandise for sale at a Walgreens store in the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles.\nU.S. manufacturing activity expanded last month, data showed, rebounding from its lowest level since late 2016. A separate survey showed China's factory activity also rebounded, expanding at its fastest pace in eight months.\nThe data sent Treasury yields surging on Monday, which in turn lifted bank stocks. Rates were down slightly on Tuesday, as the benchmark 10-year yield traded at 2.47 percent.\nData released Tuesday showed capital goods orders fell 0.1 percent in February, while economists polled by Refinitiv expected an unchanged print.\nMonday's gains added to a strong start to 2019 for stocks as the S&P 500 trades more than 13 percent higher for 2019. However, gains will be harder to come by moving forward, according to Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock.\n\"We see a repeat as unlikely and a narrower path for a grind higher,\" Turnill said in a note. \"The global economy must remain strong enough to quell recession fears but weak enough to keep policymakers on hold, we believe.\"\n\"We see further decelerations in both economic and earnings growth ahead, with pressure on historically high corporate profit margins,\" Turnill added. \"Yet we are also increasingly confident that the global economy can remain in late-cycle throughout 2019.\"\nShares of the Dow member Walgreens Boots Alliance fell 12.8 percent on weaker-than-expected earnings. Walgreens also lowered its earnings forecast for 2019 . Tuesday's session was the stock's worst since Aug. 6, 2014, when it fell 14.3 percent.\nDelta Air Lines, meanwhile, rose 6 percent after the company hiked its earnings guidance for the first quarter. Delta cited healthy demand.\nWalgreens' and Delta's releases come ahead of what Wall Street expects to be a tough earnings season. First-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to have fallen nearly 4 percent from the year-earlier period, according to FactSet.\n\"We had five straight quarters of double-digit growth and now the expectations are for a slight move backwards,\" said Craig Birk, chief investment officer at Personal Capital. \"It will be interesting see how people deal with that after becoming really used to strong growth.\"\n\u2014CNBC's Ryan Browne contributed to this report.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ryan browne", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "walgreens boots alliance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T10:19:57.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9f3d5b75236dae1a2b07876c3aca8e4733ae1552", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/04/01/no-government-no-problem-economy-will-fine-without-one/", "site_full": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "site": "telegraph.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/opinion/", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "Business opinion: Columns &amp; analysis", "title": "No government, no problem - why the economy will be fine without one", "title_full": "No government, no problem - why the economy will be fine without one", "published": "2019-04-01T19:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2019/04/01/TELEMMGLPICT000193020970-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 317, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9f3d5b75236dae1a2b07876c3aca8e4733ae1552", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/04/01/no-government-no-problem-economy-will-fine-without-one/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Matthew Lynn", "published": "2019-04-01T19:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "No government, no problem - why the economy will be fine without one", "text": "E mployment is rising.

They also blamed the rise on the difficulty in prosecuting, or expelling where applicable, the foreign, underage thieves they do catch.\nThe situation has got so bad that metro drivers now regularly make announcements to passengers when they detect gangs of pickpockets entering a train, telling them to hold tight to their belongings.\nAccording to police cited by Le Parisien, gangs of mainly young girls, numbering between five to ten, pounce on a carriage when they spot unsuspecting tourists.\nLocals are wise to their methods and simply leave a carriage when they arrive or stick to the walls. \u201cTourists come all the time but are loathe to file a legal complaint because they don\u2019t want to waste time,\u201d one public transport employee told the paper.\n\u201cWe phone the police to come and intervene but as the thieves know perfectly their rights, they say they are minors and they are let go within 15 minutes.\u201d\nThe number of thefts on Paris public transported has shot up 33 per cent this year, say police Credit: IAN LANGSDON/EPA O ne police chief told La Parisien that the rise was down to the \u201cgilet jaunes\u201d, who have been causing havoc in central Paris every Saturday for months.\n\u201cThe teams have been mobilised every Saturday during the yellow vest demos so couldn\u2019t deal with anything else,\u201d he said.\nS ome 56 per cent of suspected pickpockets arrested in Paris public transport are minors, he said, adding that the possibility of pressing charges were \u201climited\u201d. Some 90 per cent are from Eastern Europe or North Africa (Algeria, Morocco or Tunisia).\nThe police chief warned against taking them on as \u201csome don\u2019t hesitate to use knives or gas\u201d.\nThe rise comes despite attempts to warn tourists via multi-lingual brochures and introducing a simplified way of filing a legal complain in stations for insurance purposes. Paris police has also this year put in place a special \u201ctourist plan\u201d designed to safeguard metro stations.\nThere have been a number of high-profile court cases of pickpocket rings in recent years, notably of a notorious gang masquerading as tourists at the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre and Versailles , who made an estimated \u20ac700,000 and wired the money back to Romania.\nIn an editorial, Le Parisien warned that turning a blind eye to the fact that most of the thieves were Eastern Europe would only play into the hands of the far-Right.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "le parisien", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T11:13:46.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6b7f03b324177fab1c9094e5c618d9ba3bb79469", "url": "https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/litecoin-market-update-ltc-usd-goes-ballistic-smashes-above-weekly-sma200-201904020832", "site_full": "www.fxstreet.com", "site": "fxstreet.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "", "title": "Litecoin market update: LTC/USD goes ballistic, smashes above weekly SMA200", "title_full": "Litecoin market update: LTC/USD goes ballistic, smashes above weekly SMA200", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.022, "main_image": "https://editorial.azureedge.net/images/Markets/Currencies/Digital Currencies/Litecoin/Litecoin_2_Large.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9758, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6b7f03b324177fab1c9094e5c618d9ba3bb79469", "url": "https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/litecoin-market-update-ltc-usd-goes-ballistic-smashes-above-weekly-sma200-201904020832", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Litecoin market update: LTC/USD goes ballistic, smashes above weekly SMA200", "text": "LTC/USD has grown by 10% since the beginning of Tuesday.

In the Government Work Report delivered on March 5 to the National People's Congress, the country's top legislature, Premier Li Keqiang set a target range of 6 to 6.5 percent to be achieved this year.\nRoach said, \"The low point could be the first quarter this year, but I expect a slight improvement in the second quarter, and by the third quarter the economy will be on target.\"\nAndrew Sheng, distinguished fellow at the Asia Global Institute at the University of Hong Kong, believes the increase in consumer confidence in China in January will herald a recovery in growth.\n\"You could see a very big revival in consumption in January. This was partly related to the stock market revival. Although there was pessimism at the end of last year, it is important never to underestimate the resilience of the Chinese economy,\" said Sheng.\nDavid Rubenstein, co-founder and co-executive chairman of US global investment company The Carlyle Group, was bullish about the China economy.\n\"The economy is in pretty good shape, and I believe a trade agreement would propel it forward. We would love to have this type of growth in the US,\" said Rubenstein, who, like Roach and Sheng, spoke to China Daily during the recent China Development Forum in Beijing.\nHowever, the global outlook remains uncertain with the US economy slowing down, Europe sluggish and issues such as US-China trade conflict and the prospect of Brexit adding to worries.\n\"Everywhere you turn there is uncertainty,\" said Michael Spence, professor of economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University and a Nobel Prize winner for economics.\n\"A global recession is still not, in my view, the most likely scenario, although it wouldn't take a huge shock to take us over the edge.\"\nRoach, a longtime observer of the China economy, was also concerned about the overall global position.\n\"The US economy has gone from 4 percent (GDP growth) in the second quarter of last year to 3 percent in the third, 2 percent in the fourth and now it looks like 1 percent in the first quarter of this year,\" he said.\n\"The global outlook is also tough. Europe is weak and so is Japan, which could be lapsing back into another recession, and who knows about Brexit? What is disconcerting is that it comes at a time when there is very little space for central banks or fiscal authorities to ease policy aggressively.\"\nCharles-Edouard Bouee, CEO of management consultants Roland Berger, said increasing inequality in the West was also worrisome.\nBouee said the lack of a resolution over Brexit was not helping, with the prospect of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal not ruled out.\n\"It is like someone saying he is going to die tomorrow but he is still around. We don't know if he is going to die and the doctor doesn't know whether he is really sick,\" he said.\nOne of the major concerns remains the lack of productivity growth since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago, which is constraining any improvement of living standards globally and leading to political disquiet.\nRubenstein said China is making progress in upgrading its economy, which should deliver greater productivity for its economy in the longer term.\n\"Nothing works overnight, but I think China is doing a very good job of focusing industries they want to be leaders in, artificial intelligence being one and robotics another,\" he said.\nLawrence Summers, a former US Treasury Secretary, reflected on China's economic success at an event in Beijing.\nHe said China's economic transformation in recent years was even more dramatic than Britain's Industrial Revolution, which began in the mid-18th century and created the first modern industrial nation.\n\"When the history of the first half of the 21st century is written, it will be about China. China has one-fifth of the world's population, and has experienced redistribution from an impoverished nation to a nation setting the pace, from an entirely closed one to one that boasts the most internet users in the world,\" he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrew sheng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen roach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "li keqiang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roach", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "yale university's jackson institute for global affairs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national people's congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morgan stanley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia global institute", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T11:46:32.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bfea24d278c9594efa37fe098d14ec6c767a1f37", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/share-market-update-private-bank-shares-mixed-idfc-first-bank-dips-2/articleshow/68685868.cms", "site_full": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/markets/stocks/markets/stocks/stocks-in-news/rssfeeds/2146843.cms", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "News-Stocks-Markets-Economic Times", "title": "IDFC First Bank share price: Share market update: Private Bank shares mixed;

In recent days I have shared a whole bunch of numbers with my readers that clearly demonstrate that a new economic downturn has begun. And even though stock prices have been rising, the numbers for the \u201creal economy\u201d have been depressingly bad lately. But what we didn\u2019t have was official confirmation from the Federal Reserve that the economy is really slowing down, but now we do. According to the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow model, the economy is growing \u201cat a 0.3 percent annualized rate in the first quarter\u201d \u2026\nThe U.S. economy is growing at a 0.3 percent annualized rate in the first quarter , based on data on domestic construction spending in December released on Monday, the Atlanta Federal Reserve\u2019s GDPNow forecast model showed.\nFor years, the goal has been to get U.S. growth above the key 3 percent threshold, but what this forecast is telling us is that economic growth is currently at one-tenth of that level.\nThat is just barely above recession territory.\nSo when I say that we are teetering on the brink of a recession, I am not exaggerating.\nWe also just got some really bad news about construction spending \u2026\nConstruction spending fell 0.6% in December from November, based on a seasonally adjusted annual rate, released today by the Commerce Department. Compared to December a year earlier, total construction spending inched up only 0.8% ( not seasonally adjusted ), the lowest growth rate since Oct 2011, coming out of the great recession.\nNow we can add that to the list of all the other numbers that are telling us that very rough times are ahead.\nMeanwhile, debt levels in the U.S. just continue to explode.\nAccording to the latest report, Americans now have 480 million credit cards . That is about 100 million more than during the last recession.\nIn other words, there are about 1.5 credit cards for every man, woman and child in the entire country.\nThe total amount of credit card debt in the United States has now reached a whopping $870,000,000,000 . That number has never been higher in the history of our nation.\nAnd when you total up all forms of individual debt, U.S. consumers are now 13.5 trillion dollars in the hole.\nCorporate debt levels are exploding as well, and this is something that Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan warned about on Tuesday \u2026\nU.S. nonfinancial corporate debt consists mostly of bonds and loans. This category of debt, as a percentage of gross domestic product, is now higher than in the prior peak reached at the end of 2008 , Kaplan said.\nA number of studies have concluded this level of credit could \u201cpotentially amplify the severity of a recession,\u201d he noted.\nThe lowest level of investment-grade debt, BBB bonds, has grown from $800 million to $2.7 trillion by year-end 2018. High-yield debt has grown from $700 million to $1.1 trillion over the same period. This trend has been accompanied by more relaxed bond and loan covenants, he added.\nOverall, corporate debt has more than doubled since the last financial crisis, and that is just one of the reasons why our financial system is far more vulnerable today than it was just before the last financial crisis.\nThis week we also learned that the federal budget deficit is exploding as well. The following comes from Business Insider \u2026\nAccording to a report from the Treasury Department released Tuesday, the budget deficit \u2014 that is the difference between what the federal government takes in and what it spends \u2014 hit $310 billion in the first four months of fiscal year 2019 .\nFiscal years for the federal government run October through September, so the data reflects the shortfall from October 2018 through January 2019. Based on the data, the deficit increased by 77% compared to the same period the prior year .\nA 77 percent increase in one year?\nI don\u2019t even have the words to describe how foolish this is.\nWe are on pace to add way over a trillion dollars to the national debt this year, and one of the big things fueling this horrific debt binge is our rapidly expanding interest payments \u2026\nFinally, and perhaps most concerning, is that for the first four months of this fiscal year, interest payments on the U.S. national debt hit $192 billion, $17 billion, or 10% more than in the same four-month period last year and the most interest ever paid in the first third of the fiscal year . As Reuters\u2019 Jeoff Hall points out, annualizing the $192BN interest expense means that the interest on U.S. public debt is on track to reach a record $575 billion this fiscal year, more than the entire budget deficit in FY 2014 ($483 BN) or FY 2015 ($439 BN), and equates to 2.7% of estimated GDP, the highest percentage since 2011.\nBut according to the proponents of modern monetary theory (MMT), we can spend as much money as we want because \u201cdeficits almost never matter\u201d \u2026\nBecause MMT holds that government spending isn\u2019t funded by taxes, the Green New Deal doesn\u2019t include any measures to finance the very large, open-ended fiscal commitments it would undertake. According to MMT economists, the only possible danger from the resultant government debt would be inflation, which can usually be controlled with tools other than raising taxes. In other words, deficits almost never matter. So confident are they of their theory\u2019s universal applicability that MMT proponents often respond to their critics with scorn.\nIf you can believe it, there are actually members of Congress that believe this stuff. Of course the truth is that our national debt is an existential threat to the continued existence of our nation, and this is a point that I have made repeatedly .\nThe U.S. economy was in far better shape just prior to the financial crisis of 2008 than it is now, and today we are drowning in far more debt than we were at that time.\nThe stage is set for the most terrifying economic horror show in American history, and the clock is ticking away with each passing day.\nSource:

The U.S. dollar rose to a three-week high.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia has left interest rates unchanged and avoided the outright dovish tone of some other central banks, but traders still treated its policy statement as bad for the currency.\nThe RBA&apos;s stress on the \"downside risks for the global growth environment\" probably caused the currency to weaken, said Commerzbank (DE: CBKG ) analyst Esther Reichelt.\nShe said the government&apos;s budget due on Tuesday should provide some supportive measures. Combined with optimism over China, she said, that should help the Aussie to rebound.\nAustralia&apos;s dollar dropped 0.6 percent to $0.7072 AUD=D3 .\nThe euro, which has also been weakened by a dovish central bank, fell 0.2 percent to $1.1196 EUR=EBS in London on Tuesday -- its weakest since March 8 -- as the U.S. dollar gained.\nThe dollar index , which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of rival currencies, rose 0.3 percent to 97.430 .DXY , a three-week high.\nSterling dropped half a percent after lawmakers rejected four Brexit proposals, heightening Britain&apos;s uncertainty just 10 days before it is due to leave the European Union. The pound was down at $1.3044 GBP=D3 and at 85.84 pence against the euro EURGBP=D3 .\nThe safe-haven Swiss franc held below 1.12 per euro and near 2019 highs. It traded 0.1 percent higher at 1.1186 EURCHF=EBS , below 2019 highs of 1.117.\nRBC Capital Markets strategist Adam Cole said he did not expect the franc to hold its gains because the Swiss National Bank remained \"sensitive\" to a stronger currency, particularly when it traded below 1.12 francs versus the euro.\nThe SNB will be \"the last central bank in the developed world to tighten rates,\" he said.\nCryptocurrencies surged.

Advertisement\nMorrison and Frydenberg have five or six weeks to persuade Australians that their government's past should be forgiven in favour of today's beneficence. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen\nIt gives new meaning to that caustic term \"election budget\", which has always carried with it the whiff of laboured excess in pursuit of political fortune.\nNormally, even election-year budgets are brought down months before polling day, giving voters a respectable period to digest the detail before taking their judgment to the booths.\nThis time, the gap between today's budget and election day will be no more than five or six weeks.\nAssuming Morrison calls the election this Sunday, April 7, as predicted, Australia will go to the polls on Saturday, May 11, or at the latest, May 18.\nIn other words, the budget is effectively announcing the election campaign. Its contents - the hand-outs, the projected surpluses, the tax breaks - are by extension the Coalition's last-gasp campaign weaponry, apart from the inevitable scare campaigns about Labor and the Greens, and the jabbing at Bill Shorten's lack of popularity.\nAnd why?\nGovernments facing elections normally have a broad suite of campaign messages built and refined over their period in power, ready to go as election-campaign boasting points.\nClaims to political stability and economic responsibility always share top billing, along with policies on national security, health, education, employment, environment, defence, infrastructure, agriculture and the like.\nThe Morrison government's problem is that whenever it has tried to elevate a message of policy strength, it has found itself hog-tied by instability, scandal or political cackhandedness.\nThe botched leadership challenge by Peter Dutton that led to Morrison becoming prime minister; the loss of Malcolm Turnbull's blue-riband seat to an independent; accusations by Liberal women of bullying, leading to Julia Banks' defection; the debacle when Liberal senators initially supported a One Nation motion that \"it's OK to be white\"; the Liberal Party's crisis in Victoria and the Nationals' disaster in NSW after state elections; the infighting over climate and energy; the loss of a House of Representatives vote on medical evacuations for asylum seekers.\nAll these and more created a rolling sense of crisis.\nEven Morrison's spectacular $1 billion decision to reopen the Christmas Island detention centre in an attempt to paint Labor as a danger to border protection seems now to have been a one-week wonder.\nMorrison, of course, has been leader only a few days longer than seven months. The Coalition's dysfunction goes back much longer.\nNo voter needs reminding that this administration has had three prime ministers in less than six years.\nApart from a period after Turnbull snatched the leadership from Tony Abbott in 2015, citing Abbott's losing streak of 30 successive polls, the Coalition government's polling results have been consistently disastrous. It has not won a single public poll (two-party preferred) since mid-2016.\nThus, the pressure on Morrison and Frydenberg's pre-election budget to turn around the Coalition's fortunes is immense.\nHistory shows that budgeting skills can go a long way towards political success.\nJohn Howard and Peter Costello made an art form out of presenting rolling surpluses and middle-class largesse as evidence of responsible economic stewardship, and voters rewarded them for a decade.\nBob Hawke and Paul Keating were celebrated for persuading the electorate that huge reforms to the financial and economic systems were necessary and, as Keating claimed in 1988, a worthwhile budget could \"bring home the bacon\".\nBoth of those long-lived governments, however, took great pains to explain over long periods what they were doing and why.\nIn contrast, Morrison - often described as a marketing man - is overseeing a budget that appears to have echoes of an old-time closing-down sale, where the marketing cry was \"everything must go\". Plenty of those sales, of course, were so successful they went on for years.\nThe evidence that last-minute federal budgets can achieve such feats is scant, however - not least because Australia has never had such an eleventh-hour effort as this one.

At 6 pm, the local unit was traded at 4.0790/0820 against the greenback from 4.0800/0850 at last Friday\u2019s closing. A dealer said the ringgit also rebounded from last week\u2019s lower performance, as the greenback retreated from recent gains on profit-taking. He said the US Federal Reserve\u2019s indication that there would be no interest rate increase for this year but only a single hike in 2020, gave positive news to emerging market currencies including the ringgit. \u201cMeanwhile, the higher crude oil prices, with benchmark Brent crude futures currently at US$68.63 per barrel, had supported the ringgit, as Malaysia, being a net exporter of oil and gas, is heavily dependent on the price movements of the commodity,\u201d he said. The ringgit traded mostly lower against a basket of major currencies. It declined against the Singapore dollar to 3.0114/0141 from Friday\u2019s close of 3.0086/0128, depreciated against the British pound to 5.3419/3474 from 5.3122/3203 and fell against the euro to 4.5832/5882 from 4.5737/5809. However, the local note appreciated against the Japanese yen to 3.6744/6781 from 3.6820/6872 previously. - Bernama Share this More articles:\nKL shares mixed at opening on cautious trading - Apr 04, 2019 Ringgit flat against US dollar in early session - Apr 04, 2019 Resorts World Las Vegas sells debut $1 bln bond to fund resort - Apr 03, 2019 Ringgit rebounds to end higher against US dollar - Apr 03, 2019 Investors push Bursa Malaysia higher at midweek - Apr 03, 2019 Ringgit ends lower against US dollar - Apr 02, 2019", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Ringgit", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/fdnews/246803.jsp&p", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/fdnews/246803.jsp"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "us federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T13:43:57.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9387e7a6eafb88d8d6b5ff0990759a7191235282", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-news-opening-bell-april-2-2019-2019-4", "site_full": "www.businessinsider.com", "site": "businessinsider.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Stock market news: Opening bell, April 2, 2019 - Business Insider", "title_full": "Stock market news: Opening bell, April 2, 2019 - Business Insider", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5ca33d21c6cc5032177b05e4-2732-1366.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 283, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9387e7a6eafb88d8d6b5ff0990759a7191235282", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-news-opening-bell-april-2-2019-2019-4", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jonathan Garber", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Stock market news: Opening bell, April 2, 2019 - Business Insider", "text": "10 things you need to know before the opening bell Jonathan Garber twitter\nHere is what you need to know.

The US Census Bureau is scheduled to release the monthly report at 12:30 GMT and consensus estimates predict a 1.8% m/m fall during the reported month, down from a downwardly revised 0.3% rise in the previous month. Excluding transportation items - core durable goods orders, which tend to have a broader impact than the volatile headline figures are anticipated to rise 0.2% in February as against January's adjusted 0.2% fall.\nAs Joseph Trevisani, FXStreet's own Senior Analyst explained: \u201cThe relative weakness in the February retail sales figures, missing forecasts by 0.5% in the overall number, and 0.6% in the control group might argue for lowering expectations in its sub-category of durable goods. But the large upward revision in the January sales numbers and the potential for positive adjustments to February\u2019s results bring the balance to neutral. On the other hand, better performance in the February durable statistics is a strong hint that the retail numbers are understated.\u201d\nDeviation impact on EUR/USD\nReaders can find FX Street's proprietary deviation impact map of the event below. As observed, the reaction is likely to be in the range of 20-25 pips during the first 15-minutes in case of a deviation from +0.36 to -0.51 and could extend up to 51-55 pips in the following 4-hours.\nEUR/USD important levels to watch\nYohay Elam, FXStreet's own Analyst offers some important technical levels ahead of the important release: \u201cThe Technical Confluences Indicator shows that the 21-month low of 1.1176 is also the confluence of the Pivot Point one-week Support 1, the PP one-day S2, and the Bollinger Band one-day Lower. On the downside, the only noteworthy support area below 1.1176 is 1.1115 which is the PP one-month S1.\u201d\n\u201cResistance is also close and it is a bit softer. At 1.1221 we see a dense cluster of levels including the Fibonacci 23.6% one-day, the previous yearly low, the Simple Moving Average 100-15m, the SMA 10-4h, the BB 15min-Upper, the SMA 5-4h, the previous 4h-high, and the BB 1h-Middle. Further above, significant resistance awaits at 1.1285 which is the convergence of the Fibonacci 161.8% one-day, the Fibonacci 38.2% one-month, the SMA 200-1h, the Fibonacci 61.8% one-week, the PP 1d-R3, and the BB 1d-Middle,\u201d he added further.\nKey Notes", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "haresh menghani", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "joseph trevisani", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "us census bureau", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T14:11:23.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f2f25fd71d30485f169e5104018e6814ae69c05d", "url": "https://za.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/briefold-mutual-completes-sale-of-latin-american-businesses-1440711", "site_full": "za.investing.com", "site": "investing.com", "site_section": "https://za.investing.com/news/stock-market-news", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Stock Market News - Investing.com ZA", "title": "BRIEF-Old Mutual Completes Sale Of Latin American Businesses By Reuters", "title_full": "BRIEF-Old Mutual Completes Sale Of Latin American Businesses By Reuters", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.127, "main_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC701IA_L.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 699, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f2f25fd71d30485f169e5104018e6814ae69c05d", "url": "https://za.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/briefold-mutual-completes-sale-of-latin-american-businesses-1440711", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Reuters", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "BRIEF-Old Mutual Completes Sale Of Latin American Businesses By Reuters", "text": "\u00a9 Reuters.

The U.S. dollar rose to a three-week high.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia has left interest rates unchanged and avoided the outright dovish tone of some other central banks, but traders still treated its policy statement as bad for the currency.\nThe RBA&apos;s stress on the \"downside risks for the global growth environment\" probably caused the currency to weaken, said Commerzbank (DE: CBKG ) analyst Esther Reichelt.\nShe said the government&apos;s budget due on Tuesday should provide some supportive measures. Combined with optimism over China, she said, that should help the Aussie to rebound.\nAustralia&apos;s dollar dropped 0.6 percent to $0.7072 AUD=D3 .\nThe euro, which has also been weakened by a dovish central bank, fell 0.2 percent to $1.1196 EUR=EBS in London on Tuesday -- its weakest since March 8 -- as the U.S. dollar gained.\nThe dollar index , which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of rival currencies, rose 0.3 percent to 97.430 .DXY , a three-week high.\nSterling dropped half a percent after lawmakers rejected four Brexit proposals, heightening Britain&apos;s uncertainty just 10 days before it is due to leave the European Union. The pound was down at $1.3044 GBP=D3 and at 85.84 pence against the euro EURGBP=D3 .\nThe safe-haven Swiss franc held below 1.12 per euro and near 2019 highs. It traded 0.1 percent higher at 1.1186 EURCHF=EBS , below 2019 highs of 1.117.\nRBC Capital Markets strategist Adam Cole said he did not expect the franc to hold its gains because the Swiss National Bank remained \"sensitive\" to a stronger currency, particularly when it traded below 1.12 francs versus the euro.\nThe SNB will be \"the last central bank in the developed world to tighten rates,\" he said.\nCryptocurrencies surged.

It dropped a previous call for 3 percent economic growth this year, following disappointing data for late 2018, but reiterated that the jobs market remained strong. Subdued economic data also led the government to downgrade its forecasts. Growth was projected at 2.25 percent in the current financial year, then 2.75 percent in the next two years.\nFrydenberg pointed to some \"clear and genuine risks\" at home and abroad even as the base case was for the economy to continue its uninterrupted growth run.\n\"The residential housing market has cooled, credit growth has eased and we are yet to see the full impact of flood and drought on the economy,\" he said.\nFrydenberg also noted threats to Australia's export-heavy economy from global trade tensions and China's growth slowdown.\nThe return to surplus together with the tax largesse failed to cheer investors with the Australian dollar trading near the day's low at $0.7074. The Aussie had slipped after the RBA's decision.\nSTEADY UNEMPLOYMENT\nNet debt, seen falling to 18 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019/20, is projected to be eliminated by 2029/30.\nThe unemployment rate, which fell to an eight-year low of 4.9 percent in February, is seen at 5 percent over the forecast period.\nConsumer price inflation is seen at 2.25 percent in 2019/20 before 2.5 percent the next year, within the RBA's 2-3 percent medium-term target.\nStill, an increasing number of economists expect the RBA to cut interest rates later in 2019 largely due to a deeper-than-expected housing downturn.\nHome prices fell for a 17th straight month in March and are now down about 7.4 percent since peaking in October 2017. The losses are particularly steep in the biggest markets of Sydney and Melbourne, raising fears indebted households would further cut back on spending.\n($1 = 1.408 Australian dollars)\n(Reporting by Swati Pandey; Editing by John Mair and Richard Borsuk) Messaging: swati.pandey.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net; twitter.com/swatisays)) Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and may not reflect those of Kitco Metals Inc.

Nevertheless, we believe the RBI will refrain from more aggressive easing, given the uncertainty around the monsoon outlook, the inclination towards populist fiscal policies around elections, and the need to assess transmission by banks.\"\nGlobal markets upbeat World stocks hovered just under a six-month high on Tuesday as Brent inched up towards $70 a barrel for the first time since November, Brexit fatigue sapped sterling and the dollar showed signs of gaining strength again.\nMost European bourses posted slight gains early on, helped by Britain's exporter-heavy FTSE 100, which climbed as much as 0.5 per cent as exporters cheered the fourth fall in sterling in the last five days. Chinese blue-chips scored a 10-month high having leapfrogged Colombia to the top of the leaderboard of world share markets, Reuters reported.\nRupee rebounds The domestic currency made a smart bounce on Tuesday. It was some 20 paise higher after slipping by the same value in the opening trade. Besides FII inflows, hopes of an RBI rate cut are what fed the rupee bulls.\nExpert Take\nVinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services Ltd\nMarket maintained the positive momentum, but struggled to cross above the all-time high due to profit booking in which mid and small caps underperformed. Inflow of foreign liquidity in expectation of rate cut from RBI and revival in earnings will provide some stability in the market.\"\n0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.ecoti.in/rKckua", "http://www.ecoti.in/e43oWY", "http://www.ecoti.in/98tRzY", "http://www.ecoti.in/VtZBFZ78"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "nse nifty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaguar land rover", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tata motors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T14:36:58.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3e088dceba3b366097933188fc4b849047e0db6a", "url": "https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/ugi-corp-to-buy-75-per-cent-of-amerigas-partners-in-2-44-bn-deal/68688976", "site_full": "energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "business", "green_solutions"], "section_title": "", "title": "UGI Corp to buy 75 per cent of AmeriGas Partners in $2.44-bn deal, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld", "title_full": "UGI Corp to buy 75 per cent of AmeriGas Partners in $2.44-bn deal, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.979, "main_image": "https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-68688976,imgsize-79194,width-800,height-434,overlay-etenergyworld/ugi-corp-to-buy-75-per-cent-of-amerigas-partners-in-2-44-bn-deal.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3e088dceba3b366097933188fc4b849047e0db6a", "url": "https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/ugi-corp-to-buy-75-per-cent-of-amerigas-partners-in-2-44-bn-deal/68688976", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "UGI Corp to buy 75 per cent of AmeriGas Partners in $2.44-bn deal, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld", "text": "amerigas partners UGI Corp to buy 75 per cent of AmeriGas Partners in $2.44-bn deal The offer represents a premium of 13.5 per cent to AmeriGas' Monday closing price REUTERS | April 02, 2019, 17:18 IST Newsletter A A Energy distributor UGI Corp said on Tuesday it will buy the nearly 75 percent it does not own in retail propane marketer AmeriGas Partners in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $2.44 billion.UGI Corp, which is headquartered in Pennsylvania, also updated its fiscal 2019 profit guidance to the range of $2.40-$2.60 per share from $2.75-$2.95 due to significantly warmer-than-normal winter in its European markets.

Securities analyst Annette Beacher said the \"targetted fiscal stimulus\" in the budget - which includes A$15 billion worth of tax cuts over 2021/22 - negates the need for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to ease policy.\nJust hours before the budget statement, the RBA kept rates at a record low 1.50 percent for a 32nd straight month. dropped a previous call for 3 percent economic growth this year, following disappointing data for late 2018, but reiterated that the jobs market remained strong. economic data also led the government to downgrade its forecasts.

( Alessandra Tarantino / AP Photo ) Juncker noted that when the EU approved Italy\u2019s controversial budget expanding social spending, the commission projected Italian growth at 1.2 per cent for 2019.\nItaly has since fallen into a technical recession, and various bodies have lowered growth estimates for the year, including Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which says Italy\u2019s economy is likely to contract 0.2 per cent this year.\nIn its report this week, the OECD called for bold reforms to tackle low productivity as well as social and regional inequalities.\n The OECD was especially critical of the basic income scheme backed by the 5-Star Movement, saying it risks weakening work incentives and creating poverty traps given the relatively high payments compared with similar schemes in other member states.\nConte said that his government this week would approve a decree \u201cwith measures that will give impulse to growth.\u201d\nBut he also said that the slowdown was expected, \u201cand that is why we conceived of a budget that wants to follow expansive but responsible policies, approving measures that the country needed for too long to re-establish social equality.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "juncker", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jean-claude juncker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giuseppe conte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alessandra tarantino", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ap photo ) european commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palazzo chigi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rome", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T15:39:45.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "96cad1f5eb7691e7c8af9c9a7220642b49ad4a35", "url": "http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/3/12/329272/Business/Economy/Egypt-current-account-deficit-widens,-tourism-pick.aspx", "site_full": "english.ahram.org.eg", "site": "ahram.org.eg", "site_section": "http://english.ahram.org.eg/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Ahram Online - News, Business, Culture, Sports &amp; Multimedia from Egypt ", "title": "Egypt current account deficit widens, tourism picks up, FDI falls - Economy - Business", "title_full": "Egypt current account deficit widens, tourism picks up, FDI falls - Economy - Business - Ahram Online", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "EG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3598, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "96cad1f5eb7691e7c8af9c9a7220642b49ad4a35", "url": "http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/3/12/329272/Business/Economy/Egypt-current-account-deficit-widens,-tourism-pick.aspx", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Reuters", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Egypt current account deficit widens, tourism picks up, FDI falls - Economy - Business", "text": "Egypt\u2019s current account deficit widened to $2.1 billion in the last three months of 2018 from a deficit of $1.78 billion in the same period a year previously, according to Reuters calculations based on central bank data released on Monday.\nTourism improved in Egypt.

Petroleum imports declined to $2.36 billion from $3.23 billion year-on-year. Egypt became a net exporter of natural gas in late 2018.\nThe central bank had previously separated petroleum investments but did not do so in the report released on Monday.\nThe trade deficit narrowed to $9.36 billion in the quarter from $9.84 billion in the second quarter of the 2017/2018 financial year.\n\u201cThe petroleum trade balance will continue to improve on the back of gas exports,\u201d said Radwa El-Swaify, head of research at Pharos Securities Brokerage. \u201cThe non-petroleum trade deficit should stabilise pending an improvement in exports.\u201d\nSuez Canal revenues edged up to $1.49 billion in the quarter from $1.39 billion year-on-year.\nExpatriate remittances fell to $6.14 billion in the quarter from $7.1 billion year-on-year.\nThe overall balance of payments registered a deficit of $2.06 billion during the quarter, the second quarter of the fiscal year beginning in July. It registered a surplus of $515.2 million in the same period last year.\n\u201cHopefully, tourism will continue to outperform,\u201d El-Swaify said. \u201cAnd foreign portfolio investments have actually reversed their trend, so this is an item that will change going forward.\u201d\nEgypt\u2019s economy has struggled to lure back foreign investors and tourists since a 2011 uprising drove them away. In late 2016, it signed a $12 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund to boost growth.\nAs part of the plan, the government imposed economic reforms that have strained the budgets of millions of Egyptians, among them devaluing the currency, cutting energy subsidies and introducing a value-added tax.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://adserver.adtech.de/adserv/3.0/1425/6622549/0/170/ADTECH;loc=300", "http://adserver.adtech.de/adlink/3.0/1425/6622549/0/170/ADTECH;loc=300", "http://adserver.adtech.de/addyn/3.0/1425/6622549/0/170/ADTECH;loc=100;target=_blank;grp="], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yara elkahky", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "naeem brokerage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T15:43:46.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5ae754f008f3c87b3a7f711e05e4f7f4b63f288d", "url": "https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/bitcoin-rollercoaster-ride-sends-it-above-5000-and-kicks-it-to-4750--what-is-next-for-btcusd-1824996", "site_full": "www.investing.com", "site": "investing.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin rollercoaster ride sends it above $5,000 and kicks it to $4,750 \u2013 What is next for BTC/USD?

At 03:21 GMT, the AUD/USD is trading .7109, down 0.0005 or -0.06%. Daily AUD/USD More Daily Technical Analysis The main trend is up according to the daily swing chart. However, momentum is trending lower. A trade through .7168 will signal a resumption of the uptrend. A move through .7041 will change the main trend to down. The minor trend is down. This is driving the momentum. A trade through .7133 will change the minor trend to up and shift momentum to the upside. A move through .7064 will reaffirm the downtrend. The AUD/USD is also caught inside a pair of retracement zones that have been causing a choppy, two-sided trade for nearly three months. The major retracement zone at .7079 to .7153 is controlling the longer-term direction of the AUD/USD. The short-term range is being controlled by the retracement zone at .7105 to .7129. Daily Technical Forecast Based on the early price action, the direction of the AUD/USD on Tuesday is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the 50% level at .7105. Bullish Scenario A sustained move over .7105 will indicate the presence of buyers. If this creates enough upside momentum then look for a rally into a resistance cluster at .7128 to .7129. Taking out .7129 will lead to a test of .7133. This could trigger an extension of the rally into a downtrending Gann angle at .7148 and the main Fibonacci level at .7153. This is the last potential resistance level before the .7168 main top. Bearish Scenario A sustained move under .7105 will signal the presence of sellers. This could drive the AUD/USD into a pair of uptrending Gann angles at .7088 and .7079. Taking out .7079 could trigger an acceleration to the downside with the next major targets .7064 and an uptrending Gann angle at .7046. The latter is the last major support before a 50% level at .7030.

The yield curve is first and foremost predicting the outlook for Fed policy rather than the next recession. My research has confirmed this conclusion, as does a recent Fed study.\nIn my recent book, Predicting the Markets , Quote: : \u201cThe Yield Curve Model is based on investors\u2019 expectations of how the Fed will respond to inflation. It is more practical for predicting interest rates than is the Inflation Premium Model. It makes sense that the federal-funds rate depends mostly on the Fed\u2019s inflation outlook, and that all the other yields to the right of this rate on the yield curve are determined by investors\u2019 expectations for the Fed policy cycle.\u201d\nMore specifically, after studying the relationship between the yield curve and the monetary, credit, and business cycles, we have concluded that it is credit crunches, not inverted yield curve, and not aging economic expansions that cause recessions. The yield curve is just keeping score on how the Fed is reacting to and influencing these cycles. So why do inverted yield curves have such a good track record in calling recessions , and could it be different this time ?\n: The yield curve inverted \u2014 here are 5 things investors need to know\nAccording to a July 2018 Fed study about the yield curve, the probability of a recession was around 14%. However, a February 2019 update of this study reported that the odds had risen to 50%. That recession warning might have contributed to the remarkable pivot from a hawkish to a dovish stance by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets the Fed\u2019s monetary policy.\nThe Fed recently signaled that there won\u2019t be any rate hikes this year and only one next year. If so, this should reduce the chances of a recession. Let\u2019s have a close look at the Fed study, which confirms our view about the best interpretation of the yield curve:\nLast year, the minutes of the June 12-13 FOMC meeting offered a reason not to worry about the flattening yield curve at that time. During the meeting, Fed staff presented an alternative \u201cindicator of the likelihood of recession\u201d based on research explained in a June 28 FEDS Notes titled \u201c(Don't Fear) The Yield Curve\u201d by two Fed economists, Eric C. Engstrom and Steven A. Sharpe. In brief, they questioned why a \u201clong-term spread\u201d between the 10-year (BX:TMUBMUSD10Y) and two-year (BX:TMUBMUSD02Y) Treasury notes should have much power to predict imminent recessions. As an alternative, they devised a 0- to-6-quarter \u201cnear-term forward spread\u201d based on the spread between the current level of the federal-funds rate and the expected federal-funds rate several quarters ahead, derived from futures market prices ( Fig. 1 ).\nThe authors stressed that the long-term spread reflects the near-term spread, which they argue makes more sense as an indicator of a recession that is expected to occur within the next few quarters. They also observe that an inversion of either yield spread does not mean that the spread causes recessions.\nAt the time, their assessment was that \u2018the market is putting fairly low odds on a rate cut over the next four quarters,\u2019 i.e., 14.1% ( Fig. 2 ). \u201cUnlike far-term yield spreads, the near-term forward spread has not been trending down in recent years, and survey-based measures of longer-term expectations for short term interest rates show no sign of an expected inversion,\u201d they observed. In our commentary last year, we concluded: \u201cWhat a relief! So now, all we have to worry about is a recession caused by a trade war!\u201d\n(provided by The Street)\nClick to expand Replay Video UP NEXT Nor'easter strengthens off the East Coast An April Nor'easter is taking shape along the Carolina Coast which will impact the major metro cities of the Northeast by Wednesday.

The near-term spread \u201cpredicts four-quarter GDP growth with greater accuracy than survey consensus forecasts. Furthermore, \u201cit has substantial predictive power for stock returns,\u201d find the Fed economists. In contrast, yields on bonds \u201cmaturing beyond 6-8 quarters are shown to have no added value for forecasting either recessions, GDP growth, or stock returns.\u201d\nBuried on page 7 of the new study is a warning that the probability of a recession had increased significantly since the original study was done about a year ago: \u201cAs of the end of the sample period in early 2019 (and the time of this writing), the near term forward spreads forecast a substantially elevated probability of a recession.\u201d\nIndeed, Figure 3 in the study clearly shows that recession risk jumped to 50% (based on first-quarter 2019 data available only through January). Interestingly, this important update wasn\u2019t mentioned in the summary paragraph at the beginning of the study. However, the charts in the paper show that the odds of a recession increase most significantly when the near-term forward spread is markedly below zero, which it was not as of the most recent analysis.\nAccordingly, we\u2019re not freaking out about an impending recession. We are focusing on the idea promoted in the Fed study (and in my book) that the yield curve first and foremost is predicting the outlook for monetary policy. For example, the paper noted that \u201cthe near-term forward spread would tend to turn negative when investors decide that the Fed is likely to soon switch from a tightening to an easing stance.\u201d\nThe yield-curve spread tends to narrow during periods when the Fed is raising the federal-funds rate ( Fig. 3 ). It tends to bottom and then widen when the Fed starts to lower interest rates. It just so happens that past recessions occurred after the yield curve inverted, i.e., at the tail end of monetary tightening cycles.\nIt might be different this time, if the Fed has paused on a timely basis from raising interest rates any further, thus reducing the chances of a recession. After all, there\u2019s no need to overdo tightening given that inflation and speculative excesses remain subdued. In the past, Fed tightening (not inverted yield curves that coincided with tightening) led to financial crises, which morphed into widespread credit crunches, resulting in recessions ( Fig. 4 ).\nHence our conclusion that it is credit crunches that cause recessions, not inverted yield curves and not aging expansions.\nDrawing parallels between monetary policy in 1998 and today, Engstrom\u2019s and Sharpe\u2019s paper stated: \u201cThe most prominent false positive during our sample came with the anticipated easing triggered by the spread of the Asian financial crises in 1998, which did not result in a recession in the U.S. It is not hard to imagine that similar scenarios could generate additional false positives in the future. The near-inversion of the near term forward spread at the end of 2018 seems to have been associated with market perceptions of significant risks to the global economic outlook, including the threat of escalating trade disputes. Whether those risks manifest in a recession remains to be seen.\u201d\nThe Fed study notes: \u201cWe define the near-term forward spread on any given day as the difference between the implied interest rate expected on a three-month Treasury bill six quarters ahead and the current yield on a three-month Treasury bill.\u201d\nAccording to Haver Analytics (our data vendor): \u201cWe had been in touch with the Board about the 0-to-6 Quarter Forward Spread earlier this year and they had told us they calculated it using an internal fitted zero coupon curve in quarterly maturities. They only make annual maturities available at the moment so we cannot calculate.\u201d\nSo instead of trying to calculate the Fed study\u2019s near-term spread, we will focus on the 12-month forward futures for the federal-funds rate, which is available daily ( Fig. 5 ). The two-year Treasury note yield tracks this series closely, suggesting that it is also a good proxy for the market\u2019s prediction of the federal-funds rate a year from now.\nAfter all that work, the conclusion is the obvious one: The Fed isn\u2019t likely to be raising the federal-funds rate over the next 12 months. Last Monday, the 12-month forward rate was 2.06%, 32 basis points below the 2.38% midpoint of the federal-funds rate target range. The two-year was 2.24%, 14 basis points below the midpoint late last week.\nThe Fed study suggests to us that the spread between the two-year Treasury yield and the federal-funds rate may be the simplest way to track the fixed-income market\u2019s outlook for monetary policy over the next 52 weeks ( Fig. 6 ). Anyone can do this at home. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the market will be right, as evidenced by how wrong it turned out to be last year.\nThe bottom line: For now, we still don\u2019t see a significant risk of a recession, especially since the FOMC remains \u201cpatient.\u201d The committee\u2019s recent decision to pause hiking the federal-funds rate over the rest of this year reduces the risk of a financial crisis triggering both a credit crunch and a recession.\nEd Yardeni is president of Yardeni Research, Inc.

NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Levi Strauss's return to the public markets got an enthusiastic reception from investors who believe the iconic brand is ready for a comeback \u2014 and still has a lot more room to grow. The stock, which is listed under the ticker \"LEVI,\" opened for trading Thursday at $22.22, above the $17 offering price and blowing past the originally expected range of $14 to $16. As of Thursday's close, shares popped nearly 32 percent, closing at $22.41 per share. That gave Levi's a market value of $8.64 billion, according to FactSet. Levi's seems to have successfully convinced investors, at least for now, that it has a lot of opportunities to expand beyond just jeans, from tops to bolstering its women's business. In its prospectus, the company says it plans to use the proceeds from the public offering to expand more aggressively into China, India and Brazil and also build out more retail stores, which as of late last year totaled 824. But jeans are still the company's mainstay and that was apparent on Thursday, when in a rare move the New York Stock Exchange suspended its \"no jeans\" policy to commemorate Levi's re-entry, transforming the floor from suits and ties into a sea of blue denim, with its traders sporting jeans and denim jackets. More than 120 employees from Levi's global offices, including its CEO Chip Bergh outfitted in denim, were on the trading floor. On Wednesday, the NYSE even Tweeted, \"Tomorrow we'll be in our 501s.\" The 166-year-old company is proving to Wall Street there's staying power for a legacy name that dates back to 1853 when its namesake founder started a wholesales dry goods business in San Francisco. Strauss and tailor Jacob Davis invented jeans 20 years later after receiving a patent to create cotton denim workpants with copper rivets in certain areas like the pocket corner to make them stronger. By the 1920s, Levi's original 501 jeans had become top-selling men's workpants, according to its corporate website. Levi's previously went public in 1971, but Strauss' descendants, the Haas family, took it private again in 1985. Today, it stands out from a string of tech companies \u2014 from Spotify to Dropbox \u2014 that have made their debuts in the public markets in recent months. \"I would like to say we're the original Silicon Valley startup,\" said Bergh, dressed in 501 jeans and a denim jacket, during an interview with The Associated Press at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. \"We started during the Gold Rush, and we are still headquartered in San Francisco. And I do think that that story has resonated with investors.\" The IPO comes amid increasing competition and a changing retail landscape. Women are opting for yoga pants or other comfortable athletic sportswear that can be worn every day. And Levi's is contending with a shrinking number of department stores, once its traditional venue of distribution. Discounters like Walmart have also been developing their own exclusive brands. Read more: More than 5,800 stores are closing in 2019 as the retail apocalypse drags on \u2014 here's the full list Since assuming the helm in 2011, Bergh has refashioned the brand and image. It didn't chase after the yoga trend but rather focused on enhancing the fit of its women's jeans with stretchier fabrics. Bergh also has created buzz with partnerships with celebrities like Justin Timberlake while increasing Levi's marketing at events like Coachella, where Beyonce performed in the brand's cut-off shorts. At the same time, Levi's has been expanding online and juggling between selling to low-end and high-end stores. Bergh told AP that it's capitalized on its resurgence and that even as the brand saw 300 store closures, Levi's enjoyed an 8 percent growth in sales to its wholesale accounts. All of that has helped Levi Strauss turn in a 14 percent increase in sales to $5.6 billion for the year ended Nov. 25, 2018, a big inflection point for the brand. The timing may be right for Levi's. Jeans sales appear to be on an upswing in the U.S., increasing 2.2 percent to $16.7 billion last year after four straight years of declines, according to data from Euromonitor. \"Things go in waves,\" says Marie Driscoll, managing director of luxury and fashion at Coresight Research. \"The athleisure trend made denim not as comfortable. But denim brands have responded by adding stretch.\" It wasn't long ago when Levi's was struggling with a big debt load and had grown too reliant on department stores. During its worst slump, the company's sales went from $6.8 billion in 1997, when it helped to drive the Casual Friday trend with its Dockers khakis, to $4.07 billion in 2004. In its return to the public market, Levi Strauss is adopting a dual-class share structure. Each Class A share will be entitled to one vote, while Class B shares will have 10 votes. Class B stock will primarily be held by the descendants of the company founder. That means that the Strauss's descendants will still exert big influence over the company's major decisions. Bergh said the dual-class structure was a topic of conversation during meetings with investors as the company went on the roadshow. But he said that having a strong family influence ensured that Levi's strong values would remain. \"The concept of profit through principles is a defining part of what this company is about, and it's not going to change as a publicly traded company,\" Bergh said. \"We will run this business for the long-term.\" More: Levi's Levi Strauss & Co Retail Popular", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.ap.org"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anne d'innocenzio", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "levi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "levi strauss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harmit singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chip bergh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "associated press mar", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap photo/richard drew levi strauss & co.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "factset", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T17:08:15.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "28f2d0ced4bc42c234b6f2868ea5bba1330bacf6", "url": "https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2019/4/2/us-mulling-more-sanctions-targeting-irans-economy", "site_full": "www.alaraby.co.uk", "site": "alaraby.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The New Arab ", "title": "US mulling more sanctions targeting Iran's economy", "title_full": "US mulling more sanctions targeting Iran's economy", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/file/getimagecustom/e47b51fb-a39e-4cc6-9200-db7616736b69/600/338", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9479, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 10, "comments": 8, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "28f2d0ced4bc42c234b6f2868ea5bba1330bacf6", "url": "https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2019/4/2/us-mulling-more-sanctions-targeting-irans-economy", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The New Arab", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "US mulling more sanctions targeting Iran's economy", "text": "The US is considering introducing additional sanctions on Iran to target its economy, Reuters reported this week, citing a senior official from President Donald Trump's administration.

The question was only how much they would fall. The range of blue-chip economist expectations was quite wide, from down 4 percent to down 0.5 percent, an indication of just how less predictable the economy became in the final months of 2018 and early 2019. The median expectation of economists surveyed by Econoday was 1.8 percent. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s survey had expectations at 2.1 percent.\nThe actual number beat both estimates, according to data released by the Commerce Department Tuesday. Orders for durable goods, those designed to last at least three years, fell 1.6 percent in February compared with the prior month.\nCivilian aircraft orders can be a big driver in the month-to-month volatility durable goods orders, as they were in February. Nondefense aircraft order dived 31 percent in February. The volatility comes because customers for aircraft, largely airlines, tend to make very large orders that are not spread evenly through the year.\nBecause of that high volatility, economists seeking insights into the health of the U.S. economy tend to look past the aircraft orders at a figure referred to as \u201cnondefense capital goods excluding aircraft,\u2019 which is thought to be a proxy for business investment. This fell 0.1 percent in February after an upwardly revised 0.9 percent in January.\nCompared with a year ago, this measure of business investment was up 2.6 percent in the first two months of the year. Total durable-goods orders were up 4.4% compared in the first two months compared with a year ago. These healthy year-0ver-year figures, which look back to the last comparable months before metals tariffs were announced a year ago, suggest that tariffs and trade disputes are not playing a role in holding back the economy.\nThe better-than-expected figures for February are likely to ease concerns about the possibility of a recession in 2019. The economy most likely slowed in the final two months of the 2018 and first two months of 2019 but by less than initially feared. First quarter growth is expected to come in at about 1.5 percent, with second-quarter growth projected to be more than a percentage point above that.\nThe durable goods orders for February follow the report on Monday from the Institute for Supply Management that its manufacturing index climbed by more than expected in March,\nManufacturing is an important bellwether for the economy, often indicating the trend for the rest of the U.S. economy before other sectors. It is also politically important because President Donald Trump has made the revival of the factory sector a key point of his economic program.\nWhile Tuesday\u2019s numbers do not set the kind of new records or establish multidecade highs that President Trump likes to tweet about or include in his speeches, they do indicate that some of the more dire predictions of severe slowdowns this year are unlikely to become reality.\nEconomy Politics durable goods", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-715222-1", "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/font-awesome@4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css", "https://media.brei", "https://www.googletagservices.com/tag/js/gpt.js", "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/animate.css@3.5.2/animate.min.css", "http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/Trump/d16f2385f4b94fbea81253fb710b6081/38/0"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john carney", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "econoday", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "commerce department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T17:34:47.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9bff7a3e9ff8898590b994ff64464c9224032c92", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/the-best-economy-ever-isnt-working-for-working-people/", "site_full": "www.thenation.com", "site": "thenation.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "", "title": "The \u2018Best Economy\u2019 Ever Isn\u2019t Working for Working People | The Nation", "title_full": "The \u2018Best Economy\u2019 Ever Isn\u2019t Working for Working People | The Nation", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/government-shutdown-worker-trash-rtr-img.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8081, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9bff7a3e9ff8898590b994ff64464c9224032c92", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/the-best-economy-ever-isnt-working-for-working-people/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Katrina Vanden Heuvel", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The \u2018Best Economy\u2019 Ever Isn\u2019t Working for Working People | The Nation", "text": "The \u2018Best Economy\u2019 Ever Isn\u2019t Working for Working People The \u2018Best Economy\u2019 Ever Isn\u2019t Working for Working People Trumpism has failed Americans even at the height of the recovery. sms A worker picks up trash on the National Mall near the Capitol building on January 6, 2019, during the partial government shutdown.

Powell says that the the \u201cgrowth of economic activity has slowed.\u201d The usually optimistic International Monetary Fund projects US economic growth will drop to 1.8 percent in 2020\u2014despite trillion-dollar annual deficits and the Fed putting off any more interest rate hikes for the rest of the year. If Powell and the projections are right, the long recovery that began after the Obama administration saved an economy that was in free fall is nearing its end. Yet President Trump trumpets the \u201cbest economy\u201d ever, touting low unemployment. So this is what we get at the height of recovery? This is as good as it gets? Ad Policy\nIt\u2019s true that wages have begun to rise a bit, with demand for workers and minimum-wage hikes in states and localities finally giving a boost to those on the bottom. But the average weekly pay has grown less than 1 percent per year for the decade. Low-wage workers\u2019 hourly pay in 2017 barely surpassed what they earned in 1979, while that of high-wage workers has increased nearly 50 percent. Inequality is at extremes not seen since 1928 . Workers are still not capturing a fair share of the increased productivity that they help to create.\nAnd while incomes have stagnated, key costs have soared. Health care remains remarkably expensive; millions go without insurance or are underinsured. Gallup reports that since Trump took office, the number of Americans without health insurance has increased by a stunning 7 million . Female, younger and lower-income workers have seen a greater decline than those who are male, older and/or wealthier. Life expectancy has declined for the third year in a row. The lack of health care explains part of that. The savage opioid epidemic\u2014a disease of despair\u2014accounts for another chunk.\nRead the full text of Katrina\u2019s column here .\nKatrina vanden Heuvel Twitter Katrina vanden Heuvel is editor and publisher of The Nation .\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jim young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heuvel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "people trumpism", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washingtonpost.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national mall", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T17:53:03.053+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e9ff5f4d392044aae40d5c9ed41a2011756959fe", "url": "https://article.wn.com/view/2019/04/02/US_mulling_more_sanctions_targeting_Irans_economy/", "site_full": "article.wn.com", "site": "wn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.wn.com/English/keyword/mideast", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WN.com - Mideast News", "title": "US mulling more sanctions targeting Iran's economy", "title_full": "US mulling more sanctions targeting Iran's economy - Worldnews.com", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jpAB4Lt79tM/0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5594, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e9ff5f4d392044aae40d5c9ed41a2011756959fe", "url": "https://article.wn.com/view/2019/04/02/US_mulling_more_sanctions_targeting_Irans_economy/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "wn.com", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "US mulling more sanctions targeting Iran's economy", "text": "A senior Trump administration official said the US is considering more sanctions on Iran that would be implemented around the first anniversary of Washington's withdrawal from the historic nuclear deal.. ...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T18:07:50.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b083633d6343dc8ea5e585333f141a418522ea19", "url": "https://in.investing.com/news/economy-news/lagarde-says-the-global-economy-has-lost-momentum-since-january-1518384", "site_full": "in.investing.com", "site": "investing.com", "site_section": "https://in.investing.com/news/", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Financial News - Investing.com India", "title": "Lagarde Says the Global Economy Has Lost Momentum Since January By Bloomberg", "title_full": "Lagarde Says the Global Economy Has Lost Momentum Since January By Bloomberg", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picc5c855d8b20a6407c39186b059351048.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 699, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b083633d6343dc8ea5e585333f141a418522ea19", "url": "https://in.investing.com/news/economy-news/lagarde-says-the-global-economy-has-lost-momentum-since-january-1518384", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bloomberg", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Lagarde Says the Global Economy Has Lost Momentum Since January By Bloomberg", "text": "\u00a9 Bloomberg. Christine Lagarde Photographer: Justin Chin/Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Global growth has lost momentum since the start of the year, leaving the world economy in a \u201cprecarious\u201d position, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said.\nThe global economy has weakened since the International Monetary Fund last updated its forecast in late January, though a recession isn\u2019t likely in the near term, Lagarde said Tuesday in remarks prepared for a speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington.\nIn January, the fund lowered its projection for world economic growth, forecasting expansion of 3.5 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2020. It was the IMF\u2019s second cut in the outlook in three months. The fund will release its new World Economic Outlook with an updated growth forecast on April 9.\n\u201cThe global economy is at a \u2018delicate moment,\u2019\u201d Lagarde said.\nHer warning comes as global finance ministers and central bankers prepare to convene in Washington next week for the semi-annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank. While confidence has been boosted by the Federal Reserve\u2019s switch to a more patient stance and signs of a trade deal between the U.S. and China, investors remain concerned the global expansion may be running out of steam a decade after the financial crisis.\nRate Patience\nLagarde said the global economy is set to benefit from the patience of major central banks, as well as increased stimulus by the Chinese government. The IMF predicts global growth will pick up \u201csome\u201d in the second half of 2019 and into 2020, she said.\nStill, that rebound remains vulnerable to a host of risks, including Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, high debt in some sectors and countries, trade tensions and \u201ca sense of unease in financial markets,\u201d Lagarde said.\nGiven the state of the global economy, it\u2019s important for policy makers to avoid missteps, she said. Monetary policy should remain accommodative where inflation is below target, while exchange-rate flexibility should be used as needed, according to Lagarde. Regulatory reforms aimed at strengthening the financial sector should continue, she added.\nHigh public debt and low interest rates have left \u201climited room to act when the next downturn comes, which inevitably it will,\u201d she said. \u201cFor many countries, this implies making smarter use of fiscal policy.\u201d\nThe market power of corporations has been increasing, with the highest price markups being imposed by a \u201csmall number of highly dynamic companies,\u201d a trend that is especially pronounced in the digital economy, Lagarde said.\nMarket Power\n\u201cI am not saying that we currently have a \u2018monopoly problem.\u2019 But I am saying that we should take appropriate measures -- so that it does not become a problem,\u201d she said.\nLagarde reiterated her warning for countries to avoid imposing new tariffs on each other. An increase in tariffs by 25 percentage points on all goods traded between the U.S. and China would reduce annual output in the U.S. by up to 0.6 percent, and up to 1.5 percent in China, she said.\n\u201cThese are potentially self-inflicted wounds that should be avoided,\u201d Lagarde said.\nHigh-level trade talks between the U.S. and China resume this week in Washington amid hopes the world\u2019s two biggest economies can reach a deal to end their trade war.\nLagarde Says the Global Economy Has Lost Momentum Since January", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=179222828858436&u=https%3A%2F%2Fin.investing.com%2Fnews%2Feconomy-news%2Flagarde-says-the-global-economy-has-lost-momentum-since-january-1518384&display=popup&ref=plugin", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fin.investing.com%2Fnews%2Feconomy-news%2Flagarde-says-the-global-economy-has-lost-momentum-since-january-1518384&title=Lagarde+Says+the+Global+Economy+Has+Lost+Momentum+Since+January&summary=", "https://invst.ly/afxv7"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lagarde", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "justin chin/bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "christine lagarde", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg \u00a9 bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "imf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international monetary fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. chamber of commerce", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T18:11:42.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "85bf36f4b26c2418077c22ff629aa3d2f97445fd", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/all-the-reasons-to-fret-about-global-economy-in-10-charts/articleshow/68691975.cms", "site_full": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/markets/stocks/markets/stocks/news/rssfeeds/2146843.cms", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "News-Stocks-Markets-Economic Times", "title": "global economy: All the reasons to fret about global economy in 10 charts", "title_full": "global economy: All the reasons to fret about global economy in 10 charts - The Economic Times", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-68691964,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1005986,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "85bf36f4b26c2418077c22ff629aa3d2f97445fd", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/all-the-reasons-to-fret-about-global-economy-in-10-charts/articleshow/68691975.cms", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "indiatimes.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "global economy: All the reasons to fret about global economy in 10 charts", "text": "By Michelle Jamrisko\nThe global economy is wobbling in 2019, giving rise to recession fears and forcing the world\u2019s central banks to consider renewed policy easing.\nThe stresses have prompted repeated forecast downgrades by governments and other authorities. On Tuesday, the World Trade Organization slashed its 2019 trade projection to the weakest in three years. The OECD cut its economic forecast last month and warned of downside risks that could mean an even worse outcome.\nAcross trade, equities, currencies and interest rates, here are a few reasons analysts are worried about the global economic outlook:\n1. Trade\nU.S.-China trade talks sputter on, without any clear sign of resolution. The Chinese economy has been a difficult one to pin down, sliding more than expected and then improving in fits and starts. That\u2019s feeding into a broader malaise in global demand, which has shown up in the form of dramatically slower trade flows.\nWhile quarterly data show a frightening drop at the start of 2019, a more timely Bloomberg Economics dashboard of 10 critical gauges has pointed to ongoing weakness. German companies\u2019 sentiment showed a glint of hope in March after six straight declines.\nAnd the pain is felt acutely in Asia, home to some of the world\u2019s most export-reliant economies. Purchasing manager indexes across the continent are only starting to show hints of a China-led rebound after several months of souring..\n2. Policy Uncertainty\nTrade talks and the tariff wars have fed into the guessing game around how politics and policy will interfere with the fundamentals. Also in the mix are Brexit, a spate of elections -- some of them messy, like Thailand -- and the sharp turn in the global monetary policy cycle. China\u2019s policy uncertainty has been especially pronounced as analysts try to pick apart how officials will manage the slowdown there.\nIn the U.K., Brexit has become the weight that won\u2019t go away, still holding back capital spending and broader economic growth, as London-based Bloomberg Economics economist Dan Hanson shows. The British Chambers of Commerce said this week that investment intentions are at the lowest in eight years as firms refuse to commit to projects in such an uncertain backdrop.\n3. Financial Conditions\nThe financial markets have taken some of the developments in stride, while still showing signs of stress.\nIt\u2019ll be a gauge to keep an eye on, but for now, the Bloomberg U.S. Financial Conditions Index -- which measures the overall level of financial stress in money, bond and equity markets -- is at least looking better than it did since touching a 2 1/2-year low in December. A positive value in that measure indicates accommodative financial conditions, while a negative value indicates tighter financial conditions relative to pre-crisis norms.\n4. Dollar Strength\nEmerging-market officials especially are attuned to any durable signs that the greenback will return to the strengthening path that added a lot of pressure in 2018. The dollar remains in a relatively stronger band against a basket of major currencies, particularly compared with its position a year ago.\n5. Economic Surprises\nAdding to the gloomy hard data is the fact that analysts just haven\u2019t been very good at forecasting recently. Releases have been surprising on the negative side more often -- across the U.S., Europe and Asia-Pacific.\nIt\u2019s even more concerning when you consider economists\u2019 terrible record on predicting recessions.\n6. Low-flation\nSince Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell branded it \u201cone of the major challenges of our time,\u201d stubbornly low inflation has garnered even more attention around the world. Despite unprecedented monetary support, central bankers have been constantly frustrated in their attempts to generate sustainable price growth.\n7. Debt\nWhile debt worries might vary by economy, one area getting extra attention lately -- including from former Fed chief Janet Yellen -- is the U.S. leveraged loan market.

But the market is also rising because punters and pundits are assuming the soft spot in economic expansion has ended, and growth is already resuming globally. The positive data out of China is taken as proof-positive of this resumption of expansion.\nNow wait a minute--the market is rising because growth is softening and also because growth has resumed? Sorry Stock Market, you can't have it both ways. Either the global economy is stagnating, forcing central banks to flood the financial system with more liquidity, or growth is resuming, in which case raising interest rates are back on the table, especially if wage inflation kicks in.\nIf growth resumes, not only will the Fed have a green light to raise rates, it will also face pressure to resume trimming its bloated balance sheet.\nMany observers have noted that the sharp decline in Treasury bond yields is signaling fear that the global economy is recessionary, and central bank goosing isn't going to reverse the slowdown. Meanwhile, stocks are schizophrenic: going up because growth is slowing and Fed rate cuts are now in the bag and going up because growth has resumed.\nCentral bank and financial authorities are keen to continue the schizophrenia because markets have no excuse to drop: if growth has stagnated, markets will continue soaring, and if growth has resumed, markets can continue in overdrive.\nEventually reality will intrude in this pleasant madness: either the global economy slips into recession and corporate profits tank, kicking out the props of high stock valuations, or global growth resumes, opening the door to stock-market-killing rate increases and balance sheet reductions.\nHere's one way to visualize this moment in history: global financial markets are in the eye of a very large hurricane:\n* * *", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "charles hugh smith", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the fed", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T18:46:32.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7c8429d7956fec8fdcb9070e0623df878ca2e04e", "url": "https://au.investing.com/news/economy-news/lagarde-says-the-global-economy-has-lost-momentum-since-january-1420500", "site_full": "au.investing.com", "site": "investing.com", "site_section": "https://au.investing.com/", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Investing.com Australia - Financial News, Stock Quotes &amp; Charts", "title": "Lagarde Says the Global Economy Has Lost Momentum Since January By Bloomberg", "title_full": "Lagarde Says the Global Economy Has Lost Momentum Since January By Bloomberg", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picc5c855d8b20a6407c39186b059351048.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 699, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7c8429d7956fec8fdcb9070e0623df878ca2e04e", "url": "https://au.investing.com/news/economy-news/lagarde-says-the-global-economy-has-lost-momentum-since-january-1420500", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bloomberg", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Lagarde Says the Global Economy Has Lost Momentum Since January By Bloomberg", "text": "\u00a9 Bloomberg. Christine Lagarde Photographer: Justin Chin/Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Global growth has lost momentum since the start of the year, leaving the world economy in a \u201cprecarious\u201d position, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said.\nThe global economy has weakened since the International Monetary Fund last updated its forecast in late January, though a recession isn\u2019t likely in the near term, Lagarde said Tuesday in remarks prepared for a speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington.\nIn January, the fund lowered its projection for world economic growth, forecasting expansion of 3.5 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2020. It was the IMF\u2019s second cut in the outlook in three months. The fund will release its new World Economic Outlook with an updated growth forecast on April 9.\n\u201cThe global economy is at a \u2018delicate moment,\u2019\u201d Lagarde said.\nHer warning comes as global finance ministers and central bankers prepare to convene in Washington next week for the semi-annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank. While confidence has been boosted by the Federal Reserve\u2019s switch to a more patient stance and signs of a trade deal between the U.S. and China, investors remain concerned the global expansion may be running out of steam a decade after the financial crisis.\nRate Patience\nLagarde said the global economy is set to benefit from the patience of major central banks, as well as increased stimulus by the Chinese government. The IMF predicts global growth will pick up \u201csome\u201d in the second half of 2019 and into 2020, she said.\nStill, that rebound remains vulnerable to a host of risks, including Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, high debt in some sectors and countries, trade tensions and \u201ca sense of unease in financial markets,\u201d Lagarde said.\nGiven the state of the global economy, it\u2019s important for policy makers to avoid missteps, she said. Monetary policy should remain accommodative where inflation is below target, while exchange-rate flexibility should be used as needed, according to Lagarde. Regulatory reforms aimed at strengthening the financial sector should continue, she added.\nHigh public debt and low interest rates have left \u201climited room to act when the next downturn comes, which inevitably it will,\u201d she said. \u201cFor many countries, this implies making smarter use of fiscal policy.\u201d\nThe market power of corporations has been increasing, with the highest price markups being imposed by a \u201csmall number of highly dynamic companies,\u201d a trend that is especially pronounced in the digital economy, Lagarde said.\nMarket Power\n\u201cI am not saying that we currently have a \u2018monopoly problem.\u2019 But I am saying that we should take appropriate measures -- so that it does not become a problem,\u201d she said.\nLagarde reiterated her warning for countries to avoid imposing new tariffs on each other. An increase in tariffs by 25 percentage points on all goods traded between the U.S. and China would reduce annual output in the U.S. by up to 0.6 percent, and up to 1.5 percent in China, she said.\n\u201cThese are potentially self-inflicted wounds that should be avoided,\u201d Lagarde said.\nHigh-level trade talks between the U.S. and China resume this week in Washington amid hopes the world\u2019s two biggest economies can reach a deal to end their trade war.\nLagarde Says the Global Economy Has Lost Momentum Since January", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=179222828858436&u=https%3A%2F%2Fau.investing.com%2Fnews%2Feconomy-news%2Flagarde-says-the-global-economy-has-lost-momentum-since-january-1420500&display=popup&ref=plugin", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fau.investing.com%2Fnews%2Feconomy-news%2Flagarde-says-the-global-economy-has-lost-momentum-since-january-1420500&title=Lagarde+Says+the+Global+Economy+Has+Lost+Momentum+Since+January&summary=", "https://invst.ly/afy0y"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lagarde", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "justin chin/bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "christine lagarde", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg \u00a9 bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "imf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international monetary fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. chamber of commerce", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T18:49:51.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "613e0d3c2a3018f809823b518f04efc7309921ca", "url": "https://article.wn.com/view/2019/04/02/IMF_managing_director_says_economy_at_delicate_moment_r/", "site_full": "article.wn.com", "site": "wn.com", "site_section": "https://wn.com/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "World News", "title": "IMF managing director says economy at 'delicate moment'", "title_full": "IMF managing director says economy at 'delicate moment' - Worldnews.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MhrC2_Hak08/0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5594, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "613e0d3c2a3018f809823b518f04efc7309921ca", "url": "https://article.wn.com/view/2019/04/02/IMF_managing_director_says_economy_at_delicate_moment_r/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "wn.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "IMF managing director says economy at 'delicate moment'", "text": "Advertisement\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The head of the International Monetary Fund says the global economy is at a \"delicate moment\" with a hoped-for rebound in growth later this year being threatened by a variety of factors from such as rising trade tensions.\nIMF Managing Director", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "imf", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "international monetary fund", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T18:53:52.035+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "44ddcd7a78ccbb619b2e02ff09e567ae936b001b", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/04/02/stock-market-news-walgreens-weighs-on-the-dow-slac.aspx", "site_full": "www.fool.com", "site": "fool.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Stock Market News: Walgreens Weighs on the Dow;

Slack Goes Direct With NYSE -- The Motley Fool", "text": "Stock Market News: Walgreens Weighs on the Dow; Slack Goes Direct With NYSE April 02, 2019, 11:22:54 AM EDT By Dan Caplinger, Motley Fool\nTuesday got off to a sluggish start on Wall Street, as market participants reined in the enthusiasm that produced healthy gains on Monday. Worries about the U.K.'s potential exit from the European Union weighed against signs of a stronger economy in China. As of 11:12 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) was down 129 points to 26,133. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) fell 7 points to 2,860, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) dropped 14 points to 7,814.\nOne of the newest members of the Dow is Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) , and the drugstore chain's latest quarterly results had a pronounced influence on that illustrious benchmark this morning. Meanwhile, privately held workplace messaging specialist Slack Technologies looks like it's made a decision about where it expects to list its shares once it goes public -- although it's taking a page from the playbook of music-streaming company Spotify (NYSE: SPOT) in how it's doing so. Walgreens looks a little ill\nShares of Walgreens Boots Alliance were down 12% after the drugstore chain gian t report ed its fiscal second-quarter financial results. Walgreens said that its sales for the quarter were up almost 5% from the year-ago period, but the company's bottom line went in the wrong direction. Adjusted operating income was down more than 10%, and a 5% drop in earnings per share was far worse than the modest gain that most of those following the stock were expecting to see.\nImage source: Walgreens.\nCEO Stefano Pessina didn't pull any punches, calling the period \"the most difficult quarter we have had since the formation of Walgreens Boots Alliance.\" Pessina pointed to pressure on reimbursement rates for prescriptions, generic pricing, and weakness from consumers in both the U.S. and U.K. markets.\nAs a result of the weakness, Walgreens cut its earnings guidance for the full fiscal year. The drugstore giant now expects flat adjusted earnings for the year, down from its previous projection for growth of 7% to 12%.\nIn response, Walgreens plans to redouble its efforts to reduce costs over the next several years. In addition, the company will work on transforming its retail locations with what it calls \"in-store neighborhood health destinations\" designed to draw more traffic. Walgreens hopes that those measures will yield better results in fiscal 2020, but even though the shares have looked relatively cheap for some time , investors weren't in a mood to be patient today. Slack heads for the NYSE\nSlack Technologies has been one of the most highly anticipated IPOs of the year , and many investors are looking forward to having a chance to invest in the fast-growing workplace messaging specialist. It now appears that when they get their chance, it'll be through a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange.\nDirect listings differ from traditional IPOs in the process that they follow. With most IPOs, Wall Street financial companies act as underwriters, finding investors who are willing to participate in the offering by buying shares. The sale of those shares happens immediately before the stock begins trading on public stock markets. By contrast, with a direct listing, the company itself sells shares directly to the public on the stock exchange.\nSlack isn't the first company to go this route. Last year, Spotify did a direct listing on the NYSE, and although the share price has had its ups and downs since, most participants seemed to be happy with how the process went.\nMost of those following Slack believe that the offering will take place around the beginning of summer. That gives investors some time to look more closely at Slack's business and whether they want to own a piece of it.\n10 stocks we like better than Walgreens Boots Alliance When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It's vitally important,\" Lagarde said.\nShe added that based on IMF research, if a 25 percent tariff increase was imposed, it would lead to a 0.6 percent loss of U.S. economic growth and a 1.5 percent loss for the Chinese economy.\n\"Given that those are the two big giants currently, if you have that kind of negative impact on both, it would weigh heavily on the global economy and it would be bad,\" Lagarde said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chri", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kazuhiro nogi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lagarde", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sara eisen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine lagarde", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "imf", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "afp | getty images international monetary fund", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tokyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington, dc", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T19:22:16.060+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7ee798cdc97a940dd8954199126f72c5f2b1baf9", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/retiring-baby-boomers-mean-economy-170012362.html", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://finance.yahoo.com/", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo Finance - Business Finance, Stock Market, Quotes, News", "title": "What Retiring Baby Boomers Mean for the Economy", "title_full": "What Retiring Baby Boomers Mean for the Economy", "published": "2019-04-02T01:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4.WsPvRdeZX.pop5AI2QTw--~B/aD00MDA7dz03Mjg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/smartasset_475/4532447799f249118b03f0e6040af1e5", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 7, "comments": 7, "shares": 21}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7ee798cdc97a940dd8954199126f72c5f2b1baf9", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/retiring-baby-boomers-mean-economy-170012362.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "SmartAsset", "published": "2019-04-02T01:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "What Retiring Baby Boomers Mean for the Economy", "text": "baby boomers retiring More Almost 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 every day. The famed generation, defined as those born between 1946 and 1964, is causing something of a stir as they reach retirement age in droves. In 2031, the U.S. population over the age of 65 will number 75 million, almost double what it was just 23 years prior in 2008. A generation of this size transitioning out of the workforce will naturally affect the economy in many ways.\nHow Retiring Baby Boomers Affect Social Security\nIn 2008 the first baby boomers reached age 62, which is the earliest you can elect for Social Security retirement benefits. The last of them will reach full retirement age in 2031. At that point, there will be approximately 75 million people over the age of 65 in the U.S. That\u2019s a lot of retirees drawing on Social Security.\nAs more and more boomers elect to begin receiving Social Security benefits, many people can\u2019t help but adopt a fatalistic view of the financial health of the fund. With the majority of boomers likely collecting for roughly two decades, it seems as if a fund shortage is a matter of when, rather than if. Indeed, a 2015 report from the Social Security Administration (SSA) states that the OASDI trust is projected to run out in 2033 if no adjustments are made. When it runs out, the SSA projects that tax revenue will be able to foot the bill for 77% of benefits.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that Social Security is likely to go bankrupt. We\u2019ve been in this situation before, with the country staring down a Social Security funding shortfall in the 1980s. Congress took action, raising the full retirement age to 67 and implementing taxes on benefits. Expect congress to act again before it\u2019s too late. That could mean raising the cap on OASDI taxes (which currently only apply to income below $128,400); it could mean raising the retirement age once again; it might even mean changing how we calculate cost-of-living adjustments .\nIn other words, Social Security isn\u2019t going away, but it\u2019s likely to see some changes in the years to come.\nHow Retiring Baby Boomers Affect the Job Market\nbaby boomers retiring More Predicting the baby boomers\u2019 impact on the job market is a tricky task. With each day bringing thousands of boomers to retirement age, many are indeed leaving the job market behind and freeing up jobs. However, many baby boomers aren\u2019t retiring at 65. Plenty are transitioning to a part-time arrangement with their companies, and some are working into their 70s.\nThere are a few different possible explanations for this phenomenon. One is that many boomers haven\u2019t saved up enough money to afford maintaining their lifestyle in retirement. So, their solution is to just not retire. Related to this is that the average life expectancy continues to rise. Not only does this mean more retirement to save for, but many Boomers may prefer to spend a few more years working than embark on a retirement that lasts 20 years and beyond.\nForecasting how many boomers retire at their full retirement age and how many continue to work can be difficult. It\u2019s important to keep in mind, though, that Social Security benefits max out at age 70 \u2013 a milestone that the first boomers have begun to hit. With less incentive to keep working at this point, more boomers will be leaving the workforce for good.\nHow Retiring Baby Boomers Affect Consumer Spending\nA report from the Stanford Center on Longevity states that almost one third of baby boomers had no retirement account as of 2014. This means that millions of people are approaching retirement without any savings to speak of. A popular rule of thumb is that you\u2019ll need about 80% of your pre-retirement income to maintain your current lifestyle. Unfortunately, Social Security benefits supply only about half of that if you\u2019re an average earner. If you don\u2019t have any savings, you\u2019re going to need to seriously cut back on spending.\nThat means an overall decrease in consumer spending, which is a significant component of GDP. A decrease in spending means a decrease in consumer demand for products and services. In turn, that means a decrease in revenue for businesses and a hit to the overall health of the economy. Expect the growth rate of the American economy to slow in the years to come as millions leave the workforce and find themselves with less money to spend.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://smartasset.com/retirement/401k-calculator&quot;", "https://smartasset.com/retirement/full-retirement-age", "https://smartasset.com/retirement/retirement-calculator&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Xs.d.CCRlDeYVBzNvPgKUA--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzI4O2g9NDAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/smartasset_475/0b24ccbcae893a72cc43b309dd92eb19", "https://smartasset.com/retirement/whats-up-with-social-security-cola", "https://smartasset.com/retirement/whats-up-with-social-security-cola&quot;", "http://longevity.stanford.edu/sightlines-financial-security-special-report-mobile/", "https://smartasset.com/retirement/retirement-calculator", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Xs.d.CCRlDeYVBzNvPgKUA--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzI4O2g9NDAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/smartasset_475/0b24ccbcae893a72cc43b309dd92eb19);", "https://smartasset.com/taxes/social-security-tax&quot;", "https://smartasset.com/retirement/social-security-calculator", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TTwCjgEpvBbtjOnEfMjUCw--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzI4O2g9NDAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/smartasset_475/b4fa6239e81d9152ed8e298d53f2fa56", "https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v75n1/v75n1p1.html&quot;", "http://longevity.stanford.edu/sightlines-financial-security-special-report-mobile/&quot;", "https://smartasset.com/retirement/full-retirement-age&quot;", "https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v75n1/v75n1p1.html", "https://smartasset.com/retirement/401k-calculator", "https://smartasset.com/taxes/social-security-tax", "https://smartasset.com/retirement/social-security-calculator&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "social security", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T19:22:50.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a7649faf6849d8a66bab56d52d328926d5996139", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/2019/04/02/stock-market-news-walgreens-weighs-on-the-dow-slac.aspx", "site_full": "www.fool.com", "site": "fool.com", "site_section": "http://www.fool.com/investing-news/", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "Motley Fool News &amp; Analysis -- The Motley Fool ", "title": "Stock Market News: Walgreens Weighs on the Dow; Slack Goes Direct With NYSE", "title_full": "Stock Market News: Walgreens Weighs on the Dow; Slack Goes Direct With NYSE -- The Motley Fool", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.987, "main_image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/517918/wba-store.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1336, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a7649faf6849d8a66bab56d52d328926d5996139", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/2019/04/02/stock-market-news-walgreens-weighs-on-the-dow-slac.aspx", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dan Caplinger", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Stock Market News: Walgreens Weighs on the Dow; Slack Goes Direct With NYSE", "text": "Tuesday got off to a sluggish start on Wall Street, as market participants reined in the enthusiasm that produced healthy gains on Monday. Worries about the U.K.'s potential exit from the European Union weighed against signs of a stronger economy in China. As of 11:12 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJINDICES:^DJI ) was down 129 points to 26,133. The S&P 500 ( SNPINDEX:^GSPC ) fell 7 points to 2,860, and the Nasdaq Composite ( NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC ) dropped 14 points to 7,814.\nOne of the newest members of the Dow is Walgreens Boots Alliance ( NASDAQ:WBA ) , and the drugstore chain's latest quarterly results had a pronounced influence on that illustrious benchmark this morning. Meanwhile, privately held workplace messaging specialist Slack Technologies looks like it's made a decision about where it expects to list its shares once it goes public -- although it's taking a page from the playbook of music-streaming company Spotify ( NYSE:SPOT ) in how it's doing so.\nWalgreens looks a little ill Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance were down 12% after the drugstore chain giant reported its fiscal second-quarter financial results. Walgreens said that its sales for the quarter were up almost 5% from the year-ago period, but the company's bottom line went in the wrong direction. Adjusted operating income was down more than 10%, and a 5% drop in earnings per share was far worse than the modest gain that most of those following the stock were expecting to see.\nImage source: Walgreens.\nCEO Stefano Pessina didn't pull any punches, calling the period \"the most difficult quarter we have had since the formation of Walgreens Boots Alliance.\" Pessina pointed to pressure on reimbursement rates for prescriptions, generic pricing, and weakness from consumers in both the U.S. and U.K. markets.\nAs a result of the weakness, Walgreens cut its earnings guidance for the full fiscal year. The drugstore giant now expects flat adjusted earnings for the year, down from its previous projection for growth of 7% to 12%.\nIn response, Walgreens plans to redouble its efforts to reduce costs over the next several years. In addition, the company will work on transforming its retail locations with what it calls \"in-store neighborhood health destinations\" designed to draw more traffic. Walgreens hopes that those measures will yield better results in fiscal 2020, but even though the shares have looked relatively cheap for some time , investors weren't in a mood to be patient today.\nSlack heads for the NYSE Slack Technologies has been one of the most highly anticipated IPOs of the year , and many investors are looking forward to having a chance to invest in the fast-growing workplace messaging specialist. It now appears that when they get their chance, it'll be through a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange.\nDirect listings differ from traditional IPOs in the process that they follow. With most IPOs, Wall Street financial companies act as underwriters, finding investors who are willing to participate in the offering by buying shares. The sale of those shares happens immediately before the stock begins trading on public stock markets. By contrast, with a direct listing, the company itself sells shares directly to the public on the stock exchange.\nSlack isn't the first company to go this route. Last year, Spotify did a direct listing on the NYSE, and although the share price has had its ups and downs since, most participants seemed to be happy with how the process went.\nMost of those following Slack believe that the offering will take place around the beginning of summer. That gives investors some time to look more closely at Slack's business and whether they want to own a piece of it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "walgreens", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walgreens boots alliance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spotify", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gspc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wall street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T19:40:31.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "73911ab8eb477d1656456f95e6ecf1bdc3815e12", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gold-prices-virtually-unchanged-as-stock-market-bulls-take-a-breather-2019-04-02", "site_full": "www.marketwatch.com", "site": "marketwatch.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Gold prices virtually unchanged as stock-market bulls take a breather - MarketWatch", "title_full": "Gold prices virtually unchanged as stock-market bulls take a breather - MarketWatch", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GX379_goldpi_ZG_20181031073336.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 900, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 8}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "73911ab8eb477d1656456f95e6ecf1bdc3815e12", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gold-prices-virtually-unchanged-as-stock-market-bulls-take-a-breather-2019-04-02", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "William Watts", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Gold prices virtually unchanged as stock-market bulls take a breather - MarketWatch", "text": "William Watts Deputy markets editor\nGold futures finished slightly higher Tuesday a day after coming under pressure following a round of upbeat data on manufacturing activity out of China and the U.S. that sparked a rally in stocks and other assets perceived as risky and robbed haven assets of their appeal.\nGold for June delivery GCM9, -0.08% on Comex picked up $1.20, or less than 0.1%, to settle at $1,295.40 an ounce, while May silver SIK9, +0.29% gave up 3.8 cents, or 0.3%, to end at $15.061 an ounce.\nStocks benchmarks came under selling pressure after major indexes logged sharp gains following purchasing managers index readings out of China that showed manufacturing activity stabilizing and a stronger-than-expected reading in the Institute for Supply Managements\u2019s U.S. manufacturing index.\nOn Tuesday, a reading of orders for long-lasting goods fell in February for the first time in four months and business investment continued to soften, reflecting a slower U.S. economy early in the new year.\nDurable-goods orders sank 1.6% , compared with consensus economists estimates polled by MarketWatch for a decline of 2.1%, largely because of fewer bookings for commercial aircraft and defense-related hardware, the Commerce Department said.\n\u201cWhile gold has the potential to sink further in the near term, the medium to longer term outlook remains in favor of bulls,\u201d said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, in a note.\n\u201cGeopolitical risks in the form of Brexit, uncertainty over U.S.-China trade talks and a dovish Federal Reserve are likely to continue supporting gold,\u201d he said.\nOtunuga said gold is likely to test support near $1,280 in the near term, while a break back above the $1,300 level is needed to persuade bulls to \u201cjump back into the game.\u201d\nIn other metals trade, June palladium PAM9, -1.63% advanced $8.50, or 0.6%, to end at $1,400.30 an ounce, while July platinum PLN9, +2.50% edged $2.80 cents, or 0.3%, to settle at $852.50 an ounce.\nMay copper HGK9, +1.29% was off 1.90 cents, or 0.6%, to finish at $2.9055 a pound.\nWant news about Europe delivered to your inbox?

After a cataclysmic summer, in which the Turkish lira fell to nearly seven to the US dollar, the lira had recovered to just over five to the US dollar by the end of January this year.\nNow though, the worries are back and a number of factors have contributed to that.\nFirstly, inflation has remained stubbornly high, partly because the weaker lira has pushed up the cost of imported food, while poor weather and flooding towards the end of last year and in January pushed up the price of fresh fruit and vegetables.\nInflation stayed above 20% and, in food, was pushing 30% by January - although the headline rate of inflation slipped back below 20% in February. Sentiment also took a knock when it was confirmed in early March that, after the Turkish economy contracted at an annual rate of 3% during the final three months of 2018, the previously fast-growing country had entered a technical recession for the first time since 2008-09.\nImage: The weak Turkish lira is beneficial for exporters and foreign tourists It was to this unpromising backdrop - a recession, rising unemployment, stubbornly high inflation and business confidence plunging - that Mr Erdogan entered a local election campaign that promised to be his toughest test at the polls since he first became prime minister in 2003 and president in 2014.\nOn the campaign trail, Mr Erdogan lashed out at what he called \"speculators\", accusing them of selling the lira.\nThis was followed by news, last week, that the authorities appeared to be trying to prevent further falls in the lira.\nInvestors cracked down on \"short sellers\" - investors selling lira they did not own in order to buy it back at a profit after it had fallen on foreign currency markets - by stopping local banks from lending lira to foreign borrowers.\nExtraordinarily, by Wednesday last week, the overnight swap rate in Turkish lira, a measure of how much it costs to borrow the currency, had jumped 1,200% - making it almost impossible for foreign speculators to bet against the currency.\nBut this only leached away at confidence and prompted a fall of more than 5% in the main Turkish stock index the next day.\nThe cost of insuring against a default in Turkish government debt also shot up and, despite the restrictions, the Turkish lira continued to fall.\nFigures published towards the end of last week revealed that, during March alone, the Turkish central bank had got through nearly a third of its foreign currency reserves trying to prop up the value of the lira.\nIronically, much of the more recent selling appears not to have been by speculators on the international currency markets, but by ordinary Turkish families seeking to protect the value of their savings by buying dollars and euros.\nNot that the heavy-handedness of the authorities did Mr Erdogan any good. His ruling AK Party suffered a number of electoral setbacks, including the capital, Ankara, as well as Istanbul, controlled by parties linked to Mr Erdogan since he became the city's mayor 25 years ago.\nThe concern for investors now will be that Mr Erdogan engages in short-term fixes in an attempt to rebuild his popularity rather than embark on the reforms needed to improve the Turkish economy's competitiveness over the longer term.\nGovernment debt is relatively low but there are still high levels of debt in the private sector, particularly among the banks, with loans to foreign creditors of almost $180bn (\u00a3137bn) due for repayment this year.\nEconomists have been downgrading their forecasts in anticipation of things getting worse before they get better.\nGoldman Sachs, which was previously forecasting that the Turkish economy would contract by 2.5% this year, warned on Monday there was a risk that the deterioration turned out to be worse than that.\nAnd, ominously, diplomatic relations with the US also appear to be under strain once again. The US today halted delivery of equipment needed for the new F-35 stealth fighter jets Turkey is buying from American defence giant Lockheed Martin. The move is in response to Mr Erdogan's refusal to abandon an order for a Russian-built missile defence system.\nThat was enough to put the Turkish lira on the skids again. It has fallen by more than 2% against the US dollar today and has now fallen by 7% since last Wednesday against the greenback.\nThe Turkish central bank is expected to raise interest rates again later this month.

Published Just now\nAs the overwhelming majority of hip-hop publicly grieves the devastating fate of one of its most cherished, L.A.\u2019s rap noble Nipsey Hussle , there are still some of his closest industry counterparts who have chosen to mourn privately.\nFor now, Queens hip-hop heavyweight 50 Cent is one of them, which he bluntly enlightened a fan of via Instagram. The probing commenter apparently found it odd that among Fif\u2019s several posts, he\u2019d not yet addressed Nipsey\u2019s death, leaving her to question whether he knew the Victory Lap rapper. In only the bluntest way Fif\u2019s Instagram followers might expect him to, he informed her that he did know Nipsey, but wouldn\u2019t let her nor anyone else pressure him into speaking out on the passing before he\u2019s ready to. 'Yeah I know Nipsey b**ch,' he replied to the fan...\n\"I'll say something when I'm ready. Get the f**k outta here.\" A post shared by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom) on Apr 1, 2019 at 6:29pm PDT\nOn the contrary, several others have been vocal about their devastation following Nipsey's death, such as another West Coast rap luminary, Game. Taking a night drive through Nipsey's Slauson neighborhood, the Born to Rap artist emotionally broke down while speaking on his crushing fate.

It was unusual because normally credit leads equities. This was one where equities led the massive deterioration in credit,\" said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis. \"The spigot turned off.\"\nIndeed, the late-year meltdown and its carry-through to the market in the early part of the year was severe.\nIssuance plummeted across the board, from syndicated loans to mergers and acquisitions to institutional lending. Securitized products such as collateralized loan obligations also saw a huge drop in activity as did leveraged buyouts, according to data compiled by Refinitiv.\nFirst-quarter syndicated lending overall declined 36 percent to about $400 billion. Leveraged loans , a previously surging part of the market involving highly indebted companies with weak credit profiles, fell 56 percent to $152 billion.

The massive 52 room mansion of the rapper who will henceforth be known as \u201c 16 cents on the dollar\u201d sold for just $2.9 million.\nBut wait, it gets better.\nThe rapper, Curtis James Jackson III, originally purchased the property from former boxer Mike Tyson for $4.1 million in 2003, the year that Tyson himself filed for bankruptcy. At the time, the sale set a record for the \u201cmost expensive home ever sold\u201d in Farmington, a town about 80 miles north of Greenwich, according to the Wall Street Journal .\nWhen Jackson went to sell the 52 room mansion in 2007, it was listed for $4.99 million. There was also an offer to rent the mansion for $100,000 a month. Listing photos show the mansion\u2019s basketball court with a G-Unit logo at center court and a night club decorated with murals of 50 Cent.\nThe home also sports game rooms, a recording studio, a home theater, an indoor pool and a conference center. It was costing about $70,000 per month to carry, including mortgage payments and taxes. Jackson managed to hold on to the house despite his filing for bankruptcy several years ago. He also seemed to find the humor in not being able to sell the mansion.\nIn 2017, after an attempted robbery at the house, he wrote in a now deleted Instagram post:\n\u201cWhat my house got robbed, I thought I sold that MF. LOL.\u201d\nJackson also joked about owning such a large home on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert earlier this year. On the show, he said:\n\u201cYou know when you look down the hallway in your house and you don\u2019t wanna go down there? Things would break because you didn\u2019t use it. You didn\u2019t turn it on, now the light is flickering.\u201d\nThe white elephant home became a \u201csideshow of a sale\u201d after staying on the market so long. One broker described it as \u201can outlier that has nothing to do with the state of any housing market in Connecticut.\u201d\nThe median list price per square foot in CT is $173, which would price Jackson\u2019s mansion at around $8.65 million.\nIf not anything else, Jackson\u2019s inability to sell a mansion during the longest and most \u201cprosperous\u201d bull market in history should give him enough gravitas to make the switch from late night TV appearances to financial news media.\nWe look forward to him joining rapper Pitbull as a guest on CNBC commenting about his investing strategies for Bitcoin, pot stocks, the Lyft IPO or the real estate market.\nThe article, \"Sell Low Or Die Tryin' - 50 Cent \"Massacred\" With 84% Price Cut On Connecticut Mansion\", was syndicated from and first appeared at: http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/_Fl9IRHBzjs/sell-low-or-die-tryin-50-cent-takes-massive-84-price-cut-52-room-connecticut.\nYou may find more great articles by Tyler Durden on http://www.zerohedge.com/fullrss2.xml/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/draghi/CBO%20August%201.png/%2A%7CFORWARD%7C%2A.

Clary | AFP | GettyImages\nAccording to PayScale's recently released State of the Gender Pay Gap in 2019 report, women on average earn 79 cents for every dollar earned by men in 2019.\nThis uncontrolled pay gap measures the median salary for all men and women regardless of variables like race, job type, location and industry. When controlled for factors such job title and seniority, the gap narrows, with some experts calculating a disparity as small as 98 percent .\nBut significantly larger pay gaps become apparent when considering factors like education. According to PayScale, highly-educated women experience among the largest pay gaps: Women with MBAs take home 74 cents for every dollar earned by men with MBAs.\nWhen the U.S. Census first started collecting data on Americans' educational attainment in 1967, about 12 percent of women and 17 percent of men between the ages of 25 and 29 held bachelor's degrees. Today, women outnumber men at all levels of education . Business school remains one of the few areas where men are still a majority.\nMen and women of all races tend to see a salary bump of 63 percent or more after earning an MBA. But experts say that differences in how often men and women are promoted after graduating from business school are a key driver of the gender pay gap among MBAs.\n\"A lot of [the gap] has to do with industry and with promotion velocity,\" Lydia Frank, PaySc Vice President of Content Strategy, tells CNBC Make It . \"If women aren't making it to the executive team and the C-Level with as great frequency as their male peers, then of course there's this big disparity in the MBA numbers, right? Because many CEOs and other C-level execs do have MBAs, and most of them are men.\"\n\"The promotion piece,\" she says, \"is a part of this uncontrolled pay gap story. If you look at all men working in our economy versus all women working, men are over-represented in leadership positions, whether that's C-level, VP and even the senior director level.\" PeopleImages | Getty Images\nWomen also tend to enter lower-paying fields, even when they have similar educational backgrounds to men. Women with MBAs are more likely to pursue careers in marketing and advertising compared to men, while men are more likely to pursue careers in higher-paying industries like financial services.\n\"I would say sometimes it's a choice and sometimes it's not,\" says Frank. \"Sometimes that's just where they're getting hired, even if they have been attempting to be hired elsewhere.\"\nAccording to Nicole Smith, Research Professor and Chief Economist at the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce (CEW), the lower-paying fields that women pursue do account for some of the pay gap, but not all of it.\n\"We still have women making personal decisions to pursue degrees that pay less,\" Smith tells CNBC Make It , listing fields such as teaching and nursing as examples of low-paying occupations that women pursue disproportionately. \"We still have occupational segregation, which yes, it is a personal decision, but it's also driven by socioeconomic challenges and it is also driven by expectations about what roles women should play in society.\"\n\"Occupational segregation\" is just one factor that contributes to the current pay gap, says Smith. When the CEW looked at salaries among individuals in the same industries with the same jobs and the exact same level of education, men still earned more. When controlled for factors such as these, Smith and her team found that women still earn about 92 cents for every dollar a man makes.\nAnthony P. Carnevale , lead author of Georgetown's report, says that ultimately, the reason highly-educated women experience significant wage gaps is discrimination.\n\"Women's earnings still lag their exceptional educational progress,\" he says in a statement. \"At the heart of the gender wage gap is discrimination in pay for the same sets of qualifications and experience.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "timothy a. clary", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "organizations": [{"name": "payscale", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T21:28:39.053+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d94c3a355a5d8606d14689a290982512a12f6293", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-legendary-gatekeeper-of-the-stock-marketwhose-picks-dictated-trillions-in-etf-holdings-is-retiring-2019-04-02", "site_full": "www.marketwatch.com", "site": "marketwatch.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "The legendary \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 of the stock market\u2014whose picks dictated trillions in ETF holdings \u2014 is retiring - MarketWatch", "title_full": "The legendary \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 of the stock market\u2014whose picks dictated trillions in ETF holdings \u2014 is retiring - MarketWatch", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GS653_blitze_ZG_20181029142407.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 900, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 23, "comments": 1, "shares": 30}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d94c3a355a5d8606d14689a290982512a12f6293", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-legendary-gatekeeper-of-the-stock-marketwhose-picks-dictated-trillions-in-etf-holdings-is-retiring-2019-04-02", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mark Decambre", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The legendary \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 of the stock market\u2014whose picks dictated trillions in ETF holdings \u2014 is retiring - MarketWatch", "text": "Blitzer is set to retire at the end of August Bloomberg David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the Index Committee and S&P Dow Jones Indices, is retiring.\nBy Mark DeCambre\nDavid Blitzer \u2014 a stock-market indexing icon \u2014 is retiring at the end of August, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, after nearly a quarter-century of picking the stocks that make up America\u2019s most closely followed equity benchmarks.\nBlitzer, who has overseen the composition of the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.21% and the 123-year-old Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.15% for years, is considered a luminary among those who follow indexing \u2014 the selection of individual stocks (or other assets) in a benchmark.\nThe 70-year-old has led the S&P\u2019s stock committee that has helped to determine the makeup of S&P 500 and Dow, with some $10 trillion in exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, pegged to the S&P 500, allowing mom- and-pop investors to cheaply and efficiently gain exposure to the stock market in popular products like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, +0.16% and the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust DIA, +0.12%\nExchange-traded fund focused website ETF.com in a 2015 Q&A referred to Blitzer as one of the \u201c legends of indexing. \u201d And a 2017 Wall Street Journal article called him the \u201cgatekeeper of the S&P 500.\u201d\nAverage folks, however, may have trouble ID\u2019ing the financial professional, known for his signature bow tie, in a lineup of Wall Street\u2019s Who\u2019s Who.\nBlitzer acknowledged as much to MarketWatch in a phone interview on Tuesday, saying that he\u2019s heard the \u201clegend\u201d characterization bandied about in reference to his spot in the investing pantheon, along with the likes of Vanguard founder Jack Bogle, the father of ETFs and passive investing.\n\u201cI\u2019m not quite sure what it means to be a legend,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be mentioned as somewhat in the same sentence [as Jack Bogle] is very nice and much appreciated and a credit to everyone at S&P,\u201d he said.\nRead: Jack Bogle was the greatest investor who never managed money\nThe indexing pro\u2019s decision to step down comes as passive investing, buying ETFs or fund products that track indexes, has exploded. In 2017, index funds accounted for 35% of total U.S. fund assets , versus 15% a decade earlier. In 2017 the net flow of new investment assets into index funds was $692 billion, while the net flow into actively managed funds was negative \u2014 minus $7 billion.\nBlitzer has been the maestro of the construction of these indexes, underlined by recent changes to the Dow industrials.\nOn Tuesday, materials-science company Dow Inc.

Inc. TRV, -0.15% is smaller at $36 billion). Blitzer said there were a number of factors in deciding to keep Dow Inc. within the blue-chip index.\n\u201cWe looked at handling this process in a way that is not disruptive to the index and not disruptive to the market,\u201d he told MarketWatch. He said ensuring that the Dow index doesn\u2019t hew too far from its roots as an industrials benchmark also was a factor in the S&P stock committee\u2019s decision making, with few materials and industrials entities that might meet the criteria as apt replacement for Dow Inc.\n\u201cThat is definitely a consideration. The Dow traditionally was industrials with a capital \u2018I\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe respect that it has changed over time\u2026the idea that we should keep representation of traditional industrials companies is definitely a consideration,\u201d Blitzer said. \u201cIt is always a balancing act,\u201d he said.\nBlitzer first joined McGraw Hill Companies, (which became S&P Global) in 1980 as a corporate economist. In 1982, he was appointed Standard & Poor\u2019s chief economist, and later in 1989, he joined the index committee, becoming its chairman in 1995.\nLooking ahead, Blitzer said investors are faced with a number of uncertainties that could stoke fresh stock-market volatility. \u201cI think what we\u2019re looking at a lot of unknowns and the future gotchas,\u201d he said.\nThe Dow has gained 12.2% so far in 2019, the S&P 500 has risen by 14.3% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.60% boasts a handsome return of 18.2% in the first four months of the year.\n\u201cThe volatility has been intriguing,\u201d Blitzer said, referring to the bumps along the way, including late-2018 trade that culminated in the worst Christmas Eve plunge for stocks on record .\nStill, Blitzer, a champion of long-term investing over market timing, said the biggest risk for investors is that they will get spooked by a big downturn.\nThe big risk is that \u201cthe market goes down \u2014 and it will \u2014 and they get scared off and it goes down. and they sell and they don\u2019t come back,\u201d he said.\nFor his part, Blitzer is holding on to S&P 500 ETFs, though he won\u2019t say which brand. His business has dictated that he cannot own individual stocks.\nAs for his decadeslong career: \u201cLooking back, [I have] no complaints, so far, it\u2019s been wonderful and I\u2019m willing to bet the next stage will be good,\u201d he Blitzer said.\nBlitzer\u2019s retirement, he said, was finally decided at the end of last year after consulting with his family, which consists of his wife, a son a daughter and one grandchild.\nProviding critical information for the U.S. trading day.

He wants the country to progress ,\" said the PML-Q chief in an exclusive interview with a private television channel on Monday.\n\" All politicians of the country should work for the national good.\"Hussain said people who destructed the economy should be penalised. However, he said, it won't make any major difference if NAB captures people who undertook corruption worth merely Rs300,000 or Rs 400,000.He also opposed the 18th Constitutional Amendment - a topic the Pakistan Peoples Party is sensitive about.\n\"The 18th Amendment was a criminal offence to the future generations,\" he said. \" Education was handed to the provinces and this was a major wrong committed through the amendment. Education is a Federal subject in every country as a uniform syllabus is taught to all children across the country. \"It's quite unfortunate that the matter is being politicised, he said, demanding that education be abolished from the amendment and it be made a federal matter again.The PML-Q chief also commented on the anti-government train march launched by PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in March .\nHe said the train march won't make any difference to [Prime Minister] Imran Khan as he knows \ufffdBilawal is a child'.\"In his childhood days, he [Bilawal] must have played with trains.

Lending rates were lowered and the policy stance shifted at his first meeting in February.\nWhile the central bank justified that move by highlighting a lower inflation outlook and a slowdown in growth, not everyone was convinced those were the only reasons behind the policy easing.\n\"We already know that the central bank is under pressure from the government to ease policy. We have two meetings in Q2 - April and June - with this pressure if they cut rates they would rather do it in April than in June,\" said Prakash Sakpal, Asia economist at ING.\n\"No matter how effective this will be in time for the election - it is hard to imagine that just one week before the elections you cut the rate and that does magic and boosts growth. It will be a token from which the government takes credit.\"\nSakpal, like many other contributors in the poll, wasn`t convinced the economy needs more easing at a time when the outlook for core inflation remains elevated and the government`s latest populist measures ahead of the general election would weigh on prices.\nMore than 85 percent of nearly 70 economists polled over the past week forecast the RBI would cut its benchmark lending rate, the repo rate, to 6.00 percent on April 4. The consensus showed the central bank would then keep rates on hold through to the middle of next year at least.\nJust under half of economists expect the RBI to make at least one more cut after this month`s meeting, which would take the repo rate to its lowest since 2010.\nInflation has remained below the RBI`s 4 percent target for seven straight months and was expected to average 4.0 percent this fiscal year.\nBut core inflation, which excludes food and fuel, is running closer to 5.5 percent.\n\"My biggest worry is that the rate cut would be ineffective as banks are not ready to transfer that to borrowers,\" said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank. \"And a rate cut under (the) wrong circumstances can cause a rupee depreciation and macro instability.\"\nIndia`s growth outlook for the fiscal year ended in March and the current one was cut to 7.1 percent and 7.2 percent, respectively, from 7.3 percent predicted for both three months ago.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi`s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has faced criticism from opposition parties and economists for having allegedly manipulated economic growth figures and suppressing the release of jobs data to show the economy has performed better under his leadership.\nFifty-three percent of economists who answered an additional question said they were confident about the accuracy of recent official Indian economic data releases, but the remaining 47 percent said they were not.\n\"There have been reports of the government forcing the statistical agency to sit on the report until after the elections. This is probably the fact with most big developing economies \u2013 China has the same issue, nobody trusts China`s data, but we still have to rely on that,\" ING`s Sakpal added.\nEconomists unanimously said the BJP winning a majority or a BJP-led NDA (National Democratic Alliance) government would be best for the economy.\nNone said a Congress majority or the Congress-led UPA (United Progressive Alliance) or a coalition of regional parties - also known as the Third Front - would be best.\nThat broadly aligns with a separate Reuters poll of equity strategists and brokers, which showed a majority win for the ruling party would be the most favourable outcome for Indian stocks. \"In order to push reforms ahead, a BJP win is necessary, as the opposition mainly has been focusing on attacking the NDA, rather than presenting an alternative policy agenda,\" said Hugo Erken, senior economist at Rabobank.

At the time, the U.S. stocks were near all-time highs and the economy was growing above trend, while China was stumbling and its stock market was in the middle of a year long sell off. But since Trump signaled progress in talks in late December, both U.S. and Chinese stocks turned around, with China's 27 percent year-to-date gain leading world markets higher. Published 3:07 PM ET Tue, 2 April 2019 Updated 3:49 PM ET Tue, 2 April 2019 CNBC.com Fred Dufour | AFP | Getty Images President Donald Trump (L) shakes hand with China's President Xi Jinping at the end of a press conference at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on November 9, 2017.\nWhen the U.S. escalated the trade war by slapping tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods last September, China's economy was struggling and its stock market was in a deep slide, giving the U.S. a seeming advantage in a trans-Pacific trade rift.\nBut months later, the U.S. has lost some of that edge. China's Shanghai stock market has surged more than 27 percent in 2019 and is the best performer of major markets globally, while China's economy is finally showing early signs of stabilizing.\nWhen the September tariffs were announced, President Donald Trump was seen as emboldened by the best two quarters of more than 3 percent U.S. growth in years and a stock market that was hitting all-time highs. While the U.S. is still seen as having an advantage, economic growth has faltered, to a below trend 1.5 percent pace in the first quarter. The U.S. stock market is also trying to recapture those 2018 highs, despite strong gains after December's sharp selloff.\nTrade friction and tariffs have put a dent in both economies, and show up in record trade deficits between the U.S. and China. But China's wobbling economy may be perking up. Manufacturing data this week showed that activity was expanding again.\n\"I think the developments in China are significant. The purchasing managers' numbers in China were much better than expected. It really was the first green shoots that are fairly convincing here. Clearly, China has opened the spigots on policy easing,\" said Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \"Last month, they introduced a big tax cut. They made it very clear, they're pressuring more lending. The purchasing manager's number is one of the first things that shows this is starting to change business sentiment.\"\nHigh level trade talks are continuing this week in Washington, and it appears progress is being made.\nStrategists say the role of the stock market has become an important factor in trade negotiations, after the 14 percent dive in the S&P 500 in the fourth quarter and the 25 percent decline in Shanghai stocks for all of 2018. The U.S. stock market bottomed in the final week of December, and shortly after Trump announced progress in talks with Beijing. Shanghai and Wall Street stocks have both moved mostly higher since then, and the two sides have stayed at the negotiating table.\nSource: Citigroup\n\"To the extent that the economy has moderated a bit, and the U.S. administration pays more attention to the stock market, suggests it will be more sensitive to imposing tariffs on China, relative to how it was before,\" said Cesar Rojas, Citigroup global economist. For now, the U.S. has frozen tariffs at $250 billion on Chinese goods, and Trump held off increasing the tariffs while talks continued. U.S. GDP growth\nHarris said China has used a double barreled fiscal and monetary stimulus to boost its economy. \"The tax cuts are probably worth maybe a half percent to growth, but again that's the tip of the ice berg. The more interesting question is how much is the pressure to increase lending going to help. That's the main stimulus, and we just don't know,\" he said. \"If they didn't have the stimulus, they would be in a much weaker negotiating position. The incentive to overdue it is pretty high and they can end up with an economy that instead of settling into more modest growth is probably going to rebound in a way they don't want.\"\nIf there is a trade deal and confidence improves, Harris said there's a chance the Chinese economy could boom later in the year. \"I think the question is, do they overstimulate?\" he said.\nFor the U.S. economy, meanwhile, second quarter growth is expected to pick up and economists now see growth above 2.5 percent after the first quarter slump. The rest of the year is expected to grow at about the same pace.\nRojas said both governments are looking for a win. He said a trade deal could include increased Chinese purchases of soy beans, corn and other goods from the U.S. But China may want to take its time though many analysts expect a deal this quarter.\n\"As they become more stabilized, the challenge for a trade deal in the very short term will increase because they will not be rushed to give very strong concessions to the U.S.,\" he said.\nSome analysts remain skeptical about China's economic progress. Paul Christopher, chief international investment strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors, said he believes it's too soon to say China is stabilizing, and while he expects a deal on trade, he does not see it until this summer.\n\"There definitely is room for both sides to make progress. The Chinese need some help on the economy. the president need some help on his 2020 election campaign, but he can't afford to be too easy on the Chinese and the Chinese can't be too easy on the U.S.,\" said Christopher.\n\"Could sentiment in the stock market rebound? Yes, if it becomes apparent that neither president has given away too much. It's not a clear cut case that a trade deal necessarily helps the economy in either country. We do think it would help sentiment in the stock market unless it's perceived to be a bad deal or they leave all the tariffs on,\" he said.\n.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fred dufour", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "xi jinping", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shanghai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "great hall of the people", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T22:08:02.051+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d832e53f970266abde4e24533e9e96a545962cfd", "url": "https://www.rawstory.com/2019/04/trump-willing-to-tank-economy-to-get-his-wall-built-security-is-more-important-than-trade/", "site_full": "www.rawstory.com", "site": "rawstory.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "", "title": "Trump willing to tank economy to get his wall built: 'Security is more important than trade'", "title_full": "Trump willing to tank economy to get his wall built: 'Security is more important than trade'", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/President-Donald-Trump-800x430.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 2437, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 474, "comments": 127, "shares": 125}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d832e53f970266abde4e24533e9e96a545962cfd", "url": "https://www.rawstory.com/2019/04/trump-willing-to-tank-economy-to-get-his-wall-built-security-is-more-important-than-trade/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brendan Skwire", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Trump willing to tank economy to get his wall built: 'Security is more important than trade'", "text": "President Donald Trump/CNN screen shot Don't miss stories.

These policies will lead to an uptick in growth in the second half of this year and into 2020, she said.\nThe IMF lowered its global growth forecast for 2019 and 2020 in January, and warned of the dangers from escalating trade tensions that have already started to dampen the world economic outlook.\nThe global economy is set to expand 3.5 per cent in 2019 and 3.6 per cent the year after, 0.2 and 0.1 percentage points lower than the fund's October forecasts. Growth for 2018 was projected at 3.7 per cent.\nThe IMF, which will hold its spring meetings next week, will release an update of its global growth forecast that shows the world\u2019s economy had \u201clost further momentum\u201d, she said.\n\u201cThe expected rebound in global growth later this year is precarious,\u201d said Ms Lagarde. \u201cIt is vulnerable to downside risks - including country-related uncertainties, such as Brexit, and broader uncertainties such as high debt in some sectors and countries, tensions around trade policy, and a sense of unease in financial markets.\u201d\nThe world economy is slowing down as a trade rift between the United States and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies, intensifies. Last year, the US slapped 10 per cent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. Washington and Beijing are currently in talks to resolve their trade war.\nMs Lagarde proposed three types of action to help ensure a soft-landing for the global slowdown.\nFirst, countries must undertake domestic polices that include structural reforms to boost productivity and long-term growth.\nMs Lagarde also pointed to the growing power of a few corporate giants and advocated for reining their influence on the domestic economies of countries.\n\u201cNew IMF analysis shows that, over the past two decades, rising corporate market power in advanced economies had only a very small effect on investment, output and the share of national income paid to workers,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut we also found that a small number of highly dynamic companies accounted for the highest price mark-ups.\u201d\nThe European Union, for example, has penalised companies deemed to challenge competition.\nIn March, the EU fined Google \u20ac1.49 billion (Dh6.12bn), the economic bloc\u2019s third antitrust fine slapped on the technology giant, for stifling competition in the online advertisement sector.\nWith regards to the second course of action related to cross-border polices, Ms Lagarde warned of the danger of trade barriers and their knock-on effect on growth.\n\u201cWe have looked at what might happen if tariffs on all goods traded between the US and China went up by 25 percentage points. That alone would reduce annual GDP by up to 0.6 per cent in the US and by up to 1.5 per cent in China,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThese are potentially self-inflicted wounds that should be avoided.\u201d\nMs Lagarde also warned of the dangers of tax evasion. Non-OECD countries lose some $200bn a year due to companies moving profit to low-income jurisdictions. This lost income makes it harder for low-income countries to boost growth and employment.\nWith regards to the third policy addressing global challenges, Ms Lagarde pointed to the economic cost of climate change and corruption.\nGlobal energy subsidies, which amount to $5.2 trillion per year or 6.5 per cent of global GDP, are impacting climate change and need to be reduced.\nMeanwhile, the annual cost of bribery is over $1.5tn, equivalent to 2 per cent of GDP, necessitating a stepping up efforts to resolve issues such as money laundering and the financing of terrorism.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lagarde", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine lagarde", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "imf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international monetary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us fed", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T22:22:30.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f5e53c8178801ea91c13ca9a7a3fc5d54fbcfee9", "url": "https://za.investing.com/news/economy-news/lagarde-says-the-global-economy-has-lost-momentum-since-january-1441147", "site_full": "za.investing.com", "site": "investing.com", "site_section": "https://za.investing.com/news/economy-news", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Economic News - Investing.com ZA", "title": "Lagarde Says the Global Economy Has Lost Momentum Since January", "title_full": "Lagarde Says the Global Economy Has Lost Momentum Since January By Bloomberg", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picc5c855d8b20a6407c39186b059351048.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 699, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f5e53c8178801ea91c13ca9a7a3fc5d54fbcfee9", "url": "https://za.investing.com/news/economy-news/lagarde-says-the-global-economy-has-lost-momentum-since-january-1441147", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bloomberg", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Lagarde Says the Global Economy Has Lost Momentum Since January", "text": "\u00a9 Bloomberg. Christine Lagarde Photographer: Justin Chin/Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Global growth has lost momentum since the start of the year, leaving the world economy in a \u201cprecarious\u201d position, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said.\nThe global economy has weakened since the International Monetary Fund last updated its forecast in late January, though a recession isn\u2019t likely in the near term, Lagarde said Tuesday in remarks prepared for a speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington.\nIn January, the fund lowered its projection for world economic growth, forecasting expansion of 3.5 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2020. It was the IMF\u2019s second cut in the outlook in three months. The fund will release its new World Economic Outlook with an updated growth forecast on April 9.\n\u201cThe global economy is at a \u2018delicate moment,\u2019\u201d Lagarde said.\nHer warning comes as global finance ministers and central bankers prepare to convene in Washington next week for the semi-annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank. While confidence has been boosted by the Federal Reserve\u2019s switch to a more patient stance and signs of a trade deal between the U.S. and China, investors remain concerned the global expansion may be running out of steam a decade after the financial crisis.\nRate Patience\nLagarde said the global economy is set to benefit from the patience of major central banks, as well as increased stimulus by the Chinese government. The IMF predicts global growth will pick up \u201csome\u201d in the second half of 2019 and into 2020, she said.\nStill, that rebound remains vulnerable to a host of risks, including Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, high debt in some sectors and countries, trade tensions and \u201ca sense of unease in financial markets,\u201d Lagarde said.\nGiven the state of the global economy, it\u2019s important for policy makers to avoid missteps, she said. Monetary policy should remain accommodative where inflation is below target, while exchange-rate flexibility should be used as needed, according to Lagarde. Regulatory reforms aimed at strengthening the financial sector should continue, she added.\nHigh public debt and low interest rates have left \u201climited room to act when the next downturn comes, which inevitably it will,\u201d she said. \u201cFor many countries, this implies making smarter use of fiscal policy.\u201d\nThe market power of corporations has been increasing, with the highest price markups being imposed by a \u201csmall number of highly dynamic companies,\u201d a trend that is especially pronounced in the digital economy, Lagarde said.\nMarket Power\n\u201cI am not saying that we currently have a \u2018monopoly problem.\u2019 But I am saying that we should take appropriate measures -- so that it does not become a problem,\u201d she said.\nLagarde reiterated her warning for countries to avoid imposing new tariffs on each other. An increase in tariffs by 25 percentage points on all goods traded between the U.S. and China would reduce annual output in the U.S. by up to 0.6 percent, and up to 1.5 percent in China, she said.\n\u201cThese are potentially self-inflicted wounds that should be avoided,\u201d Lagarde said.\nHigh-level trade talks between the U.S. and China resume this week in Washington amid hopes the world\u2019s two biggest economies can reach a deal to end their trade war.\nLagarde Says the Global Economy Has Lost Momentum Since January", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fza.investing.com%2Fnews%2Feconomy-news%2Flagarde-says-the-global-economy-has-lost-momentum-since-january-1441147&title=Lagarde+Says+the+Global+Economy+Has+Lost+Momentum+Since+January&summary=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=179222828858436&u=https%3A%2F%2Fza.investing.com%2Fnews%2Feconomy-news%2Flagarde-says-the-global-economy-has-lost-momentum-since-january-1441147&display=popup&ref=plugin", "https://invst.ly/afy97"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lagarde", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "justin chin/bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "christine lagarde", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "imf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international monetary fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. chamber of commerce", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T22:53:52.076+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "060648b78a5cf2b854ea1af33b8a582a115ef5a7", "url": "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/us/2019/04/02/finally-50-cent-sells-opulent-connecticut-mansion.html", "site_full": "www.thestar.com", "site": "thestar.com", "site_section": "http://www.thestar.com/feeds.articles.news.world.rss", "site_categories": ["media", "hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "TORONTO STAR", "title": "Finally! 50 Cent sells opulent Connecticut mansion", "title_full": "Finally! 50 Cent sells opulent Connecticut mansion | The Star", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.thestar.com/assets/img/thestar-ribbon.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3654, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "060648b78a5cf2b854ea1af33b8a582a115ef5a7", "url": "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/us/2019/04/02/finally-50-cent-sells-opulent-connecticut-mansion.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "thestar.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Finally! 50 Cent sells opulent Connecticut mansion", "text": "News World United States Finally! 50 Cent sells opulent Connecticut mansion By FARMINGTON, Conn. - Rapper 50 Cent\u2019s 50,000-square-foot mansion in Connecticut that first went on the market 12 years ago has finally sold at a fraction of the original asking price.\nJennifer Leahy, an agent at Douglas Elliman in Greenwich, tells the Hartford Courant the 21-bedroom. 25-bathroom home in Farmington was sold for $2.9 million.\nThe sale was first reported by The Wall Street Journal .\nThe rapper, whose real name is Curtis James Jackson III, asked $18.5 million for the 17-acre estate in 2007.
