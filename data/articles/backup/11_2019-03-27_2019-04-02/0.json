Abigail Malbon From Country Living I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever wanted anything quite as much as I currently want Walmart's inflatable hot tub. The Pure Spa 4-person inflatable hot tub, $380, is here just in time for (hopefully) warmer weather-and you can bet we'll be purchasing one ASAP before they sell out. The hot tub is suitable for indoor or outdoor use and features a 210-gallon pool with 120 air jets and a 2200W heater. A HEATER, yes, that's right. Four people can fit comfortably inside at one time, and it even comes with an insulating lid to keep the water warm if you decide to hop out for a BBQ burger or two. Sure, summer might feel like nothing but a far away dream right now, but imagine having all your pals over for some quality time and some bubbles (literally) in this perfect product. BLISS. Want to invite over an even bigger crowd? There are plenty of similar models available that can seat up to six people. Bonus: some of them are on sale now!

Get all of the details on the popular swimsuits here.\nI don't know if you've been paying attention, but Walmart has seriously stepped its game up, \u2014 from beautiful furniture collections backed by Drew Barrymore to the Sofia Vergara -approved jeans . Now, the retailer is taking over the swimsuit arena, with its in-house Time and Tru collection of mix and match separates.\nAccording to Walmart reps (and the endless amounts of praise on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram), shoppers can't get enough of the best-selling bikinis by Time and Tru , which are made to fit sizes small all the way up to a 3x. And get this: the affordable designs are less than $18, so you'll have plenty of money leftover to sip pi\u00f1a coladas by the pool.\nWhat's even better are the functional details in the Time and Tru lineup, which include underwire finishes and adjustable straps to ensure the perfect fit, as endorsed by influencer Noelle Downing , who posted a sponsored post in the underwire bikini top ($16; walmart.com ) and lace-up bottoms ($16; walmart.com ) above. They're so good, in fact, that people are passing on Victoria's Secret push-up styles for Walmart's selects. One of InStyle 's Facebook followers tipped us off in the comment section underneath a VS post, admitting to finding awesome plus-size options at Wally World, for a fraction of the price.\nAnd Walmart's also giving Target's beloved swimsuits a run for their money. On Twitter Emmie wrote, \"I tried a lot on at Target and wasn\u2019t feeling it. Online Walmart!!! That\u2019s where I found two Time and Tru plus size swimsuits!\"\nPeak season to grab the Time and Tru swimsuits is in May. But if you wait to late your favorite style or size might be sold out.

Collapse\nJust like we witnessed during the last recession, major retailers are laying off tens of thousands of workers, and it looks like this will be the worst year for store closings in all of U.S. history. Many are referring to this as \u201cthe retail apocalypse\u201d , and without a doubt this is one of the toughest stretches for retailers that we have ever seen. But many believe that what we have witnessed so far is just the beginning . After all, if retailers are struggling this much now, how bad will things be once the next recession really gets rolling?\nOf course the truth is that things have been rocky for the retail industry for quite a few years, but the numbers are telling us that this crisis is really starting to accelerate.\n***Support BeforeItsNews by trying APeX (far superior to colloidal silver) or any of our other great health products at www.mitocopper.com *** According to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, retail layoffs were up a whopping 92 percent in January and February compared to the same period a year ago. The following comes from NBC News \u2026\nMore than 41,000 people have lost their jobs in the retail industry so far this year \u2014 a 92 percent spike in layoffs since the same time last year, according to a new report.\nAnd the layoffs continue to mount, with JCPenney announcing this week it would be closing 18 stores in addition to three previously announced closures, as part of a \u201cstandard annual review.\u201d\nYes, competition from Internet commerce is hurting the traditional retail industry, but it certainly doesn\u2019t explain a 92 percent increase.\nAnd very few retailers have been able to avoid this downsizing trend. At this point, even the largest retailer in the entire country has begun \u201cquietly closing stores\u201d \u2026\nWalmart is closing at least 11 US stores across eight states.\nThe stores include one Walmart Supercenter in Lafayette, Louisiana, and Walmart Neighborhood Market stores in Arizona, California, Kansas, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Washington.\nFor decades, Wal-Mart has been expanding extremely aggressively.\nThey have plenty of cash, and so the only way that it would make sense for them to close stores is if they anticipated that we are heading into a recession.\nHere is a list of the addresses where Wal-Mart stores are closing \u2026\n6085 W. Chandler Blvd., Chandler, Arizona\n3900 W. Ina Road, Tucson, Arizona\n1600 Saratoga Ave., San Jose, California\n712 N. Western Ave., Liberal, Kansas\n1229 NE. Evangeline Trwy., Lafayette, Louisiana\n3603 Broad River Road, Columbia, South Carolina\n1757 W. Andrew Johnson Hwy., Morristown, Tennessee\n2501 University Commons Way, Knoxville, Tennessee\n7000 Iron Bridge Road, North Chesterfield, Virginia\n2864 Virginia Beach Blvd., Virginia Beach, Virginia\n7809 NE. Vancouver Plaza Dr., Vancouver, Washington\nOf course Wal-Mart is in far better shape than almost everyone else in the industry.\nOne of Wal-Mart\u2019s key competitors, Shopko, has just announced that they will be shutting down all of their stores \u2026\nShopko will liquidate its assets and close all of its remaining locations by mid-June.\nThe company was unable to find a buyer for the retail business and will begin winding down its operations beginning this week, the company said in statement released Monday. The decision to liquidate will bring an end to the brick-and-mortar business that began in 1962 with one location in Green Bay, Wisconsin.\nAnd personally I was very saddened to learn that Lifeway Christian Bookstores has also decided to close all their brick and mortar stores \u2026\nLifeway Christian Bookstores announced last week it would be closing the doors of all 170 brick and mortar stores, in a pivot to focusing on digital and e-commerce.\n\u201cThe decision to close our local stores is a difficult one,\u201d said Lifeway Chief Executive Officer Brad Waggoner. \u201cWhile we had hoped to keep some stores open, current market projections show this is no longer a viable option.\u201d\nWhenever I do an article like this, I always have some readers that try to convince me that this is only happening because of the growth of Internet retailing.\nAnd yes, Internet retailing has been growing, but it still accounts for less than 10 percent of all U.S. retail sales. In addition, it is important to point out that Internet retailers had a very disappointing holiday season just like brick and mortar retailers did.\nUltimately, the truth is that the U.S. economy has been steadily slowing down in recent months.\nDuring the months of December, January and February, the amount of stuff being moved around the country by truck, rail and air was lower than during all of those same months a year earlier. The following comes from Wolf Richter \u2026\nNow it\u2019s the third month in a row, and the red flag is getting more visible and a little harder to ignore about the goods-based economy: Freight shipment volume in the US across all modes of transportation \u2013 truck, rail, air, and barge \u2013 in February fell 2.1% from February a year ago, according to the Cass Freight Index , released today. The three months in a row of year-over-year declines are the first such declines since the transportation recession of 2015 and 2016.\nI have a feeling that when we get the final numbers for March that they will show that this streak has now extended to four months.\nRight now, unsold goods are starting to pile up in U.S. warehouses at a rate that we haven\u2019t seen since the last recession. Many retailers that are barely clinging to life will simply not survive if economic conditions continue to deteriorate.\nUnfortunately, it appears that things are only going to get rougher for the U.S. economy in the months ahead.\nSo more retail workers are going to get laid off, more stores are going to close, and there are going to be a lot more stories about our ongoing \u201cretail apocalypse\u201d in the mainstream media.\nAbout the author: Michael Snyder is a nationally-syndicated writer, media personality and political activist.

By PTI\nDUBAI: The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has approved a new rule for expats under which foreign workers will now be able to sponsor their family members if they fulfil a certain income criteria, a move which will benefit lakhs of Indians.\nIndians in the UAE constitute the largest part of population of the country.\nApproximately 3.3 million non-resident Indians constitute about 30 per cent of the total population of the UAE, according to the Indian Embassy in the UAE.\nIncome will be the only requirement for UAE expatriates to sponsor their family members as opposed to the previously listed 'professions', the UAE Cabinet announced on Sunday as it adopted a decision to amend provisions of the resolution on foreign workers sponsoring their families.\nThe Cabinet made the decision to reaffirms the UAE's position \"as a hub for talents and a land of opportunities\", the Khaleej Times reported.\nUnder the prevalent guidelines, male expats can sponsor their immediate family members such as wife and children if he earns a monthly salary of Dh 4,000 (approximately Rs 75,000) or Dh 3,000 (Rs 56,000) plus accommodation provided by his company.\nHe also had to be employed in certain categories for him to be eligible to sponsor his family.\nFor example, domestic helpers and certain other categories were not entitled to sponsor their families irrespective of their monthly income, the report said.

Image zoom NOELLEDOWNING/INSTAGRAM\nI don't know if you've been paying attention, but Walmart has seriously stepped its game up, \u2014 from beautiful furniture collections backed by Drew Barrymore to the Sofia Vergara -approved jeans . Now, the retailer is taking over the swimsuit arena, with its in-house Time and Tru collection of mix and match separates.\nAccording to Walmart reps (and the endless amounts of praise on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram), shoppers can't get enough of the best-selling bikinis by Time and Tru , which are made to fit sizes small all the way up to a 3x. And get this: the affordable designs are less than $18, so you'll have plenty of money leftover to sip pi\u00f1a coladas by the pool.\nWhat's even better are the functional details in the Time and Tru lineup, which include underwire finishes and adjustable straps to ensure the perfect fit, as endorsed by influencer Noelle Downing , who posted a sponsored post in the underwire bikini top ($16; walmart.com ) and lace-up bottoms ($16; walmart.com ) above. They're so good, in fact, that people are passing on Victoria's Secret push-up styles for Walmart's selects. One of InStyle 's Facebook followers tipped us off in the comment section underneath a VS post, admitting to finding awesome plus-size options at Wally World, for a fraction of the price. Image zoom FACEBOOK\nAnd Walmart's also giving Target's beloved swimsuits a run for their money. On Twitter Emmie wrote, \"I tried a lot on at Target and wasn\u2019t feeling it. Online Walmart!!! That\u2019s where I found two Time and Tru plus size swimsuits!\" I take that back!! I tried a lot on at target and wasn\u2019t feeling it. Online Walmart!!! That\u2019s where I found two. Time and tru plus size swimsuits! \u2014 Emmie\ud83c\udf4d (@Emmieejacq) March 23, 2019\nPeak season to grab the Time and Tru swimsuits is in May. But if you wait to late your favorite style or size might be sold out. So we'd suggest grabbing one of Walmart's best-sellling swimsuits, asap.

The AP reported :\nThe Trump administration is considering bringing on a \u201cborder\u201d or \u201cimmigration czar\u201d to coordinate the president\u2019s immigration policies across various federal agencies, according to three people familiar with the discussions.\nTrump is weighing two potential candidates for the post: Former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach and former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli \u2014 two far-right conservatives with strong views on immigration, according to the people, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the conversations publicly.\nHowever, the report does not say if the appointee would be responsible for the border only or for the much broader issue of immigration, which includes visa workers, legal immigration, deportations, and much else. The AP described the job vaguely either as \u201ca \u2018border\u2019 or \u2018immigration czar.'\u201d\nThe leak may be designed to rally opposition to the proposal by pairing it with two advocates who are strongly opposed by the business wing of the GOP. Kobach is a strong supporter of Trump, but he is opposed by business groups that support a large-scale inflow of foreign workers. In 2013, Cuccinelli narrowly lost his race for Virginia governor after the Republican National Committee provided him little funding.\nIn the White House, Trump does not have a deputy to daily push his goals and to coordinate the agencies\u2019 rival priorities. As Trump deals with many top-level issues, his competing deputies tend to dominate low-priority debates. For example, Trump\u2019s deputies sidelined his demand for border funding during congressional budget talks in 2017 and 2018. According to the Wall Street Journal :\nIn March [2018], Congress completed a $1.3 trillion spending package, but included just $1.6 billion for a border barrier, with most of the money intended to replace existing fencing. It banned the money from being spent on concrete slabs or any other of the wall prototypes the White House was considering.\nUpset there wasn\u2019t more money for the wall, Mr. Trump threatened to veto it. At an emergency meeting at the White House with his staff and Republican leaders, Mr. Trump learned that the spending bill incorporated all of the border wall money that was requested in the White House budget proposal.\n\u201cWho the f\u2014 put that in my request?\u201d Mr. Trump shouted.\nA top-level coordinator is also needed because immigration issues are divided among several agencies.\nFor example, visas are reviewed and approved by the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State.\nRequests for workers are approved by the Department of Labor, DHS, and the state department.\nAsylum requests are processed by DHS and the justice department.\nThe flow of \u201cUnaccompanied Alien Children\u201d is managed by DHS and the Department of Health and Human Services.\nLawsuits and appeals involving immigration are handled by the Justice Department.\nThe border wall is being managed by the Pentagon\u2019s Corps of Engineers and the DHS.\nA White House czar \u201ccould work, but it is often a bureaucratic way to be seen as doing something,\u201d said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. \u201cIt is probably is a good idea to have one person oversee all the immigration stuff \u2026 but if you just have a border czar, I\u2019m not sure how useful that is.\u201d\nThe czar\u2019s personal authority could be weak or strong, he said. \u201cIt certainly could not hurt \u2014 but it would depend on who it was and how much juice that person had compared to other people in the administration.\u201d Also, he said, the czar \u201cshould be somebody who does nothing but immigration,\u201d he added.\nThe ideological priorities of the person for the job are critical, he said. \u201cThe fact is that we have a DHS Secretary [Kirstjen Nielsen] who does not agree with the administration \u2026 Clearly, if there was a DHS Secretary who actually shared the administration\u2019s professsed goals on immigration, of tightening up the labor market as well as enforcing the border, that would help.\u201d\nEach year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or university. But the federal government then imports approximately 1.1 million legal immigrants, refreshes a resident population of roughly 1.5 million white-collar guest workers and roughly 500,000 blue-collar visa workers, and also tolerates about eight million illegal workers.\nThis federal policy of flooding the market with cheap white-collar graduates and blue-collar foreign labor is intended to boost economic growth for investors. This policy shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors, widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts children\u2019s schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\nGoldman Sachs says Trump's tight labor-market policy (AKA 'Hire American') gave 4% raise to blue-collar/middle-class in 2018.

Matthews on Friday wasn\u2019t David Rickels \u2019 first win since what he called an \u201cembarrassing\u201d loss to Michael Page last May.\nIt was, however, just the type of win that he needed.\n\u201c(The Page fight) was a moment, where my heart was tested in the cage,\u201d Rickels told reporters, including MMA Junkie. \u201cAnd, when you have a moment like that, you want to have a comeback from that, you know what I mean? Like, I\u2019ve still got this (expletive) heart. I\u2019m still competitive in this game.\u201d\nRickels showed that by being hurt early, recovering, listening to his coaches and managing to score a win of his own after a punch rendered A.J. Matthews unable to continue. It wasn\u2019t the exact ending that Rickels wanted, as it took a doctor\u2019s call to end it, but it was still a finish \u2013 Rickels\u2019 first one in more than two years.\nRickels (21-5 MMA, 15-5 BMMA) and Matthews (9-9 MMA, 5-7 BMMA) met in the preliminary card of Friday\u2019s Bellator 219. The welterweight bout streamed live on MMA Junkie from Pechanga Resort Casino in Temecula, Calif.\nIt was a win that also came with some extra flair, too. Known for his inventive walk-outs, Rickels channeled \u201cStone Cold\u201d Steve Austin this time, complete with a \u201cStone Cold Stunner\u201d at the end. The routine, Rickels said, was for his kids, who were watching at home.\nAn overall shining night, however, did have its less positive moments.\nThroughout the initial minutes of the welterweight fight, Rickels kept losing his mouthpiece and the ref kept halting the action for him to put it back in. At one point, the ref even let the action continue for a bit before letting Rickels put it back in and issuing him a warning.\nBackstage, Rickels explained why he was having issued with this particular piece of equipment.\n\u201cI was straight-up embarrassed by it, because I had to go to (expletive) Walmart last minute and buy a new mouthpiece,\u201d Rickels said. \u201cI bought some damn $10 mouthpiece at Walmart, so if there\u2019s a mouthpiece sponsor out there, send me a goddamn mouthpiece that says \u2018Caveman\u2019 on it. Long story (short), my car got broken into and they stole my caveman mouthpiece.\u201d\nConsidering Rickels pulled a comeback as these repeated mouthguard incidents were happening, it\u2019s expected that some would question whether Rickels did it on purpose. But \u201cThe Caveman\u201d believes that, if anyone was helped by the situation, it wasn\u2019t him.\n\u201c(Expletive), I don\u2019t know, man,\u201d Rickels said. \u201cIf anything, it was helping him toward the end, because I had him hurt pretty bad. And then that (expletive) just kept jumping out, you know what I mean? I had him hurt and then I was trying to finish and it was jumping out.\n\u201cThankfully the ref was allowing me to still fight with the mouthpiece out, because I did have him hurt. It was a really weird situation, but got the finish regardless. I was really wanting to (expletive) go toe-to-toe toward the end, but his (expletive) is pretty swollen, so.\u201d\nEven the finish had to come with a little bit of, let\u2019s say, added emotion. After a succession of punches, Matthews got a time out for what he claimed had been an eye poke and, though replays would eventually show it was actually a punch that rendered him unable to continue, Rickels was worried about it for a few seconds.\n\u201cI was worried that he was going to get like an eye poke win, you know what I mean?\u201d Rickels said. \u201cI was like, \u2018(expletive) punched that mother(expletive). I was hoping that they\u2019d check out the replay and they\u2019d clear me. Obviously, everything played out the way it should have.\u201d\nHurdles aside, it was ultimately a good night for Rickels. And he got to share it with some pretty special people.\n\u201cI used to never let my kids watch my fights and I\u2019m like, \u2018Man, (expletive) that, they need to see what heart looks like,\u2019\u201d Rickels said. \u201cAnd, hey, I got to show them today.\u201d\nTo hear from Rickels, check out the video above.\nAnd for complete coverage of Bellator 219 , check out the MMA Events section of the site.

Read on for advice on UK work visas and the application requirements\u2026 Working in the UK during your studies\nIf you\u2019d like to find part-time work while studying in the UK, you\u2019ll need to be aware of the requirements and restrictions that apply to students from your country:\nStudents from the EU, EEA, or Switzerland\nIf you\u2019re from a country within the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, you can work in the UK while studying, without any restrictions or permissions. You should be prepared to show your passport or identity card to your employer to prove you\u2019re an EU national, and should apply for a National Insurance number (scroll to the end of this article for details).\nStudents from outside the EU\nIf you\u2019re a student from outside the EU, you\u2019ll most likely be in the UK on a Tier 4 (General) student visa , which will tell you the number of hours you can work during term-time. If you\u2019re attending a publicly funded UK university at degree level or above, or taking part in a study abroad program at an overseas higher education institution, you can work for up to 20 hours per week during term-time and full-time during the Christmas and Easter breaks.\nYou can\u2019t work if you\u2019re attending a private university (of which there are only five in the country) or a publicly funded college. If you\u2019re aged 16 or 17 or studying below degree level, you are only permitted to work for up to 10 hours per week during term-time. You can have more than one employer as long as you don\u2019t go beyond the 10/20 hours per week limit.\nTime spent completing a permitted work placement as part of your studies will not count as part of your 10 or 20 hours. However, any work placements must not take up more than a third of your total study time \u2013 or half if you\u2019re studying at an overseas higher education institute or on a Tier 4 (Child) visa.\nYou can take up most types of employment, but cannot be self-employed or work in business activity, a role as an entertainer or professional sportsperson (including sports coach), or any permanent full-time position, unless it\u2019s on a recognized foundation program or as a students\u2019 union sabbatical officer. You can work full-time after finishing your degree as long as your visa status is still valid and you don\u2019t work in a permanent position, self-employed, as a doctor or any of the other prohibited roles mentioned above. Working in the UK after graduation\nStudents from the EU, EEA, or Switzerland\nStudents from the EU/EEA and Switzerland are entitled to work and stay in the UK without the need for a visa \u2013 so far there have been no changes to this following the UK\u2019s referendum on membership of the EU . If the UK withdraws from the existing freedom of movement agreement, future EU students may need to apply for visas for study and post-graduation employment.\nStudents from outside the EU/EEA\nThere are various visa schemes open for non-EU students to remain and work in the UK after completing their studies. The Start Up Visa , which will replace the Tier 1 (Graduate Entrepreneur) visa in July 2019, is intended for people outside the EU and Switzerland who want to start their own business in the UK. To apply for this visa, you\u2019ll need to get endorsement from an authorized body , which can be a UK university. You could also be endorsed by the Sirius Programme . You\u2019ll need to pay a fee for this visa, as well as the healthcare surcharge to access the National Health Service (NHS). If your application is successful, you can stay in the UK for two years.\nHowever, the most popular way to gain a UK work visa is through the Tier 2 (General) visa , which is for skilled workers from outside the EEA and Switzerland who have a job offer to work in the UK. To be eligible, the job will usually need to have a salary of at least \u00a320,800 (~US$27,300) per year, although there are some roles excluded from this.\nTo switch from the Tier 4 Student Visa to the Tier 2 visa, you\u2019ll need to have successfully gained a degree from a licensed Tier 4 sponsor . You must be applying from inside the UK and apply before your current visa expires.\nOther eligibility requirements and documents needed include: Evidence that you can support yourself financially \u2013 you must prove with bank statements that you have at least \u00a3945 (~US$1,240) in your account for 90 days before you apply, or a certificate of sponsorship if applicable. A certificate of sponsorship from a licensed sponsor. Proof that you can speak English to the required level, unless you\u2019re from a country where this is not required (list here ). Biometric information (fingerprints and a photograph). Current passport. Tuberculosis test results if you\u2019re from a country where this is required . A criminal record certificate (if you\u2019re working with vulnerable people).\nTo apply, you\u2019ll need to pay the appropriate visa charge and healthcare surcharge for yourself and any dependents . If your application is successful, you can stay in the UK with a Tier 2 (General) visa for a maximum of 5 years and 14 days, or the time given on your certificate of sponsorship plus one month, whichever is shorter. Your stay must start no more than 14 days before the start date on your certificate of sponsorship. After five years, you can apply for a permanent residency card.\nIf you\u2019d prefer to work in the UK for a shorter period, you could apply for the Tier 5 (Temporary Worker - Government Authorised Exchange) visa , which is for those undertaking work experience or training programs. The requirements for this are similar \u2013 you\u2019ll need \u00a3945 in savings and a certificate of sponsorship from your UK sponsor (your employer). This UK work visa allows you to stay in the country for 12 or 24 months, depending on which scheme you apply for. National Insurance numbers\nEveryone who wants to work in the UK will need a National Insurance (NI) number, a unique code which is used to track your tax payments and contributions to the UK\u2019s social security system. This is free to obtain \u2013 you\u2019ll need to apply by phone as soon as possible, and can only do so in the UK. You should have your passport/visa information to hand when you call.\nThe NI number will take around four weeks to be issued, and depending on your visa status, you might be asked to attend an interview. You can start work without a NI number but will need to prove to your employer that you\u2019ve applied for it and give them the number once it\u2019s issued. If you have a biometric residence permit (BRP) you may already have a NI number printed on the back, so you won\u2019t need to apply for another one.\nThis article was originally published in December 2016.

Here are the options Web Report /Dubai Filed on April 2, 2019 | Last updated on April 2, 2019 at 07.26 am Share\n(File photo) Let's talk about the five visa you always hear about. Whether you want to work or simply visit the UAE, several visas are available that can suit your travel plans. While the country issues many other kinds of visas, we're just going to talk about the most common ones. Below are five visas one can use to enter the UAE. Tourist visa As it says on the tin, a tourist visa is used by travellers whose purpose in the country is for tourism. The visa permits the holder to stay in the country for 30 days. To get one, you'll need sponsorship by a UAE airline, hotel and tour operators. Each UAE airline offers visa services when you fly with them. Apart from that, travel agents and hotels can also arrange a tourist visa for you. Visit visa You'll need a friend or relative residing in the country to sponsor your UAE visit visa. They can apply for your visa at any GDRFA office across the emirate and the process takes a few days. After the visa is issued, your sponsor should send you a copy of your permit through fax or email. He should submit the original permit to the airport. When you arrive at the airport, you can collect it from there. It is necessary for you to receive a copy of your entry permit before you leave your country. Transit visa Have a connecting flight with a lengthy stopover? If you're just passing by, UAE airlines also issue transit visas valid for those whose stopover exceeds 8 hours. Passengers with transit visas must leave the country within 96 hours of arrival. If you have a shorter transit time, worry not! Dubai Airports recently proposed that transit passengers may soon be able to experience the city as part of the Dubai 10X initiative. Read more: Dubai to allow transit tourists to visit city Employment visa An employment visa, also known as a work permit, is issued by the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation. It's valid for two months from the date of issuance and you'll need one if you're looking to work in the UAE. As of late February, residents who are changing jobs in the UAE will no longer need a good conduct certificate for the visa if they are in the country. Residence visa The residence visa is the next step after securing an employment visa. Think of it as an evolution of the latter. To secure this, you'll need to get a medical test and apply for another document - the Emirates ID. The UAE Resident Identity Card certifies that the holder is a valid UAE resident. After the whole process is complete, you can now sponsor your family members and bring them into the country as well.

Millions come to UAE from around the world every year. Be it as a tourist or to settle in the country as an expat, the number of visa applications received by UAE authorities every year is phenomenal. Applying for a visit or work visa is a hassle-free process that requires you to fill an application form and provide the necessary documents - scanned copies of your passport, invitation letter from a host in UAE, return tickets (for tourist visa), among others. Please check with your travel agency or company PRO for more details. While it is a seamless process, there are times when the visa may be rejected. Below are the most common reasons: 1. If you held a residence visa previously and left the country without cancelling the UAE visa. To get an approval, the PRO will have to go to the immigration department and clear your previous residency visa. 2. Hand written passports will automatically get rejected by the UAE Immigration. 3. Visa applicants with previous criminal offence, fraud or misconduct committed in the UAE. 4. Previously applied for tourist visa but did not enter the country. In order to get an approval, PRO of the travel agency or sponsor must go to the immigration to clear the previous UAE visa. 5. Applicants who applied for employment visa via a company (prospective employer) but did not enter the country. To get an approval, the PRO of a travel agency or sponsor must go to the UAE immigration and clear the previous employment visa. 6. Visa application with typo errors of name, passport number, and profession code will see a delay in getting approval, or result in rejection of the passport. 7. When photo of the passport copies are not clear or blurred when applied in the online UAE immigration system, the approval might get delayed or rejected. NOTE: Visa rules are subject to changes. Follow UAE embassy in your country or the relevant authority in the UAE.

Share Via Email Published: 02nd April 2019 11:08 AM | Last Updated: 02nd April 2019 11:08 AM | A+ A A- For representational purposes By PTI WASHINGTON: Three Indian-origin consultants have been charged in the US with visa fraud for allegedly submitting sham applications for H-1B visas to gain a competitive advantage over competing firms.\nA federal grand jury last month indicted Kishore Dattapuram, of Santa Clara, Kumar Aswapathi, of Austin, Texas, and Santosh Giri, of San Jose, on 10 counts of substantive visa fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud, the Justice Department said in a statement.\nThe H-1B visa programme allows foreign workers to obtain temporary authorisation to live and work for employers in the United States.\nIn order to secure an H-1B visa, an employer or other sponsor must submit an 'I-129' petition to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.\nA petition and associated documentation must confirm the existence and duration of the job waiting for the worker, and describe key details including the wages associated with the position.\nAccording to the eight-page indictment, Dattapuram, 49, Aswapathi, 49, and Giri, 42 operated Nanosemantics, Inc, a Santa Clara-based consulting firm whose services included placing skilled foreign workers at software and technology companies in the Bay Area.\nThey worked together to submit fraudulent H-1B visa applications on behalf of foreign workers in order to gain a competitive advantage over competing firms.\nThe defendants allegedly used Nanosemantics to submit fraudulent I-129 petitions and obtain H-1B visas for workers that the defendants could later place at local companies.\nBy maintaining a group of available workers, the defendants would gain a competitive advantage over consultants that properly applied for paperwork only after matching a qualified worker to and available job.\nAccording to the indictment, several of the I-129 petitions submitted by defendants stated that particular workers had specific jobs waiting for them at designated companies when, in reality, the defendants knew that these jobs did not exist.\nFurther, the defendants allegedly sought the cooperation of third parties to conceal their fraud.\nFor example, defendants allegedly orchestrated payments by Nanosemantics to at least one individual for permission to list his company as the employer for foreign workers even though Nanosemantics actually intended to place the workers elsewhere.\nFurther, defendants allegedly coached foreign workers and others, to respond to government inquiries in a way that would prevent the government from discovering the fraud.\nThe defendants were charged with one count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud and ten counts of substantive visa fraud.\nThe defendants were arrested last week in their respective towns of residence.\nAll three defendants entered pleas of not guilty and were released on bonds.\nThey are next scheduled to appear on May 13, 2019, for a status conference before Judge Edward J Davila, US District Judge.\nIf convicted, the defendants face a maximum sentence of ten years, and a fine of USD 250,000, plus restitution if appropriate for each violation.

Credit: Daniel Munoz\nBusinesses that apply for the global talent scheme program can then lodge applications for candidates to be granted four-year visas for sought-after talent who would otherwise only be able to stay in Australia for two years.\nLast month, the effectiveness of the program was questioned after a freedom of information request revealed no visas had been issued in the first six months of the visa's one-year pilot.\nAdvertisement StartupAus chief executive Alex McCauley said visa policies take time to \"filter into consciousness\" of the startup community.\n\"It's a critical need area for startups, but it's also hard to convince founders to take the time to solve five-year problems when they're usually focused on five-week problems,\" he said.\nBusinesses that sign up to the scheme before June 30 can enter labour agreements that will last for five years even if the scheme gets axed after the pilot, StartupAus said.\nThe visa is on offer until at least the end of its pilot on July 1. The Labor opposition has its own policy, the SMART visa, a four-year option for those in the science, medicine, academia, research and tech sectors.\nShadow minister for the digital economy, Ed Husic, said besides this policy, Labor would soon \"be announcing reforms to improve the sector's access to digital talent\".\nGeneral manager at Fintech Australia Rebecca Schot-Guppy says regardless of the visa policy on offer, many fintech businesses can't find or recruit the talent they need and complexity is rife.\n\"Examples overseas have shown that it's not enough for government to just introduce a policy. For it to be successful it needs to be promoted and encouraged by government. This includes listening to the community and ensuring the processes involved in applying are straightforward and aren't too time-consuming,\" she said.\nFinTech Australia general manager Rebecca Schot-Guppy.\nMs Schot-Guppy said it was time policymakers started putting themselves in a \"founder mindset\" when designing these policies, including considering the time required for applications.\nOthers believe Australian startups should be looking closer to home to fill tech recruitment roles.\n\"I used to agree that Australia had a lack of tech talent and that the only solution was to source more IT workers from overseas. Then, after starting a business helping connect tech talent with companies, I found this to be far from the truth,\" co-founder of IT solutions firm TechDirect Paula Barry said.\nThe issue is more that upskilling doesn't happen when it is needed, she believes, meaning training policies should be front and centre for policymakers.\n\"The skills that many of our tech workers held as little as five years ago are now no longer relevant.\"\nThe government has been contacted for comment.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_1.37%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_672%2C$y_49/t_crop_custom/w_1456/q_62%2Cf_auto/457ac014af331fd9789bd0fb8cdd3c979a9dfa44", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_1.51%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_672%2C$y_49/t_crop_custom/w_1600/q_62%2Cf_auto/457ac014af331fd9789bd0fb8cdd3c979a9dfa44", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.249%2C$multiply_1.37%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/w_1456/q_62%2Cf_auto/57c15e50c72b3749ceb20e7d8d56b8f285189440", "https://twitter.com/mysmallbusiness", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.249%2C$multiply_1%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/w_750/q_62%2Cf_auto/57c15e50c72b3749ceb20e7d8d56b8f285189440", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.249%2C$multiply_1%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/w_375/q_86%2Cf_auto/57c15e50c72b3749ceb20e7d8d56b8f285189440", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_1%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_672%2C$y_49/t_crop_custom/w_375/q_86%2Cf_auto/457ac014af331fd9789bd0fb8cdd3c979a9dfa44", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.249%2C$multiply_1%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/w_800/q_86%2Cf_auto/57c15e50c72b3749ceb20e7d8d56b8f285189440,", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_1%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_672%2C$y_49/t_crop_custom/w_800/q_86%2Cf_auto/457ac014af331fd9789bd0fb8cdd3c979a9dfa44,", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_1%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_672%2C$y_49/t_crop_custom/w_750/q_62%2Cf_auto/457ac014af331fd9789bd0fb8cdd3c979a9dfa44", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.249%2C$multiply_1.51%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/w_1600/q_62%2Cf_auto/57c15e50c72b3749ceb20e7d8d56b8f285189440", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.249%2C$multiply_1%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/w_728/q_86%2Cf_auto/57c15e50c72b3749ceb20e7d8d56b8f285189440,", "https://www.facebook.com/mysmallbusinessau/", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysmallbusiness", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.249%2C$multiply_1%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/w_375/q_86%2Cf_auto/57c15e50c72b3749ceb20e7d8d56b8f285189440,", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_1%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_672%2C$y_49/t_crop_custom/w_375/q_86%2Cf_auto/457ac014af331fd9789bd0fb8cdd3c979a9dfa44,", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_1%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_672%2C$y_49/t_crop_custom/w_728/q_86%2Cf_auto/457ac014af331fd9789bd0fb8cdd3c979a9dfa44,"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "emma koehn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alex mccauley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "startupaus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel munoz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T12:27:27.081+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d1f54077bcfbe50b60e361a41edf5f4c06fe0832", "url": "https://article.wn.com/view/2019/04/02/3_Indians_charged_in_US_with_visa_fraud_again/", "site_full": "article.wn.com", "site": "wn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.wn.com/English/keyword/america", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WN.com -

It\u2019s offering two-hour delivery in some markets, a speedy service few retailers are in position to match. And its popular, voice-activated Alexa devices and software have put it at the centre of the emerging trend of shopping via virtual assistants.\nThere is one important area, though, where Amazon\u2019s strategy looks much fuzzier: Click-and-collect. This hybrid of online and physical shopping is proving popular, and it could potentially prove a costly mistake for Amazon that it hasn\u2019t moved more quickly to get a piece of the action.\nA new report from Cowen & Co estimates that curbside grocery pickup will account for US$35bil (RM142.94bil) in sales in the US by 2020 as it is embraced by a greater proportion of consumers.\nThis is a model that\u2019s well-suited for traditional retailers. They are in a good position to scale up quickly, and they are doing just that. Target Corp\u2019s Drive Up service is offered at about 1,000 stores and will be in all stores by the end of 2019. Walmart Inc\u2019s grocery pickup programme is available at about 2,100 stores and will be in 3,100 stores by the end of the fiscal year.(1)\nBoth Walmart and Target say their net promoter scores \u2013 a key measure of customer satisfaction \u2013 are especially high for curbside services. And the click-and collect push is making a difference. Cowen analysts estimate that Walmart grocery pickup is contributing significantly to the retailer\u2019s overall US comparable sales growth. They forecast Walmart\u2019s US comparable sales will increase 2.8% for the current fiscal year from the prior year, and that grocery pickup will account for between 0.9 and 1.3 percentage points.\nIt\u2019s not that Amazon is sitting idly by when it comes to this digital-physical shopping mashup. It has two locations of AmazonFresh Pickup in Seattle, a drive-up spot for retrieving groceries. Its Whole Foods Market chain has rolled out click-and-collect services in 22 cities. And beyond the grocery segment, Amazon has a limited number of pickup centres and lockers. It all adds up to a smattering of tentative moves \u2013 not a cohesive strategy that can ramp up quickly nationwide.\nOn some level, it makes sense that Amazon isn\u2019t a leader in click-and-collect. It will be harder for it to make such an operation profitable when it is building its stable of pickup points from scratch (or via acquisition, in the case of Whole Foods). And I suppose Amazon could convince itself click-and-collect isn\u2019t an end game for e-commerce, but merely a bridge format that offers some measure of convenience before technology such as driverless cars, drones and smart-home entry systems make doorstep delivery \u2013 which Amazon dominates \u2013 more economical for sellers and more appealing for shoppers.\nBut there are downsides for Amazon in not more aggressively pursuing click-and-collect sales.\nFor one, even if click-and-collect fades as a format at some point, it is serving as an entry point to the wider digital ecosystems of the likes of Walmart, Target and Kroger Co, cultivating digital loyalty to those brands. It might prove hard for Amazon to elbow its way into a given customer\u2019s online routine once that relationship has been established.\nAnd there\u2019s a rather strong possibility that pickup is here to stay. It has particular appeal in suburbs, where shoppers spend a good chunk of their day in cars. Pickup, unlike same-day delivery, typically doesn\u2019t come with a fee, which may hold ongoing sway for budget-conscious consumers.\nAmazon obviously sees value in becoming a so-called multi-channel retailer, given its acquisition of Whole Foods and its reported plans of creating yet another grocery chain. But the window is closing for Amazon to develop a serious click-and-collect strategy that can compete with the maturing ones its competitors have already built. It should be moving faster to make this service more widely available via Whole Foods. Or perhaps it could even establish some outside-the-box way of adding pickup points quickly. Think, for example, of its pilot partnership with Kohl\u2019s Corp, in which customers can make returns of Amazon purchases at the department store.\nAmazon is such a formidable retailing force, maybe being an also-ran at click-and-collect won\u2019t be so terrible for it. But the e-commerce heavyweight will be better off if it gets more skin in the game.\n(1) Both retailers have additional click-and-collect programmes that allow customers to pick up online orders at a counter in the store. \u2013 Bloomberg", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "walmart", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "amazon.com inc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cowen & co", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T13:41:08.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "99d7fc9bc9cf01182e07540cf49d88d6f72f9515", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/three-indian-origin-consultants-charged-in-us-with-h-1b-visa-fraud/articleshow/68688242.cms", "site_full": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/rssfeedsdefault.cms", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "The Times of India", "title": "H1B visa: Three Indian-origin consultants charged in US with H-1B visa fraud", "title_full": "H1B visa: Three Indian-origin consultants charged in US with H-1B visa fraud -

In a blog post Tuesday, he said customers can tweak their orders at home or from their smartphone while on the go.\nThe voice-shopping service comes out of a partnership between the two companies that began in August 2017, one of several alliances Walmart has made in recent years with technology companies including Microsoft Corp., China\u2019s JD.com and Japan\u2019s Rakuten. But the Walmart-Google pairing hasn\u2019t had much to talk about since then, especially after Walmart withdrew from Google\u2019s shopping platform earlier this year.\nFor Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, teaming with the world\u2019s largest retailer could help its digital home assistant bridge the gap with Amazon\u2019s Echo device, commonly known as Alexa. It won\u2019t be easy: Amazon controlled 70 percent of the 66 million smart speaker devices installed in the U.S. as of December, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Google Home had just 24 percent.\nBoth Amazon and Google also face the challenge of convincing consumers to order by voice, which is tricky for perishable items like fresh salmon. Only 4 percent of shoppers use voice assistants for grocery planning, according to research from consultant Bain & Co., a fraction of those who own smart speakers. And those who are interested in voice-based grocery shopping already have other options: Rival Kroger Co. has unveiled voice-shopping capabilities through Google.\nGoogle\u2019s home assistant is available on devices including iPhones and JBL portable speakers, Walmart said. The retailer will also expand the service to other platforms in the coming months, it said, a signal that it may be working with Apple Inc. Walmart declined to identify other potential partners.\n\u201cWe\u2019re kicking off the work with Google, adding others to the mix as time goes on,\u201d Ward said.\nNow read: Alexa has 80,000 apps and not a single runaway hit Bloomberg Google Assistant grocery shopping voice assistant Walmart", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom ward", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "walmart", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google assistant walmart inc.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alphabet inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft corp.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon.com inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "walmart-google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T16:34:58.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6d80c2b8030255b52682380a13a435c9509a7133", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/nris-in-news/3-indian-origin-consultants-charged-in-us-with-h-1b-visa-fraud/articleshow/68689140.cms", "site_full": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Business News Live, Share Market News -

The new products give Amazon a greater reach than ever before. Updates to the internet giant's Alexa-infused Echo smart speakers will allow them to tend to microwave cooking and even have \"hunches\" regarding what users may want or have forgotten. Alexa is even developing a personality, complete with a favorite pet or beer. Here's a round up all of the Alexa-infused products Amazon showcased, including speakers, an in-car device and, a microwave: Echo Dot 21 Sep, 2018 The revamped Echo Dot has a new look, with rounded edges, and packs more punch, with a 1.6-inch driver delivering 70-per cent-louder audio than the previous model. The speaker has lower distortion and enhanced bass. It can connect to other speakers and other apps and devices over Bluetooth. Echo Sub 21 Sep, 2018 If you're craving more low-end tones from your Echo setup, you might consider the Echo Sub. It delivers down-firing, 100W of bass through its 6-inch woofer, and you can pair it with an Echo or two to create a 2.1 stereo system. Echo Plus 21 Sep, 2018 Amazon updated its Echo Plus, which includes a smart hub for a range of connected devices. This time around, it has revamped speakers and a feature called local voice control, which lets you adjust your various smart-home devices even if your internet connection is down. There's a temperature sensor too, so Echo Plus can tell smart thermostats to turn up the heat when it gets a little chilly. Echo Input 21 Sep, 2018 Not to be outdone by Chromecast Audio, Amazon has its own audio dongle called Echo Input, including Bluetooth, a microphone and a 3.5mm jack. It doesn't have a speaker, so you'll need to connect it to your existing audio setup. Next Google\u2019s home assistant is available on devices including iPhones and JBL portable speakers, Walmart said. The retailer will also expand the service to other platforms in the coming months, it said, a signal that it may be working with Apple Inc. Walmart declined to identify other potential partners. \u201cWe\u2019re kicking off the work with Google, adding others to the mix as time goes on,\u201d Ward said. 0 Comments Want stories like this in your inbox?

The company is rolling out a new voice-ordering capability, Walmart Voice Order, which works across Google Assistant-powered platforms, including Google\u2019s smart speakers and displays, smartphones, smartwatches and more.\nThe news follows several efforts by Walmart to enter voice-based commerce, despite not offering its own hardware or voice assistant platform, as Amazon does with Echo and Alexa, respectively.\nTwo years ago, Walmart and Google partnered on voice-based shopping through Google Home devices. Specifically, customers could easily reorder favorites through Google\u2019s shopping service, Google Express. However, Walmart disappeared from Google Express\u2019 marketplace this January, and was more recently said to be testing an online grocery voice application with a small number of VIP customers ahead of a spring launch.\nThe technology works similarly to what was developed for the Walmart-Google Express deal. For example, when a customer asks to order an item, the assistant will know to reorder the customer\u2019s preferred item based on their order history. The assistant will also inform the customer which item it\u2019s choosing and the price point.\nThis feature means the customer doesn\u2019t have to speak the full name of an item when making a request. Instead, they could say just \u201cmilk\u201d and the assistant would know they mean the \u201c1 gallon of 1% Great Value organic milk\u201d they ordered the last time.\nTo get started, Google Assistant users launch the feature as they would any other voice application. They\u2019ll say: \u201cOK Google, talk to Walmart.\u201d\nThat\u2019s still not as simple as Amazon\u2019s assistant, though. Because of its first-party platform advantage, you can say, \u201cAlexa, order milk\u201d to order from Whole Foods, or \u201cAlexa, add milk to my shopping list\u201d for future orders or general list-making.\nWalmart\u2019s voice app is meant to be used to round-up items for a later purchase by adding them to a cart, instead of forcing a checkout upon each new addition. This lets you add an item as you realize you\u2019re out \u2014 something that better reflects how customers use voice to shop.\n\u201cWe know when using voice technology, customers like to add items to their cart one at a time over a few days \u2014 not complete their shopping for the week all at once,\u201d noted Walmart\u2019s SVP of Digital Operations, Tom Ward.\nCustomers\u2019 tendency to shop in bits and pieces was one of the big oversights in the 2018 report that claimed voice shopping was a dud. It didn\u2019t incorporate into its findings one of the most popular voice features \u2014 list-making \u2014 and instead only considered voice shopping had occurred when orders were placed immediately. In reality, lists are a big driver of later e-commerce purchases but aren\u2019t as easily tracked.\nWalmart says the new voice-shopping feature will launch to all Google Assistant-powered devices this month, including Google Home, Android and iPhones, smartwatches and other platforms, including those from third parties like JBL or Lenovo, among others. The rollout will be staged, meaning over the next few weeks more and more customers will get the update.\nVoice shopping for grocery pickup will be offered at more than 2,100 Walmart stores and for online delivery at more than 800 stores.\nThe retailer says other platforms besides Google will be added in time, but that isn\u2019t likely to include Alexa, which today holds a 60+ percent market share on smart speakers, according to eMarketer.\nHowever, grocery shopping is a sizable business for Walmart, accounting for more than half its annual sales. Newer technology initiatives, like online grocery, have been successful with its customers, as well.\nAccording to a recent report from financial services firm Cowen and Company, Walmart\u2019s curbside pickup could generate $30 billion to $35 billion for the grocery industry annually by 2020 and that today, 11 to 13 percent of its customers use the pickup service.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sarah perez", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alexa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "walmart", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "walmart voice order", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google express", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google home", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T17:26:13.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ca0c1192818ac9dd8895faca7b6007ad844cdbb2", "url": "https://patch.com/new-york/southampton/s/go4ee/zeldin-lauds-allocation-30k-more-visas-meet-seasonal-need", "site_full": "patch.com", "site": "patch.com", "site_section": "https://patch.com/new-york/southampton", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Southampton, NY Patch - Breaking Local News Events Schools Weather &amp; Sports", "title": "Zeldin Lauds Allocation Of 30K More Visas To Meet Seasonal Need | Patch", "title_full": "Zeldin Lauds Allocation Of 30K More Visas To Meet Seasonal Need | Patch", "published": "2019-04-02T05:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "https://cdn20.patchcdn.com/users/1296254/20190401/090939/styles/T800x600/public/processed_images/zeldinvisas-1554167215-7355.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 465, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 14, "comments": 2, "shares": 7}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ca0c1192818ac9dd8895faca7b6007ad844cdbb2", "url": "https://patch.com/new-york/southampton/s/go4ee/zeldin-lauds-allocation-30k-more-visas-meet-seasonal-need", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lisa Finn", "published": "2019-04-02T05:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Zeldin Lauds Allocation Of 30K More Visas To Meet Seasonal Need | Patch", "text": "politics & government Shared from East Hampton, NY Zeldin Lauds Allocation Of 30K More Visas To Meet Seasonal Need \"The fight isn't over. Suffolk County businesses have experienced uncertainty year after year and they need stability and consistency.\" By Lisa Finn, Patch Staff | Apr 1, 2019 9:09 pm ET 0 (Courtesy Lee Zeldin.) EAST HAMPTON, NY \u2014 After an outcry from East End business owners worried that they wouldn't have enough workers to meet the seasonal demand, Rep. Lee Zeldin applauded Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, who decided to allocate an additional 30,000 H-2B visas for the remainder of 2019.\n\"However, the fight isn't over,\" Zeldin said. \"Suffolk County businesses have experienced uncertainty year after year and they need stability and consistency for the seasons ahead. I look forward to continuing to advocate on behalf of these hardworking Long Islanders so they can continue to grow their businesses in our community and strengthen our local economy.\"\nLast week, Zeldin met with local business owners in Westhampton to call upon the Department of Homeland Security to raise the H-2B visa cap, and to work toward a permanent, long-term solution to improve the H-2A and H-2B Visa programs.\nSeasonal visa programs allow employers to supplement their current workforce by hiring foreign workers on a seasonal basis; these foreign workers come to the United States legally filling jobs not already filled by U.S. employees in areas of labor shortage, Zeldin said.\nThe outcry came after U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services had already notified employers the 66,000 visa cap had been reached for the second half of the year for H-2B, despite the fact that many businesses locally and throughout the country had not received the workforce they needed for the furiously busy summer season \u2014 even though the local workforce just is not available in many communities, Zeldin said.\nHe added that he believes it is clear the current H-2B visa cap cannot adequately meet the demands of today's seasonal businesses, and DHS should lift the cap to provide certainty and stability.\n\"If you employed every single able-bodied person in Suffolk County it would still not be enough to fill all of the open positions these business owners have,\" Zeldin said. \"It is a great problem to have, when our local economy has more available jobs than people available to fill the positions, but it is imperative our employers are able to somehow fill their work force legally and immediately. Peak season is upon us and the Secretary of Homeland Security must utilize her authority to raise the cap to ensure Suffolk County businesses have the workforce they need for this peak season as well as stability and consistency in the years ahead.\"\n\"This program is the lifeblood of our resort town and many others just like it throughout America.\"\nOthers agreed.\n\"It's no secret that our sleepy little hamlet of Montauk has become a well-known and extremely popular vacation destination,\" said President of the Montauk Chamber of Commerce Paul Monte. \"Each year, thanks to our residents and loyal visitors, hundreds of millions of dollars in spending are generated just by the accommodations, food and beverage and retail industries in our little hamlet. Over the past 10 years it has become increasingly difficult to find homegrown labor to fill our seasonal positions, and now, with our booming economy and record low unemployment it is almost impossible. The solution to this ongoing problem has been the H-2B visa, guest worker program. This program is the lifeblood of our resort town and many others just like it throughout America. Without the seasonal workers provided by this program many businesses would be forced to scale back on their services or in some cases actually close their doors for good.\"\nThe agricultural community has the potential to be hit especially hard, many agreed.\n\"The workforce provided by the H-2A visa program is vital to enabling the farmers in Suffolk County to continue to feed our local communities,\" said Rob Carpenter, director of the Long Island Farm Bureau after the event. \"At every level \u2014 from the farms to the halls of Congress \u2014 it is critical that everyone understands what an important role this program, and the workforce it provides, plays in our communities and for our small businesses that are the backbone of our towns.\"\nWith the busiest season fast approaching, local business owners were worried that their hands would be tied and businesses crippled, explained landscape specialist Gordon Andrews of Hampton Bays before the event.\n\"Year after year, we experience the same uncertainty, which hurts the potential growth of our business and our local economy. If we are unable to fill these jobs with the available U.S. workforce, we must be able to fill them immediately through the H-2B program,\" he said.\nJohn Tortorella of Southampton thanked Zeldin for his vocal advocacy on the issue. \"As a business owner, the ability to provide for my customers during peak season is reliant on the workforce provided through the H-2B visa program,\" he said. \"In addition to lifting the current H-2B visa cap, there are vital reforms that must be made to the underlying program so business owners like myself don't have to worry about having the labor we need season after season.\"\nEast Hampton Town Supervisor Peter Van Scoyoc wrote a letter to federal elected officials recently asking them to address the concerns and support changes to help ensure that East Hampton businesses can hire their seasonal workers in a timely fashion, he said in a release.\nAccording to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services , the H-2B program allows U.S. employers or U.S. agents who meet specific regulatory requirements to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary nonagricultural jobs. A U.S. employer, or U.S. agent as described in the regulations, must file a Form I-129, or petition for non-immigrant worker, on a prospective worker's behalf, the site explained.\nFears escalated when word spread that USCIS, according to the site, was \"no longer accepting petitions filed under the temporary final rule, increasing the fiscal year 2018 numerical limit on H-2B nonimmigrant visas. USCIS will reject and return any petitions received after June 6, 2018 that were not selected in the lottery, as well as any cap-subject petitions. Petitions accepted for processing will have a receipt date of June 11, 2018. . . Only employers whose petitions were accepted will receive receipt notices.\"\n\"Three elements of the H-2B visa program are negatively impacting East Hampton businesses: the annual quota/cap on the number of visas issued, and the lottery procedure; the lack of an expedited process or exemption for returning workers, and \u2014 particularly this year, following the government shutdown \u2014 delays in issuing visas that leave business owners unsure of staffing until late February or March, or even later into the spring,\" according to the letter, which was signed by the entire East Hampton town board.\nClick here to find next steps for businesses owners that need information about H-2B visa applications.\nGet the Southampton newsletter", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-workers/h-2b-temporary-non-agricultural-workers", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A//patch.com/new-york/easthampton/zeldin-lauds-allocation-30k-more-visas-meet-seasonal-need&t=Zeldin%20Lauds%20Allocation%20Of%2030K%20More%20Visas%20To%20Meet%20Seasonal%20Need", "https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__uscis.gov&d=DwQFAg&c=L93KkjKsAC98uTvC4KvQDdTDRzAeWDDRmG6S3YXllH0&r=9hYrWT9A1wBh7n2h99LYVfVRnjhBBxzjLnhzQCqB-2A&m=9kyEb5ScU79QTrLBtCzRrqs53cf8v_AeWhOj7UiI9xo&s=IPV19Fr1nLZFFV0RAwBaZ-kwA8qWZk4AjxJLg0XR9NA&e=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A//patch.com/new-york/easthampton/zeldin-lauds-allocation-30k-more-visas-meet-seasonal-need", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A//patch.com/new-york/easthampton/zeldin-lauds-allocation-30k-more-visas-meet-seasonal-need&title=Zeldin%20Lauds%20Allocation%20Of%2030K%20More%20Visas%20To%20Meet%20Seasonal%20Need", "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u%3Dhttp-3A__uscis.gov%26d%3DDwQFAg%26c%3DL93KkjKsAC98uTvC4KvQDdTDRzAeWDDRmG6S3YXllH0%26r%3D9hYrWT9A1wBh7n2h99LYVfVRnjhBBxzjLnhzQCqB-2A%26m%3D9kyEb5ScU79QTrLBtCzRrqs53cf8v_AeWhOj7UiI9xo%26s%3DIPV19Fr1nLZFFV0RAwBaZ-kwA8qWZk4AjxJLg0XR9NA%26e%3D&source=gmail&ust=1554244072533000&usg=AFQjCNHjn_EsJfnvoBWeErWn9x1dON9dow", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Zeldin%20Lauds%20Allocation%20Of%2030K%20More%20Visas%20To%20Meet%20Seasonal%20Need&url=https%3A//patch.com/new-york/easthampton/zeldin-lauds-allocation-30k-more-visas-meet-seasonal-need"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zeldin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lisa finn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "courtesy lee zeldin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee zeldin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirstjen nielsen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "long islanders", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "east hampton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "westhampton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suffolk county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east hampton", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T18:20:46.044+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "53acd4d2fb4aff0e35c7e2e4a0c4baf5184db01d", "url": "https://patch.com/new-york/northfork/s/go4ee/zeldin-lauds-allocation-30k-more-visas-meet-seasonal-need", "site_full": "patch.com", "site": "patch.com", "site_section": "https://patch.com/new-york/northfork", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "North Fork, NY Patch - Breaking Local News Events Schools Weather &amp; Sports", "title": "Zeldin Lauds Allocation Of 30K More Visas To Meet Seasonal Need Patch", "title_full": "Zeldin Lauds Allocation Of 30K More Visas To Meet Seasonal Need | Patch", "published": "2019-04-02T05:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "https://cdn20.patchcdn.com/users/1296254/20190401/090939/styles/T800x600/public/processed_images/zeldinvisas-1554167215-7355.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 465, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 14, "comments": 2, "shares": 7}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "53acd4d2fb4aff0e35c7e2e4a0c4baf5184db01d", "url": "https://patch.com/new-york/northfork/s/go4ee/zeldin-lauds-allocation-30k-more-visas-meet-seasonal-need", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lisa Finn", "published": "2019-04-02T05:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Zeldin Lauds Allocation Of 30K More Visas To Meet Seasonal Need Patch", "text": "politics & government Shared from East Hampton, NY Zeldin Lauds Allocation Of 30K More Visas To Meet Seasonal Need \"The fight isn't over.

Without the seasonal workers provided by this program many businesses would be forced to scale back on their services or in some cases actually close their doors for good.\"\nThe agricultural community has the potential to be hit especially hard, many agreed.\n\"The workforce provided by the H-2A visa program is vital to enabling the farmers in Suffolk County to continue to feed our local communities,\" said Rob Carpenter, director of the Long Island Farm Bureau after the event. \"At every level \u2014 from the farms to the halls of Congress \u2014 it is critical that everyone understands what an important role this program, and the workforce it provides, plays in our communities and for our small businesses that are the backbone of our towns.\"\nWith the busiest season fast approaching, local business owners were worried that their hands would be tied and businesses crippled, explained landscape specialist Gordon Andrews of Hampton Bays before the event.\n\"Year after year, we experience the same uncertainty, which hurts the potential growth of our business and our local economy. If we are unable to fill these jobs with the available U.S. workforce, we must be able to fill them immediately through the H-2B program,\" he said.\nJohn Tortorella of Southampton thanked Zeldin for his vocal advocacy on the issue. \"As a business owner, the ability to provide for my customers during peak season is reliant on the workforce provided through the H-2B visa program,\" he said. \"In addition to lifting the current H-2B visa cap, there are vital reforms that must be made to the underlying program so business owners like myself don't have to worry about having the labor we need season after season.\"\nEast Hampton Town Supervisor Peter Van Scoyoc wrote a letter to federal elected officials recently asking them to address the concerns and support changes to help ensure that East Hampton businesses can hire their seasonal workers in a timely fashion, he said in a release.\nAccording to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services , the H-2B program allows U.S. employers or U.S. agents who meet specific regulatory requirements to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary nonagricultural jobs. A U.S. employer, or U.S. agent as described in the regulations, must file a Form I-129, or petition for non-immigrant worker, on a prospective worker's behalf, the site explained.\nFears escalated when word spread that USCIS, according to the site, was \"no longer accepting petitions filed under the temporary final rule, increasing the fiscal year 2018 numerical limit on H-2B nonimmigrant visas. USCIS will reject and return any petitions received after June 6, 2018 that were not selected in the lottery, as well as any cap-subject petitions. Petitions accepted for processing will have a receipt date of June 11, 2018. . . Only employers whose petitions were accepted will receive receipt notices.\"\n\"Three elements of the H-2B visa program are negatively impacting East Hampton businesses: the annual quota/cap on the number of visas issued, and the lottery procedure; the lack of an expedited process or exemption for returning workers, and \u2014 particularly this year, following the government shutdown \u2014 delays in issuing visas that leave business owners unsure of staffing until late February or March, or even later into the spring,\" according to the letter, which was signed by the entire East Hampton town board.\nClick here to find next steps for businesses owners that need information about H-2B visa applications.\nGet the North Fork newsletter", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-workers/h-2b-temporary-non-agricultural-workers", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A//patch.com/new-york/easthampton/zeldin-lauds-allocation-30k-more-visas-meet-seasonal-need&t=Zeldin%20Lauds%20Allocation%20Of%2030K%20More%20Visas%20To%20Meet%20Seasonal%20Need", "https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__uscis.gov&d=DwQFAg&c=L93KkjKsAC98uTvC4KvQDdTDRzAeWDDRmG6S3YXllH0&r=9hYrWT9A1wBh7n2h99LYVfVRnjhBBxzjLnhzQCqB-2A&m=9kyEb5ScU79QTrLBtCzRrqs53cf8v_AeWhOj7UiI9xo&s=IPV19Fr1nLZFFV0RAwBaZ-kwA8qWZk4AjxJLg0XR9NA&e=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A//patch.com/new-york/easthampton/zeldin-lauds-allocation-30k-more-visas-meet-seasonal-need", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A//patch.com/new-york/easthampton/zeldin-lauds-allocation-30k-more-visas-meet-seasonal-need&title=Zeldin%20Lauds%20Allocation%20Of%2030K%20More%20Visas%20To%20Meet%20Seasonal%20Need", "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u%3Dhttp-3A__uscis.gov%26d%3DDwQFAg%26c%3DL93KkjKsAC98uTvC4KvQDdTDRzAeWDDRmG6S3YXllH0%26r%3D9hYrWT9A1wBh7n2h99LYVfVRnjhBBxzjLnhzQCqB-2A%26m%3D9kyEb5ScU79QTrLBtCzRrqs53cf8v_AeWhOj7UiI9xo%26s%3DIPV19Fr1nLZFFV0RAwBaZ-kwA8qWZk4AjxJLg0XR9NA%26e%3D&source=gmail&ust=1554244072533000&usg=AFQjCNHjn_EsJfnvoBWeErWn9x1dON9dow", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Zeldin%20Lauds%20Allocation%20Of%2030K%20More%20Visas%20To%20Meet%20Seasonal%20Need&url=https%3A//patch.com/new-york/easthampton/zeldin-lauds-allocation-30k-more-visas-meet-seasonal-need"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zeldin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lisa finn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "courtesy lee zeldin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee zeldin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirstjen nielsen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ny zeldin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "long islanders", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "east hampton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "westhampton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suffolk county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east hampton", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T18:21:53.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0b346d709cf054800a01b33b9b2bb27ada115e4e", "url": "https://www.pcmag.com/news/367547/google-assistant-can-now-order-your-walmart-groceries", "site_full": "www.pcmag.com", "site": "pcmag.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.pcmag.com/Rss.aspx/SectionArticles?sectionId=1489", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "PCMag.com Latest Articles", "title": "Google Assistant Can Now Order Your Walmart Groceries | News & Opinion | PCMag.com", "title_full": "Google Assistant Can Now Order Your Walmart Groceries | News & Opinion | PCMag.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/567918-walmart.jpg?thumb=y&width=810&height=456", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 793, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5, "comments": 3, "shares": 11}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0b346d709cf054800a01b33b9b2bb27ada115e4e", "url": "https://www.pcmag.com/news/367547/google-assistant-can-now-order-your-walmart-groceries", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Matthew Humphries", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Assistant Can Now Order Your Walmart Groceries | News & Opinion | PCMag.com", "text": "News & Analysis / Google Assistant Can Now Order Your Walmart Groceries From any Google Assistant-compatible device you can now say \"Ok Google, talk to Walmart\" and then start adding items to your Walmart Grocery cart.

Terms of use .\nToday, Walmart decided to better compete with Amazon by collaborating with Google and allowing customers to order groceries using their voice through a smart speaker or their phone .\nThe new ordering process is officially called Walmart Voice Order and it works with any device offering access to Google Assistant. Customers simple say \"Ok Google, talk to Walmart\" and then products can be added to your Walmart cart by saying \"Add (product) to my cart.\" if there's multiple choices, Google Assistant will suggest what to add along with the price for you to accept or reject. The service will also take into account what you've ordered in the past to better predict what products to suggest.\nWalmart says you can use this across all devices with access to Assistant including smart speakers , smart displays including Google Home Hub , Android tablets and phones, iOS devices, and smartwatches . The service also allows you to populate a cart over several days before placing the order rather than having to remember to add everything all in one go.\nWalmart Voice Order is set to slowly roll out to more customers \"over the next few weeks,\" so if you don't have access to it yet you will soon. Walmart also suggests that Google is just the start and that other smart assistants will be gaining access to Voice Order in the future. As a retailer wanting to cater to as many consumers as possible, it makes sense not to limit this feature only to Google Assistant.

It is gunning for more dollars in high-margin categories such as home goods with a growing catalog of private-label items. It\u2019s offering two-hour delivery in some markets, a speedy service few retailers are in position to match. And its popular, voice-activated Alexa devices and software have put it at the center of the emerging trend of shopping via virtual assistants. There is one important area, though, where Amazon\u2019s strategy looks much fuzzier: Click-and-collect. This hybrid of online and physical shopping is proving popular, and it could potentially prove a costly mistake for Amazon that it hasn\u2019t moved more quickly to get a piece of the action. A new report from Cowen & Co. estimates that curbside grocery pickup will account for $35 billion in sales in the U.S. by 2020 as it is embraced by a greater proportion of consumers. This is a model that\u2019s well-suited for traditional retailers. They are in a good position to scale up quickly, and they are doing just that. Target Corp.\u2019s Drive Up service is offered at about 1,000 stores and will be in all stores by the end of 2019. Walmart Inc.\u2019s grocery pickup program is available at about 2,100 stores and will be in 3,100 stores by the end of the fiscal year.(1) Both Walmart and Target say their net promoter scores \u2013 a key measure of customer satisfaction \u2013 are especially high for curbside services. And the click-and collect push is making a difference. Cowen analysts estimate that Walmart grocery pickup is contributing significantly to the retailer\u2019s overall U.S. comparable sales growth. They forecast Walmart\u2019s U.S. comparable sales will increase 2.8 percent for the current fiscal year from the prior year, and that grocery pickup will account for between 0.9 and 1.3 percentage points. It\u2019s not that Amazon is sitting idly by when it comes to this digital-physical shopping mashup. It has two locations of AmazonFresh Pickup in Seattle, a drive-up spot for retrieving groceries. Its Whole Foods Market chain has rolled out click-and-collect services in 22 cities. And beyond the grocery segment, Amazon has a limited number of pickup centers and lockers. It all adds up to a smattering of tentative moves \u2013 not a cohesive strategy that can ramp up quickly nationwide. On some level, it makes sense that Amazon isn\u2019t a leader in click-and-collect. It will be harder for it to make such an operation profitable when it is building its stable of pickup points from scratch (or via acquisition, in the case of Whole Foods.) And I suppose Amazon could convince itself click-and-collect isn\u2019t an end game for e-commerce, but merely a bridge format that offers some measure of convenience before technology such as driverless cars, drones and smart-home entry systems make doorstep delivery \u2013 which Amazon dominates \u2013 more economical for sellers and more appealing for shoppers. But there are downsides for Amazon in not more aggressively pursuing click-and-collect sales. For one, even if click-and-collect fades as a format at some point, it is serving as an entry point to the wider digital ecosystems of the likes of Walmart, Target and Kroger Co., cultivating digital loyalty to those brands. It might prove hard for Amazon to elbow its way into a given customer\u2019s online routine once that relationship has been established. And there\u2019s a rather strong possibility that pickup is here to stay. It has particular appeal in suburbs, where shoppers spend a good chunk of their day in cars. Pickup, unlike same-day delivery, typically doesn\u2019t come with a fee, which may hold ongoing sway for budget-conscious consumers. Amazon obviously sees value in becoming a so-called multi-channel retailer, given its acquisition of Whole Foods and its reported plans of creating yet another grocery chain. But the window is closing for Amazon to develop a serious click-and-collect strategy that can compete with the maturing ones its competitors have already built. It should be moving faster to make this service more widely available via Whole Foods. Or perhaps it could even establish some outside-the-box way of adding pickup points quickly. Think, for example, of its pilot partnership with Kohl\u2019s Corp., in which customers can make returns of Amazon purchases at the department store. Amazon is such a formidable retailing force, maybe being an also-ran at click-and-collect won\u2019t be so terrible for it. But the e-commerce heavyweight will be better off if it gets more skin in the game. (1) Both retailers have additional click-and-collect programs that allow customers to pick up online orders at a counter in the store.

Save Nicole Lee\nWalmart customers once again will be able to voice-order their groceries with Google Assistant, another bid by the brick-and-mortar store to compete with Amazon. The retailer announced the partnership on Tuesday, and said it would gradually roll out the feature in the next few weeks. The development comes after Walmart unceremoniously left Google Express, Google's online shopping tool, back in January, reportedly to develop its own Google Assistant shopping feature.\nWalmart shoppers will soon be able to add items to their shopping carts by saying \"Hey Google, talk to Walmart.\" The feature will be cross-platform, meaning customers can shop from any device that has the Google Assistant feature, ranging from smart speakers and displays to their Android watch or iPhone. Google Home will keep track of your preferred brands at Walmart, saving shoppers some time. While Walmart offered same-day and next-day shipping with Google Express, it's unclear what shipping options Walmart will offer with the new venture.\nWalmart, which still maintains its status as the world's largest retailer in 2019, has aimed to claim some of the e-commerce territory already in Amazon and Alexa 's firm grip. Amazon has struggled to maintain its lead in online grocery ordering as companies like Walmart, Peapod and Instacart have stepped up their game. While 74 percent of consumers named Amazon as their primary destination for online shopping in 2017, that share dropped to 38 percent in 2018, according to data from the Institute of Grocery Distribution . Walmart expanded its online grocery delivery to 100 different cities in 2018, just as Whole Foods and Amazon partnered to offer 2-hour delivery in select cities. Sam's Club, a division of Walmart, partnered with Instacart earlier this month to bring same-day delivery to select markets.\nShopping on Amazon coupled with the convenience of a voice assistant like Alexa is a unique perk that, up until this point, the big box retailers couldn't replicate. Still, Walmart and Google have a lot of ground to tread if it wants to compete with Alexa. Amazon controls 70 percent of the smart speakers installed as of December 2018, compared to Google's 24 percent, according to Consumer Intelligence Partners . But with the new Google and Walmart partnership, customers who prefer the Walmart brand over Amazon's grocery offerings may choose to spring for a Google Home assistant.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "google assistant walmart", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "walmart", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "save nicole lee walmart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google express", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google home", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T20:03:08.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7a76fbdc05f7820e145bdf220e532ff7779c8e36", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/news/walmart-will-let-you-shop-for-groceries-using-google-assistant/", "site_full": "www.cnet.com", "site": "cnet.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["shopping", "media", "cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Walmart will let you shop for groceries using Google Assistant - CNET", "title_full": "Walmart will let you shop for groceries using Google Assistant - CNET", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.065, "main_image": "https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/PYZ6ZA9u3VRlkG092CrFr7s_DS4=/756x567/2019/04/02/3063b9b9-da5c-459c-8beb-1f9ddd69fad2/walmart.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 164, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7a76fbdc05f7820e145bdf220e532ff7779c8e36", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/news/walmart-will-let-you-shop-for-groceries-using-google-assistant/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Marrian Zhou", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Walmart will let you shop for groceries using Google Assistant - CNET", "text": "Walmart Voice Order lets users shop for groceries using voice commands.\nWalmart You'll soon be able to shop for vegetables at Walmart using voice commands.

Google Assistant has reached over 1 billion devices and is available in 80 countries and 30 languages. Those devices include smart speakers, smart displays, phones , headphones and more.\nWalmart has been beefing up its online grocery business as part of a push to become a bigger player in e-commerce and take on Amazon. In March, the retail giant started expanding its online delivery service to over 100 metro areas nationwide. It's expected to eventually reach 40 percent of US households.\nThe retail giant isn't the only player in the grocery market. Amazon bought Whole Foods for $13.2 billion in 2017 and has started offering its Prime customers in a handful of markets free, two-hour deliveries of Whole Foods groceries. Target bought online grocery delivery startup Shipt in 2017 for $550 million , adding to the competition.\nWalmart Voice Order can also reference grocery items that customers have bought before.

It is gunning for more dollars in high-margin categories such as home goods with a growing catalog of private-label items. It\u2019s offering two-hour delivery in some markets, a speedy service few retailers are in position to match. And its popular, voice-activated Alexa devices and software have put it at the center of the emerging trend of shopping via virtual assistants. There is one important area, though, where Amazon\u2019s strategy looks much fuzzier: Click-and-collect. This hybrid of online and physical shopping is proving popular, and it could potentially prove a costly mistake for Amazon that it hasn\u2019t moved more quickly to get a piece of the action.\nA new report from Cowen & Co. estimates that curbside grocery pickup will account for $35 billion in sales in the U.S. by 2020 as it is embraced by a greater proportion of consumers.\nThis is a model that\u2019s well-suited for traditional retailers. They are in a good position to scale up quickly, and they are doing just that. Target Corp.\u2019s Drive Up service is offered at about 1,000 stores and will be in all stores by the end of 2019. Walmart Inc.\u2019s grocery pickup program is available at about 2,100 stores and will be in 3,100 stores by the end of the fiscal year.(1)\nBoth Walmart and Target say their net promoter scores \u2013 a key measure of customer satisfaction \u2013 are especially high for curbside services. And the click-and collect push is making a difference. Cowen analysts estimate that Walmart grocery pickup is contributing significantly to the retailer\u2019s overall U.S. comparable sales growth. They forecast Walmart\u2019s U.S. comparable sales will increase 2.8 percent for the current fiscal year from the prior year, and that grocery pickup will account for between 0.9 and 1.3 percentage points.\nIt\u2019s not that Amazon is sitting idly by when it comes to this digital-physical shopping mashup. It has two locations of AmazonFresh Pickup in Seattle, a drive-up spot for retrieving groceries. Its Whole Foods Market chain has rolled out click-and-collect services in 22 cities. And beyond the grocery segment, Amazon has a limited number of pickup centers and lockers. It all adds up to a smattering of tentative moves \u2013 not a cohesive strategy that can ramp up quickly nationwide.\nOn some level, it makes sense that Amazon isn\u2019t a leader in click-and-collect. It will be harder for it to make such an operation profitable when it is building its stable of pickup points from scratch (or via acquisition, in the case of Whole Foods.) And I suppose Amazon could convince itself click-and-collect isn\u2019t an end game for e-commerce, but merely a bridge format that offers some measure of convenience before technology such as driverless cars, drones and smart-home entry systems make doorstep delivery \u2013 which Amazon dominates \u2013 more economical for sellers and more appealing for shoppers.\nBut there are downsides for Amazon in not more aggressively pursuing click-and-collect sales.\nFor one, even if click-and-collect fades as a format at some point, it is serving as an entry point to the wider digital ecosystems of the likes of Walmart, Target and Kroger Co., cultivating digital loyalty to those brands. It might prove hard for Amazon to elbow its way into a given customer\u2019s online routine once that relationship has been established.\nAnd there\u2019s a rather strong possibility that pickup is here to stay. It has particular appeal in suburbs, where shoppers spend a good chunk of their day in cars. Pickup, unlike same-day delivery, typically doesn\u2019t come with a fee, which may hold ongoing sway for budget-conscious consumers.\nAmazon obviously sees value in becoming a so-called multi-channel retailer, given its acquisition of Whole Foods and its reported plans of creating yet another grocery chain. But the window is closing for Amazon to develop a serious click-and-collect strategy that can compete with the maturing ones its competitors have already built. It should be moving faster to make this service more widely available via Whole Foods. Or perhaps it could even establish some outside-the-box way of adding pickup points quickly. Think, for example, of its pilot partnership with Kohl\u2019s Corp., in which customers can make returns of Amazon purchases at the department store.\nAmazon is such a formidable retailing force, maybe being an also-ran at click-and-collect won\u2019t be so terrible for it. But the e-commerce heavyweight will be better off if it gets more skin in the game.\n(1) Both retailers have additional click-and-collect programs that allow customers to pick up online orders at a counter in the store.\nTo contact the author of this story: Sarah Halzack at shalzack@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.net\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\nSarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

Suffolk County businesses have experienced uncertainty year after year and they need stability and consistency.\" By Lisa Finn, Patch Staff | Apr 1, 2019 9:09 pm ET 0 (Courtesy Lee Zeldin.) EAST HAMPTON, NY \u2014 After an outcry from East End business owners worried that they wouldn't have enough workers to meet the seasonal demand, Rep. Lee Zeldin applauded Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, who decided to allocate an additional 30,000 H-2B visas for the remainder of 2019.\n\"However, the fight isn't over,\" Zeldin said. \"Suffolk County businesses have experienced uncertainty year after year and they need stability and consistency for the seasons ahead. I look forward to continuing to advocate on behalf of these hardworking Long Islanders so they can continue to grow their businesses in our community and strengthen our local economy.\"\nLast week, Zeldin met with local business owners in Westhampton to call upon the Department of Homeland Security to raise the H-2B visa cap, and to work toward a permanent, long-term solution to improve the H-2A and H-2B Visa programs.\nSeasonal visa programs allow employers to supplement their current workforce by hiring foreign workers on a seasonal basis; these foreign workers come to the United States legally filling jobs not already filled by U.S. employees in areas of labor shortage, Zeldin said.\nThe outcry came after U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services had already notified employers the 66,000 visa cap had been reached for the second half of the year for H-2B, despite the fact that many businesses locally and throughout the country had not received the workforce they needed for the furiously busy summer season \u2014 even though the local workforce just is not available in many communities, Zeldin said.\nHe added that he believes it is clear the current H-2B visa cap cannot adequately meet the demands of today's seasonal businesses, and DHS should lift the cap to provide certainty and stability.\n\"If you employed every single able-bodied person in Suffolk County it would still not be enough to fill all of the open positions these business owners have,\" Zeldin said. \"It is a great problem to have, when our local economy has more available jobs than people available to fill the positions, but it is imperative our employers are able to somehow fill their work force legally and immediately. Peak season is upon us and the Secretary of Homeland Security must utilize her authority to raise the cap to ensure Suffolk County businesses have the workforce they need for this peak season as well as stability and consistency in the years ahead.\"\n\"This program is the lifeblood of our resort town and many others just like it throughout America.\"\nOthers agreed.\n\"It's no secret that our sleepy little hamlet of Montauk has become a well-known and extremely popular vacation destination,\" said President of the Montauk Chamber of Commerce Paul Monte. \"Each year, thanks to our residents and loyal visitors, hundreds of millions of dollars in spending are generated just by the accommodations, food and beverage and retail industries in our little hamlet. Over the past 10 years it has become increasingly difficult to find homegrown labor to fill our seasonal positions, and now, with our booming economy and record low unemployment it is almost impossible. The solution to this ongoing problem has been the H-2B visa, guest worker program. This program is the lifeblood of our resort town and many others just like it throughout America. Without the seasonal workers provided by this program many businesses would be forced to scale back on their services or in some cases actually close their doors for good.\"\nThe agricultural community has the potential to be hit especially hard, many agreed.\n\"The workforce provided by the H-2A visa program is vital to enabling the farmers in Suffolk County to continue to feed our local communities,\" said Rob Carpenter, director of the Long Island Farm Bureau after the event. \"At every level \u2014 from the farms to the halls of Congress \u2014 it is critical that everyone understands what an important role this program, and the workforce it provides, plays in our communities and for our small businesses that are the backbone of our towns.\"\nWith the busiest season fast approaching, local business owners were worried that their hands would be tied and businesses crippled, explained landscape specialist Gordon Andrews of Hampton Bays before the event.\n\"Year after year, we experience the same uncertainty, which hurts the potential growth of our business and our local economy. If we are unable to fill these jobs with the available U.S. workforce, we must be able to fill them immediately through the H-2B program,\" he said.\nJohn Tortorella of Southampton thanked Zeldin for his vocal advocacy on the issue. \"As a business owner, the ability to provide for my customers during peak season is reliant on the workforce provided through the H-2B visa program,\" he said. \"In addition to lifting the current H-2B visa cap, there are vital reforms that must be made to the underlying program so business owners like myself don't have to worry about having the labor we need season after season.\"\nEast Hampton Town Supervisor Peter Van Scoyoc wrote a letter to federal elected officials recently asking them to address the concerns and support changes to help ensure that East Hampton businesses can hire their seasonal workers in a timely fashion, he said in a release.\nAccording to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services , the H-2B program allows U.S. employers or U.S. agents who meet specific regulatory requirements to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary nonagricultural jobs. A U.S. employer, or U.S. agent as described in the regulations, must file a Form I-129, or petition for non-immigrant worker, on a prospective worker's behalf, the site explained.\nFears escalated when word spread that USCIS, according to the site, was \"no longer accepting petitions filed under the temporary final rule, increasing the fiscal year 2018 numerical limit on H-2B nonimmigrant visas.

They pleaded not guilty and have been granted bail by the court. Their next date of trial is May 13. Kishore Dattapuram, Kumar Aswapathi and Santosh Giri hail from the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and set up a consulting firm in Santa Clara in the US. The allegation against them is they set up Nanosemantics Inc and between May 2012 and 2015 submitted fraudulent H-1B visa applications. The Department of Justice in an indictment said this was \u2018in order to gain a competitive advantage over competing firms\u2019. The three of them were arrested on March 27. While Kishore Dattapuram, 49, was produced in the federal court in San Jose, Kumar Aswapathi, 49, was produced in the federal court in Austin. Santosh Giri, 32, was produced in the court in San Jose on March 28. \u201cAn indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt,\u201d the Department of Justice said. However, if convicted, the defendants face a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a fine of 2.5 lakh dollars plus restitution if appropriate for each violation of 18 USC 1546 (a) (visa fraud). They can also face a maximum sentence of five years in prison and fine of 2.5 lakh dollars, plus restitution if appropriate for the conspiracy count. The Department of Justice, US Attorney\u2019s Office, Northern District of California said a federal grand jury had indicted the three defendants in the visa fraud scheme. US attorney Adavid L Anderson and Department of Homeland Security, Home Security Investigations special agent in charge Ryal L Spardlin said there were indicted on 11 counts. The defendants company allegedly submitted fraudulent applications for high-tech worker visas. Their Santa Clara-based consulting firm provided services including placing skilled foreign workers at software and technology companies in the Bay Area. According to the indictment, the defendants worked together to submit the fraudulent H-1B visa applications so that foreign workers could obtain temporary authorities to live and work for employer in the United States. The Department of Justice explained that in order to secure an H-1B visa, an employer or other sponsor must submit an \u201cI-129\u201d petition to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. A petition and association documentation must confirm the existence and duration of the job waiting for the worker, and describe key details including wages. However, the defendants allegedly used Nanosemantics to submit I-129 petitions and obtain H-1B visas for workers that the defendants could later place at local companies. \u201cBy maintaining a group of available workers, the defendants could gain a competitive advantage over consultants that properly applied for paperwork only after matching a qualified worker to the available job,\u201d the Department of Justice said. According to the indictment, several of the I-129 petitions submitted by defendants started that particular workers had specific jobs waiting for them at designated companies when, in reality, the defendants knew that these jobs did not exist. \u201cFurther, the defendants allegedly sought the cooperation of third parties to conceal their fraud,\u201d the indictment said. The defendants allegedly orchestrated payments by Nanosemantics to at least one individual for permission to list his company as the employer for foreign workers even though Nanosemantics actually intended to place the workers else. \u201cFurther, defendants coached foreign workers and others, to respond to government inquiries in a way that would prevent the government from discovering the fraud,\u201d the Department of Justice said", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kishore dattapuram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kumar aswapathi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santosh giri", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nanosemantics inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa clara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "telangana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andhra pradesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san jose", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T01:00:30.056+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "640f161060d26b232fd856bfc9b3fb7638d33355", "url": "https://patch.com/new-york/easthampton/zeldin-lauds-allocation-30k-more-visas-meet-seasonal-need", "site_full": "patch.com", "site": "patch.com", "site_section": "https://patch.com/new-york/easthampton", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "East Hampton, NY Patch - Breaking Local News Events Schools Weather &amp; Sports", "title": "Zeldin Lauds Allocation Of 30K More Visas To Meet Seasonal Need | East Hampton, NY", "title_full": "Zeldin Lauds Allocation Of 30K More Visas To Meet Seasonal Need | East Hampton, NY Patch", "published": "2019-04-02T05:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.013, "main_image": "https://cdn20.patchcdn.com/users/1296254/20190401/090939/styles/T800x600/public/processed_images/zeldinvisas-1554167215-7355.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 465, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 14, "comments": 2, "shares": 7}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "640f161060d26b232fd856bfc9b3fb7638d33355", "url": "https://patch.com/new-york/easthampton/zeldin-lauds-allocation-30k-more-visas-meet-seasonal-need", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lisa Finn", "published": "2019-04-02T05:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Zeldin Lauds Allocation Of 30K More Visas To Meet Seasonal Need | East Hampton, NY", "text": "politics & government Zeldin Lauds Allocation Of 30K More Visas To Meet Seasonal Need \"The fight isn't over.

They are next scheduled to appear on May 13 for a status conference before Judge Edward J Davila, US District Judge.\nIf convicted, the defendants face a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution if appropriate for each violation.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kishore dattapuram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kumar aswapathi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aswapathi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nanoseman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santosh giri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dattapuram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giri", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "united states citizenship and immigration services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa clara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san jose", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T02:50:22.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ced99b4e307c233fe8d1b46429a1ff861a635416", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/2019/04/02/amazon-is-losing-this-35-billion-opportunity-to-wa.aspx", "site_full": "www.fool.com", "site": "fool.com", "site_section": "https://www.fool.com/", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "Fool.com: Stock Investing Advice | Stock Research ", "title": "Amazon Is Losing This $35 Billion Opportunity to Walmart and Target", "title_full": "Amazon Is Losing This $35 Billion Opportunity to Walmart and Target -- The Motley Fool", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/517957/walmart-associate-loads-groceries-into-the-trunk-of-a-vehicle-for-grocery-pickup.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1336, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ced99b4e307c233fe8d1b46429a1ff861a635416", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/2019/04/02/amazon-is-losing-this-35-billion-opportunity-to-wa.aspx", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Adam Levy", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Amazon Is Losing This $35 Billion Opportunity to Walmart and Target", "text": "Amazon.com ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) is the dominant force in online shopping in the U.S., accounting for about half of Americans' online spending.\nBut there's a growing area where Amazon lags well behind competitors like Walmart ( NYSE:WMT ) and Target ( NYSE:TGT ) . Curbside fulfillment for online orders is increasingly popular, and Amazon is hard-pressed to compete. Its main consumer-facing physical presence are its Whole Foods Market locations, which account for nearly all of Amazon's 520 physical stores in North America. By comparison, Walmart has over 2,000 stores offering curbside pickup and will spin up 1,000 more by the end of the fiscal year.\nA report by Cowen & Company estimates curbside fulfillment could generate between $30 billion and $35 billion next year. And while Amazon is working to compete, it's playing from behind -- and catching up will be extremely expensive.\nImage source: Walmart.\nGrocery shopping made easy The growth of curbside pickup at stores like Walmart and Target is a result of the fact that it combines the convenience of online shopping and the speed of physical retail. Customers don't even have to get out of their cars and go into the stores.\nWhile curbside pickup is still used by only a small percentage of shoppers, that number is growing. Cowen estimates 11% to 13% of Walmart shoppers use grocery pickup, and 14% of all shoppers used grocery pickup in 2018. The analysts expect the number of shoppers who have tried grocery pickup to climb to 25% by next year as the feature expands to more stores and retailers add more products available for curbside fulfillment.\nWalmart is adding 1,000 new stores to its 2,100 grocery pickup locations this year. Target's Drive Up service will be available at all of its 1,845 stores by the end of the year.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is lagging behind. It offers Prime Now on a few items in a few cities. Prime Members can order groceries from Whole Foods for pickup, but that's available in only 22 cities. Amazon simply doesn't have the physical presence to compete with Walmart or Target.\nShould Amazon invest in grocery pickup? Amazon's ability to compete in curbside fulfillment requires additional \"curbs.\" The company is expanding Whole Foods locations, and it's testing a new grocery brand . It can design the new stores with curbside fulfillment in mind, which could give it a significant advantage in the future. Walmart and Target are forced to build systems around their existing store and parking lot layouts.\nBut building and operating thousands of grocery stores is expensive, and the profits aren't particularly attractive. Supermarket profit margins float between 1% and 2%. Whole Foods, which specializes in organic food, had a profit margin of just 2.4% in the 40 weeks prior to its acquisition by Amazon. Not to mention that the cash outlay for buying, leasing, and developing real estate would be massive to reach a scale similar to Walmart or Target in short order.\nAmazon has never let costs stop it from seizing an opportunity if it's attractive enough. And the $35 billion opportunity in curbside pickup is more than 10% of Amazon's total retail sales last year.\nBut the opportunity goes beyond curbside fulfillment. Walmart and Target are attracting new customers to their digital properties. Cowen estimates 40% to 60% of Walmart's curbside orders come from new customers. That could lead customers to use the brick-and-mortar retailers for more online orders instead of Amazon, making curbside pickup a bigger threat to Amazon than just missing out on that $35 billion opportunity.\nAmazon needs to start experimenting with establishing and promoting curbside fulfillment in more markets to determine whether it's feasible. If it doesn't work out, Amazon will lose some money. But if it can establish a significant physical presence, the long-term potential could be very meaningful for the company.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-01/amazon-risks-missing-out-on-35-billion-click-and-collect-market?srnd=opinion"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "walmart", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cowen & company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T06:06:04.040+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6893d5629d3a184cadacaa7cb5deda53cefc78a2", "url": "https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/368657/visa-v-gains-but-lags-market-what-you-should-know", "site_full": "www.zacks.com", "site": "zacks.com", "site_section": "http://feed.zacks.com/commentary/AllStories/rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance", "mutual_funds"], "section_title": "Zacks Investment Research - All Commentary Articles", "title": "Visa (V) Gains But Lags Market: What You Should Know", "title_full": "Visa (V) Gains But Lags Market: What You Should Know", "published": "2019-04-02T00:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/default_article_images/default225.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8414, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6893d5629d3a184cadacaa7cb5deda53cefc78a2", "url": "https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/368657/visa-v-gains-but-lags-market-what-you-should-know", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Zacks Equity Research", "published": "2019-04-02T00:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Visa (V) Gains But Lags Market: What You Should Know", "text": "You follow Tale of the Tape - edit You follow Zacks Equity Research - edit What would you like to follow?
