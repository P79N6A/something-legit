It can be noted that Apple's biggest market China and even in developing countries, iPhone penetration is reaching its peak and India, seems to be the next big growth generator, not just for Apple but also to other big rivals such as Samsung , Xiaomi, OnePlus and Huawei, among others. Apple iPhone 7 produced by Wistron in Bengaluru. Apple Press Kit\nWhile Apple's market share growth has been pretty much flat in the previous year, it is expected to grow in 2019, as the company has already restructured the regional board particularly sales division and distributor partners. And now with the local assembling of iPhone 7, Apple will be able to save on custom duty taxes and pass on the benefits to the customers in addition to the improving customer service in India.\n\"Apple's older generation models still contribute to half of the iPhone sales in India. In a scenario of a price cut, iPhone 7 can be the new iPhone 6 for Apple in India by bringing in users whose purchase intention is driven by the strong aspirational value of attached to the Apple products,\" Tarun Pathak, Associate Director with Counterpoint Technology Market Research said to IBTimes India.\nCurrently, the cost of the iPhone 7 models\u201432GB and 128GB\u2014are Rs 39,900 and Rs 49,900, respectively.\nThe iPhone 7 assembling will also give impetus to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led central government's ambitious 'Make in India' initiative, as the latter the goes for poll seeking the second term in the Parliament.\nApple iPhone 7 sports a 4.7-inch retina display and comes packed with 64-bit architecture-based A10 Fusion chip with M10 motion coprocessor (It has a 64-bit 4-core. Dual-core processors which are 40-percent faster than the A9. Other two cores are of \"high efficiency\" and use 1/5 power to save battery life of the device and graphics processor is 50-percent faster than the A9 CPU). It is backed by 2GB RAM, 32GB/128GB/256GB storage and day-long battery (under mixed usage). iPhone 7, 7 Plus (PRODUCT)RED Apple Newsroom\nAs far as the photography is concerned, it boasts enhanced 12MP camera featuring OIS (Optical Image Stabiliser), F1.8 aperture, 6-element lens and Quad-LED True Tone flash. On the front, the iPhone 7 series houses an improved 7MP FaceTime HD camera.\nIt can be noted Apple's supply chain partner, Wistron's Bengaluru plant is having a positive impact on its supplier workers and the local environment. The company achieved Platinum Zero Waste to Landfill Platinum certification in record time.\n\"To reach platinum certification, a factory must divert 100-percent of its waste from landfill, with a maximum of 10% being sent to a waste-to-energy facility. The UL (Underwriters Laboratories) Standard is a rigorous and comprehensive standard for waste streams from manufacturing environments,\" Apple Supplier Responsibility Report 2019 states.\nIn a related development, Wistron has received an official nod from the Indian government for Rs 5,000 Crore investment plan. The company is reportedly setting up a mega mobile manufacturing plant in a 43-acre industrial plot in Narasapura (Kolar), 70 km from the Silicon City of India, Bengaluru.\nThere is a strong possibility that Wistron might start assembling of high-end mobile such as iPhone X or later versions in the near future at the aforementioned site. Industry sources have confirmed to IBTimes India that Wistron's new plant will also be catering to other mobile brand clients in addition to Apple in India.

PHOTO: AFP Reuters Apr 02, 2019\nBEIJING - Apple and other consumer brands lowered prices for their products in China on Monday (April 1) as a cut in the country's value-added tax (VAT) rate came into effect.\nPrice tags for products listed on the Apple's China website were lowered on Monday morning, including a discount of up to 500 yuan (S$100) for some of its latest iPhone models.\nSuggested retail prices for brands including Louis Vuitton and Gucci were also cut by around 3 per cent, according to local media reports.\nIt follows announcements last month from car brands BMW and Mercedes-Benz, which said prices for several car models would drop following the tax changes.\nApple declined to comment on the price cuts, while LVMH and Kering did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nBeijing said in March that it would cut taxes and fees for all companies by nearly two trillion yuan in 2019, with the manufacturing, transportation and construction sectors set to benefit as it looks to stimulate a slowing economy.\nThe world's second-largest economy is growing at its weakest pace in almost three decades amid lower domestic demand and an ongoing trade war with the United States.\nSeveral Chinese electronics retailers lowered prices for iPhones in January, discounting latest models by up to US$118 (S$150), after weaker-than-expected sales at end-2018.

Three experts weigh in on the buzzy new payment option", "text": "Got your iPhone? Your Mac? Your iPad , Apple TV , and Apple Watch ? Well, now the tech company wants you to have an Apple credit card , too. The Apple Card was announced during an event on March 25th, but it won\u2019t be available until summer 2019. Still, if you\u2019re into all things Apple\u2014or are just looking for an alternative to your standard, bank-issued credit card\u2014we talked to some experts about what makes the Apple Card unique. Even if you\u2019re a person who prefers not to pay for things with credit, credit cards have their advantages . And if you\u2019re already using Apple Pay , which allows you to pay for purchases with the tap of your iPhone (after you link your credit and debit accounts to it), the Apple Card might feel like the next logical step for you.\nSo what\u2019s the deal with Apple Card? First of all, Apple partnered with Goldman Sachs as its banking partner, and at an event announcing the card\u2019s launch, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said, \u201cApple Card completely changes the credit card experience and is built to help customers lead a healthier financial life,\u201d per CNBC .\nSounds good, right? But is the Apple Card really different from other credit cards? And how will it help people have a \u201chealthier financial life\u201d?\nHelloGiggles got the scoop on the new Apple Card from three experts in the world of credit and finance: Kassandra Dasent , a certified financial education instructor and personal finance consultant; Monica Eaton-Cardone , the co-founder and COO of Chargebacks911 ; and Daniel Gillaspia, founder of the credit card rewards blog UponArriving . Here\u2019s what they had to say about the product to help you figure out if you want to take the Apple Card plunge this summer.\nWhat is the Apple Card and how does it work? Gillaspia: The new Apple Card is a consumer credit card designed by Apple that runs on the Mastercard payment network and is issued by Goldman Sachs. You can apply for it through the Wallet app and it can be used (immediately) with Apple Pay on your iPhone with no physical card. Also, customers will be able to use a physical card (made of titanium) where Mastercard is accepted. It emphasizes simplicity and security in a way that other cards don\u2019t.\nWhat are the key differences between the Apple Card and other credit cards? Eaton-Cardone: The primary difference is that there\u2019s no need to use a physical card. While consumers can still use a physical card at brick-and-mortar locations, the platform is integrated into the Apple Pay mobile wallet tool and designed to work as part of that environment. The Apple Card also features a few unique security advantages. For example, the fact the card exists within the Apple Pay environment means there\u2019s no physical card number. This makes it more difficult to steal. Plus, the inclusion of a dynamic security code, similar to the \u201cMotion Code\u201d technology introduced by Oberthur Technologies a few years ago, can help further mitigate risk.\nDasent: iPhone users will be able to apply for the Apple Card using the Wallet app, be approved within minutes, and can immediately start using the card with Apple Pay. Apple Card has positioned itself as a no-fee card, which includes no annual, late, or over-limit fees, as well as zero foreign transaction fees. From a visual and security perspective, the Apple Card stands out. In addition to Apple\u2019s commitment to enhanced security for purchases made using an iPhone, a cardholder will only see their name laser-etched on the face of the physical titanium card.\nHow important are the added privacy and security features provided by Apple Card? Dasent: Given that identity theft is a prevalent concern, the Apple Card positions itself as a strong deterrent. The physical card will not include any numbers, such as expiration date, card number, or a CVV, but is available on the customer\u2019s iPhone. In the event the physical Apple Card is stolen, there is no ability to make fraudulent charges. Where Apple emphasizes its commitment to enhanced privacy and security is through the iPhone itself. Once approved for an Apple Card, the customer is issued a unique device number and kept locked. Each purchase made will require both the device number and a one-time use security code. Every purchase must be authorized by the customer either using Face ID or Touch ID. This process ensures that Apple itself is not able to track the where and what that was purchased, or how much a customer paid. However, it is still the customer\u2019s responsibility to secure their device with a strong and unique password to thwart other ways of compromising sensitive data.\nEaton-Cardone: In some ways, it\u2019s a great step forward for online security. As Apple Card is integrated into Apple Pay technology, consumers have the benefits of using the same tokenization technology employed by EMV chip [aka smart chip] cards. The tool also employs two-factor authentication: the user must unlock the device and provide a secondary form of ID, like a fingerprint scan, to authorize a payment. Of course, no tool is perfect. For example, a dynamic code won\u2019t matter unless merchants put emphasis on collecting the cardholder\u2019s CVV at checkout.\nHow does the Apple Card\u2019s \u201cDaily Cash\u201d compare to cash back from other cards? Dasent: As with reward cards offered by traditional institutions, customers will receive a specified percentage of Apple Card purchases referred to as Daily Cash. Where it differs to the rest of the industry where cash back rewards are paid out monthly, Daily Cash is added to the customer\u2019s Apple Card each day. Customers can immediately use the funds for purchases via Apple Pay, send cash to someone via Messages, or apply it towards their Apple Card balance owed.\nGillaspia: The new Apple Card isn\u2019t the best cash back card, but it does offer some unique perks. The 2% cash back is nice, but it\u2019s only on Apple Pay purchases, and there are some cards (with no annual fee) that earn 2% back on all purchases, so it\u2019s not exactly industry-leading. The instant cash back is a unique perk, though, and it\u2019s also nice to see so many fees removed from the card.\nWhat are the benefits of having a credit card through a traditional bank over Apple? Dasent: What most traditional banks offer with their credit cards that Apple Card has yet to mention are sign-up bonus rewards and additional perks, such as extended warranty and purchase protections and trip cancellation insurance. The other main point of consideration is that Apple Card is only accessible to those who own an iPhone.\nGillaspia: Traditional banks have more options to choose from and many have ways to transfer points out to travel partners. So whether you\u2019re trying to maximize cash back or points for travel, sticking with issuers like Chase, Amex, Citi, etc. are going to present you with a wider selection of lucrative earning opportunities.\nEaton-Cardone: Consumers may be turned away by the lack of physical bank locations. While physical outlets grow less and less important with time, many consumers still appreciate the convenience of a local branch office. Also, some consumers may be unable to completely transition to a new bank due to existing financial obligations. Mortgages and auto or personal loans can tie individuals to a bank in some situations.\nWhat benefits do Apple\u2019s partnerships with Goldman Sachs and Mastercard provide? Eaton-Cardone: Seeing Goldman Sachs and Mastercard attached to the Apple Card brand offers a few benefits. The first is legitimacy\u2014consumers and businesses know these brands within the finance and payments sectors, and seeing them attach themselves to this project builds confidence. Also, more parties involved here mean more consistency. It\u2019s especially promising to see Mastercard back this initiative; I\u2019ve been an advocate for more consistent standards in the payments industry for years, and collaboration between these companies could be a positive step forward, even outside the Apple Card brand.\nDasent: Although a new player in the consumer financial services sector, Goldman Sachs has promised that it will not share or sell Apple Card customers\u2019 data to third parties for marketing purposes. By partnering with Mastercard, it allows Apple Card customers access to stores and merchants virtually anywhere in the world and use of a payment-processing platform that is widely trusted.\nGillaspia: I really like that Apple/Goldman Sachs are committed to not sharing or selling data to third-party companies, which is a notable departure from other banks.\nMichael Short/Getty Images More What do you think of how Apple Card will calculate interest? Dasent: As with all credit cards, the Apple Card has a high interest rate. But where it differs is the wider variable range of the annual percentage rate (APR), between 13.24% and 24.24% based on \u201ccreditworthiness.\u201d This makes the Apple Card potentially accessible to a larger segment of the population. Those who have a high credit score will benefit from a considerably lower-than-the-national-average interest rate. On the other end of the spectrum, the higher APR will affect people with a less-than-stellar credit history.\nThe main issue is whether an Apple Card customer will carry a balance from month to month. For those that will, any cash back earned may be negated by the money paid as a result of a higher interest rate. Traditional institutions typically offer their best rates to customers with an excellent credit rating who pay their statements in full every month. Apple will do the same.\nThe Apple Card claims it will \u201chelp customers lead a healthier financial life.\u201d In what ways does its design help with managing finances? Dasent: What Apple Card offers is the technology to sort and categorize customers\u2019 purchases. It makes it easy for them to modify the registered business name of the store where purchases were made and view how much is being spent on items such as food or clothing. In addition, Apple Card will provide an at-a-glance spending summary on both a weekly and monthly basis. An added bonus which can encourage customers to pay off credit card debt more quickly is that Apple Card will offer several payment options, the ability to schedule frequent payments, and simulate the interest cost on different payment amounts. However, for those who struggle with credit card debt and overconsumption, the ease and simplicity of an Apple Card may entice some to continue with unhealthy spending patterns and habits.\nDo you see any downsides to a tech company like Apple offering a credit card? Gillaspia: Apparently, transaction data will be kept with Goldman Sachs and not available to Apple, so I\u2019m not initially worried about too much data being in the hands of a tech company, but you never really know. I think I\u2019m more excited to see a tech company playing a more integral role in the development of a credit card, since typically a brand\u2019s name is just stamped on a co-branded credit card. While I wouldn\u2019t exactly call anything Apple has done here truly revolutionary, it makes me excited to think about innovation that might occur down the road and what other tech players might get in on the action.\nWhat are things that consumers interested in the Apple Card should know before signing up?

REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company, filed for its debut international bond Monday with crazy high profits. The company made $111.1 billion in net income last year, according to Moody's, making it more profitable than Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet (Google's parent company) combined. Aramco is issuing a $10 billion bond to investors after doubling its profits in 2018 on the back of improved oil prices.\nSaudi Arabia's state-owned oil giant blows the rest of the world out of the water with its gargantuan profits.\nSaudi Aramco reported $111.1 billion in net income last year, according to Moody's, making it more profitable than Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet combined. It comes as the company filed for its debut international bond on Monday, a $10 billion issuance following a doubling of its profits after oil prices rose last year. For context, Apple's earnings shot up to $60 billion last year while Amazon brought in $10 billion in profits making Aramco's figures stratospheric in comparison. Similarly, oil majors Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell made profits of $20.8 billion and $17.5 billion in 2018, emphasising Aramco's sheer vastness.\nThe company's credit rating, A1 from Moody's, is tied to that of Saudi Arabia given the huge intrinsic links between the two entities.\n\"The company is wholly-owned by the state and is expected to remain largely under government ownership even after any potential IPO in the future,\" said Moody's. \"The oil sector also comprises a substantial portion of Saudi Arabia's GDP and dominates its exports.\"\nIt's the first major opportunity for investors to scrutinize the offering of one of the world's largest energy companies given the usually secretive nature of Aramco's disclosures. It's part of a transparency push on behalf of Saudi Arabia as part of a will-they-won't-they over the company's IPO plans which it shelved last year. One of the main advantages of issuing the bond is to gain high ratings from the various credit agencies. (Aramco doesn't need the money, after all.)\nAmong the key risk factors purported by the company are environmental issues and other climate change-related challenges indicating a broad understanding of the manifold demand constraints which face the oil and gas industry. Saudi Aramco produced approximately one in every eight barrels of crude oil produced globally from 2016 to 2018, according to the prospectus.\nOil prices were boosted last year after Saudi led efforts at an OPEC+ meeting secured supply cuts in an attempt to improve languishing prices by taking approximately 1.2 million barrels a day out of the market. Saudi Arabia is attempting to transition its economy away from hydrocarbons in order to diversify its oil-heavy economy and attract new capital to the Kingdom.

Her TED Talk from 2012 has racked up almost 52 million views, second only to this talk about educational reforms . She has since written a book, called Presence , and combatted negative press about her scientific discoveries--by doing more scientific studies . Yet, the talk only mentions the superman pose in passing. ( I wrote about it way back in 2015 when body language was a hot topic .) Her talk is filled with other tips, some of them not so obvious. Here are the best ones you can apply at work or in life. 1. It only takes a second Cuddy mentions how we read body language in only a few seconds. That's critical to know for those of us who think body language is more obscure or hard to read, or takes a while to analyze. I've been in meetings where I immediately know when someone is irritated. My wife can read my stress easily (apparently, I arch my back forward). 2. Body language is about being open...or closed Our body language sends a message, but sometimes the message is not so positive. Cuddy talks about how negative body language is also important, that we communicate our displeasure or irritation when we stand away from someone or fold our arms. Try relaxing your posture, unfolding your arms, and displaying an open expression. 3. You are complimenting, and not always in a good way \"Complementing\" means you are mirroring what you see, and this is not always a good thing, either. If someone stands with their arms crossed, and then you do the same, you are demonstrating to everyone you are closed off to ideas. 4. Power poses make you more willing to take risks The superman pose is helpful when you're at a conference and meeting new people. But it also helps you take more risks because you have a little more confidence. I've written before about the entrepreneurial personality , and the superman pose is all part of it. 5. Body language is mostly about you talking to you I found this point to be the most interesting. If we are communicating with other people at an non-verbal frequency, we are also communicating with ourselves . We're building our own confidence, sending off a certain vibe, and revealing emotions.

Apple will no doubt bring some of these features to its next flagship phones, but at least one has been all but confirmed by the always reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo this week in an investor note. According to Kuo, Apple will bring two-way wireless charging (also known as bilateral or reverse charging) to its next iPhone models, expected to launch this fall. Two-way wireless charging will let the iPhone charge other devices, such as the new AirPods wireless charging case, and all three models are said to have this ability.\nRelated stories\nA top insider just leaked the first solid details about Apple's 2020 iPhones\nApple is doing something in China it almost never does: Cutting iPhone prices\nApple's upcoming credit card is a lot cooler than you might think\nHere\u2019s a quote from Kuo\u2019s investor note, in which he notes that Apple is a bit late to the party:\nWe expect the new 2H19 iPhone models will support two-way wireless charging. Though the iPhone is not the first high-end smartphone to be equipped with two-way wireless charging, this new function could make it more convenient for users to charge the new AirPods and create a better integrated user experience of the iPhone and AirPods.\nAlso in the note, via 9to5Mac , Kuo says that Apple will increase the size of the battery in each new iPhone model to accommodate two-way charging. The battery in the 5.8-inch iPhone (the follow-up to the iPhone XS) will apparently receive a 20-25% bump, while the 6.5-inch iPhone XS Max sequel will have a 10-15% increase in battery capacity.

And Sir Richard Branson isn't shy about sharing what he thinks about this situation. \"The amount of holiday that people get when they work for American companies, I think, is something of a disgrace,\" he told a conference recently. \"How are you going to find any real time with your children or your partner, real quality time if you have, really, no holiday time?\" the Virgin founder wondered. As vacation-starved Americans know, that's a very valid question. But family bonding isn't the only reason Americans and their employers should think about moving more toward a European model of more paid leave . Science shows vacations are also good for the careers of individuals and the productivity of companies. Taking more vacation is good for your career. Even among Americans lucky enough to be able to afford lengthier holidays, many worry that taking too much time off will flag them as less dedicated to their work, harming their careers. That's generally silly, according to science. Taking more vacation actually leads to less burnout, greater advancement, and higher salaries . \"A small 2003 study took two groups of employees in the same company, one that took vacation and one that didn't. After coming back from vacation, the vacationers had the same level of stress as the non-vacationers, but much less burnout,\" Drake Baer reported on the Science of Us blog. That reduced burnout apparently leads to greater achievement. Another study of more than 5,000 Americans \"found that people who took less than 10 vacation days a year had a 34.6 percent chance of getting a raise or bonus in a three-year period, while people who took more than 10 days had a 65.4 percent chance of landing a raise or bonus,\" Baer continues. And it's good for your company. Worries about the career impact of taking more time aren't the only thing holding Americans back from longer vacations, of course. Quite a few of us work for companies that don't give us much -- or any -- paid time off. These firms might think their skimpy leave policies are boosting productivity, but, once again, they should check the research. The first clue that more time away might be good for output comes from economic statistics on productivity -- vacation-happy Europeans actually produce more per hour than workaholic Americans . Maybe that's because they're not incredibly burned out. Research confirms this connection between well rested workers and greater productivity. Here's the conclusion from one study written up recently for HBR.com : \"Employees in countries that take more vacation do have a strong desire to get a lot done as well as a tendency to move faster ... [More vacation time] results in greater productivity at work.\" Meanwhile, Stanford's Emma Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 points out that \"after a vacation, 64 percent of people say that they are 'refreshed and excited to get back to my job ,'\" adding \"another professional advantage from taking time off is a boost in creativity,\" particularly if your break is completely unplugged and/or involves time in nature . Is unlimited vacation vacation the answer? At the conference, Branson went on to tout his companies' unlimited vacation policy, as well as to offer tips on how to convince your boss to adopt one . But these programs can backfire as employees, uncertain and guilt-ridden about how much time is too much, end up taking fewer, not more, vacation days. So perhaps the answer isn't to shoot for the stars and go with a trendy \"anything goes\" vacation policy, but instead just to offer a bunch more days.

- CNET", "text": "April 2, 2019 3:30 AM PDT Celso Bulgatti/CNET So many streaming services, so little time. If you're tossing up between the benefits of Spotify over Apple Music, or vice versa, you'll want to know as much about each as possible before making your choice. Which is the best for iPhone or Android owners? Which has the most support for all sorts of smart speakers? And which has the most perks for subscribers?\nOf course, Apple Music and Spotify aren't the only ones to choose from. In the US there are at least six major platforms to choose from , including YouTube Music, Google Play Music, Amazon Music and Tidal. Some have bigger catalogs than the others, or offer bundle deals to get music streaming as part of another package.\nBut here's how the big two compare for streaming music. Spotify vs. Apple Music $10 a month or $5 a month for students $10 a month or $5 a month for students Family plan Yes, up to 6 people Yes, up to 6 people Free tier Up to 320kbps Ogg Vorbis, or AAC (see section below) 256kbps AAC Now playing: Watch this: Apple Music vs. Spotify: Music streaming battle 7:57 Price and subscription options\nBoth Spotify and Apple Music offer a free trial period for their premium services, which normally cost $10, \u00a310 or AU$12 a month. It costs $5 for students or $15 for family plans. With the premium version, you can stream any song from the catalog on demand, plus listen to songs offline.\nA Spotify Premium subscription will also give you access to Hulu's (ad-supported) video-streaming plan through June 10 at no extra cost. Spotify is also the only one of the two music services with a free, ad-supported tier , so even if you don't want to pay for the premium version you can still listen. The caveat (aside from the interruptions) is that many albums and playlists require you to listen in shuffle mode rather than sequential play and there's a limit of six skips per hour.\nApple Music only lets free users stream Beats1 Radio, or you can listen to songs from your iTunes library.\nWinner: Spotify\nThe free version of Spotify lets you listen to songs on demand, but many playlists and albums can only be listened to on shuffle. Celso Bulgatti/CNET Streaming quality\nIn terms of stream quality, Spotify uses the Ogg Vorbis format. On mobile you can choose what bitrate to stream, in increments up to 320kbps, which is handy especially if you're worried about using up too much mobile data. Desktop playback is at 160kbps or 320kbps for premium users.\nIf you listen on Spotify's web player or via Chromecast , it streams in AAC at 128kbps for free users or 256kbps for premium.\nApple Music streams 256kbps AAC files.\nTo find out more about bitrate and audio quality, read this in-depth comparison of sound quality between Apple Music and Spotify .\nYou can also adjust the equalizer in both to suit your preferences (although you'll find Apple Music's EQ setting outside of the app, within the Settings > Music section on the iPhone ).\nUnless you're a serious audiophile, you probably won't notice much difference between the highest-quality Spotify and Apple Music streams of the same song. If the highest audio fidelity is really important to you, consider another service that supports lossless streaming like Tidal.\nWinner: draw 10 Photos Library and music selection\nApple Music has a larger library for tunes, topping 50 million vs. Spotify's roughly 40 million. Both offer early access to certain albums from time to time and Apple Music sometimes offers exclusives for certain music videos.\nOn top of music, Spotify has a dedicated podcast section. Both also let you watch music videos and if you like something you hear in Apple Music, you can always buy the song or video direct through the iTunes Store.\nIf you turn on iCloud Music Library within Apple Music, you can access your personal library of tunes across all your devices (from the PC to the phone). This feature \"matches\" songs in your library with those in the iTunes catalog, or uploads them if the song isn't available, so you can listen to your music wherever you're signed in with your Apple ID. You can store up to 100,000 songs.\nNote that iTunes Match is also available even without an Apple Music subscription for $25 a year.\nSpotify also lets you play music from your device in the Spotify app, but it only works for local files (so they aren't stored in the cloud).\nWinner: Apple Music Celso Bulgatti/CNET Interface and navigation\nApple Music features a clean white look on mobile, while Spotify paints it black across its apps. Both are pretty easy to navigate on mobile, with the main tabs (radio, search, your library and so on) found at the bottom of the interface.\nDepending on the song, Spotify has animations and short videos that play full screen while you're listening. Both let you look at lyrics on screen if they're available for particular songs. But only Apple Music lets you search by typing a stream of lyrics to find songs you don't know the name of.\nGoogle Maps lets you listen to and control Spotify or Apple Music playback within the navigation interface in iOS and Android. Waze also offers a similar feature for Spotify users.\nOn top of CarPlay support, Apple Music for Android now works with Android Auto, so you can control playback through the infotainment system.\nWinner: draw Where can you listen?\nBoth Apple Music and Spotify are available on iOS and Android. Both have a standalone desktop apps for Windows and Mac, so you aren't limited to listening on mobile. In the case of Apple Music, that's iTunes.\nSpotify Connect lets you Cast to compatible devices and listen on AirPlay speakers (on iOS only). Celso Bulgatti/CNET\nYou can also listen to music in your browser: Spotify is at open.spotify.com . But Apple Music it isn't technically a full web player, it's more of a web widget at tools.applemusic.com .\nAnd you can also stream any audio to a Bluetooth wireless speaker, to an AirPlay speaker from an iOS device, or to a Chromecast speaker from an Android device (you can also cast from iOS if you have Spotify).\nWhen it comes to smart speakers, Apple Music with Siri voice control on Apple's HomePod and is now compatible with Amazon's full line of Echo smart speakers via the Alexa App (US only). It's also available on other Apple and Amazon devices like the Apple Watch , Apple TV and FireTV.\nIn addition to Amazon Alexa speakers, Spotify is also available on and Google smart speakers. And, if a device is certified as Spotify Connect compatible , it means you can use the Spotify app as a remote to control playback. Spotify is also available across a wide range of other devices like Xbox and PlayStation.\nWinner: Spotify\nBeats1 Radio. Screenshot by Lexy Savvides/CNET\nOne of the top reasons to use a streaming service is to discover new music. Both Spotify and Apple Music expose you to new tunes based on what you already like.\nSpotify has tailored playlists like Discover Weekly and Release Radar that are automatically populated each week with new songs. Apple Music has similar playlists, including New Music Mix.\nWhen you first sign up for each service, both ask you for your favorite genres and artists to get a baseline reading. Once you start listening more, each gets a clearer picture of your likes and dislikes to help tailor recommendations even further.\nSpotify and Apple Music also have radio stations based around your favorite artists, tracks or genres. Apple Music also has a separate station called Beats1 Radio which is curated and hosted by actual DJs, so you can listen to it in real time like you would a traditional radio station.\nIn our experience, Spotify's algorithmic recommendations for new music based on our listening habits is the most on-point. But Apple Music's human-curated radio station often uncovers new or unreleased tracks that also appeal.\nWinner: Spotify\nSpotify codes can be scanned with the camera to share playlists. Screenshot by Lexy Savvides/CNET\nBoth services let you follow your favorite artists to keep up to date with their posts and latest releases.\nYou can also follow friends. On Spotify, you can see what song your pals are listening to in real-time (if they choose to share this detail) on the desktop app.\nSpotify Codes are a way to share tracks, albums and playlists among friends. It's kind of like a custom QR code that you can scan with the camera in Spotify if you're listening in the same location, or share through messages if you're apart.\nMany popular musicians seem to be more active in posting updates on Apple Music and it's easier to find that content than it is on Spotify.\nNaturally, you can also follow your friends and see what they're up to across both platforms. While it's much easier to find profiles on Apple Music than it is on Spotify, you do have to already have your friends in your contacts list (or on Facebook) to follow them.\nWinner: Apple Music Which one is right for you?\nIf you want a free service, Spotify is the clear winner. But if you are looking to pay for a service, your decision may be a little more complicated.\nApple Music plays well with other Apple devices. If you want voice control on the HomePod, for example, Apple Music is your only option. Spotify, on the other hand, has greater cross-compatibility across lots of different devices, from game consoles to smart speakers.\nIt takes time to train each of these services to really get to know your taste. For our money, Spotify does a better job in uncovering and tailoring playlists and recommendations to us through its custom playlists and discovery features. But Apple Music gives you the most flexibility in mixing songs from your own library (that might not even be on streaming services) with new tunes you can stream on demand.\nOf course, Spotify and Apple Music aren't your only options for streaming music services.

( MJNA ), the first publicly traded cannabis company in the United States , today announced that its subsidiary HempMeds\u00ae Brasil will be sponsoring TEAbraco 2019 International Autism Week from April 1 to April 7 at the Iguatemi Mall in Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Brazil . \"As a company, we see events like this one as prime opportunities to educate the people of Brazil about the history of medical cannabis, the difference between hemp and marijuana and our cannabidiol (CBD) products and their potential benefits,\" said HempMeds\u00ae Vice President Caroline Heinz . \"In Brazil, CBD is legal to be imported and is even subsidized by the Brazilian Government for several indications including autism. We hope to inform people at the event of this because even though legislation passed a few years ago, there are still many citizens who don't know that they may already be eligible to receive CBD at no cost.\" In addition to sponsoring the event, HempMeds\u00ae Brasil will host an educational seminar on April 4 from 6:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. where attendees can learn about the medical cannabis market in Brazil , how CBD interacts with the body and the global landscape of medical cannabis. Executives such as HempMeds\u00ae Director of Medical Affairs Junior Gibelli , Endocannabinoid System Researcher Dr. Aliane Araujo , Neurologist Dr. Paula Vinha and Neuropediatician at the Albert Einstein Hospital Dr. Abram Topczewski will be presenting as well as taking questions from attendees. On April 5 , HempMeds\u00ae Brasil will host a CBD workshop lead by child psychiatrist Dr. Murielle Moura , who has a background in treating autism and other neurodevelopment disorders, for researchers and doctors to learn about how CBD interacts with the brain. The event will feature other workshops on April 5-6 with top international speakers and more than 400 lectures. \"Our Brazilian subsidiary is very active in the medical and scientific communities and has a strong background in providing the education citizens need to understand how to incorporate medical cannabis into their lives and professions,\" said Medical Marijuana, Inc. CEO Dr. Stuart Titus . \"Medical Marijuana, Inc. is very proud to be the first U.S. company to legally export CBD products to Brazil and, as evidenced by the company's participation in this event, plans to continue to be a leader in the Brazilian medical cannabis industry.\" TEAbraco 2019 International Autism Week will feature a well-rounded program of art exhibitions, free lectures given by top professionals and experts, presentations and demonstrations from scientific and medical researchers and training courses aimed at providing tools that families living with autism could use to improve their everyday lives.

ShieldSaver uses proprietary license-plate recognition technology to gather data on both cars and consumers, which can be used for several purposes. The most obvious is to identify when repairs are needed to approach car owners about getting the work done. But the data also has value to other stakeholders , such as insurance companies, parking-lot owners, parts suppliers and people buying cars, as it can give them a better understanding of both individual vehicles and the bigger picture. Efficient repair and maintenance work can have valuable knock-on effects. About SinglePoint Inc. SinglePoint Inc.

in China on April 1 as a cut in the country's value-added tax (VAT) rate came into effect.\nPrice tags for products listed on the Apple's China website were lowered on April 1 morning, including a discount of up to 500 yuan (RM 304 ) for some of its latest iPhone models.\nSuggested retail prices for brands including LVMH's Louis Vuitton and Kering's Gucci were also cut by around 3%, according to local media reports.\nIt follows announcements last month from car brands BMW AG and Mercedes-Benz, which said prices for several car models would drop following the tax changes.\nApple declined to comment on the price cuts, while LVMH and Kering did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nBeijing said in March that it would cut taxes and fees for all companies by nearly 2tril yuan (RM 1.21tril) in 2019, with the manufacturing, transportation and construction sectors set to benefit as it looks to stimulate a slowing economy.\nThe world's second-largest economy is growing at its weakest pace in almost three decades amid lower domestic demand and an ongoing trade war with the United States.\nSeveral Chinese electronics retailers lowered prices for iPhones in January,

Apple Tuesday April 2, 2019 4:00 AM PDT by Tim Hardwick A Swiss court has backed Swatch in a trademark row with Apple over the watchmaker's use of the \"Tick Different\" slogan, which Apple has argued unfairly references the Californian company's successful 1990s \"Think Different\" ad campaign for its own gain. Image: Swatch Reuters reports that in a ruling released on Tuesday, the Federal Administrative Court agreed with Swatch that Apple's \"Think Different\" was not known well enough in Switzerland to warrant protection, and that Apple had not produced documents that sufficiently backed up its case. Swatch has used the \"Tick Different\" slogan on its Bellamy quartz wristwatch with built-in NFC Visa payment technology. In order to successfully win the case, Apple had to show that Swatch's use of the phrase triggers an association with Apple products in the minds of at least 50 percent of consumers. Apple originally filed a complaint in 2017 over Swatch's use of the slogan, but Swatch claimed its use of \"Tick Different\" has its origins in an 80s Swatch campaign that used the phrase \"Always different, always new\", and argued that any similarity with Apple is purely coincidental. The \"Think Different\" slogan was created in 1997 by Apple advertising agency TBWA\\Chiat\\Day, and was thought at the time to be a response to IBM's slogan \"Think\". It was used in TV commercials, print ads, and several TV promos. Disappearance of the slogan in Apple marketing material coincided with the launch of the iMac G4 in 2002. Before the Apple Watch launched, Apple and Swatch were rumored to be joining together on a smartwatch, but nothing came of it. Swatch filed an application for an \"iSwatch\" trademark when rumors first began swirling that Apple planned to enter the market. It later managed to block Apple's own U.K. trademark application for \"iWatch\".", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tim hardwick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bellamy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "apple - macrumors swiss court backs swatch", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nfc visa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swatch reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal administrative court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T14:03:19.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "59b4c4038bc6733fbd22e0c79d7a10f849bfc2c8", "url": "https://www.inc.com/howard-tullman/every-business-is-a-data-business.html", "site_full": "www.inc.com", "site": "inc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "business_software", "business", "marketing"], "section_title": "", "title": "Every Business is a Data Business | Inc.com", "title_full": "Every Business is a Data Business | Inc.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_841844096_387880.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1265, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 9}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "59b4c4038bc6733fbd22e0c79d7a10f849bfc2c8", "url": "https://www.inc.com/howard-tullman/every-business-is-a-data-business.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Howard Tullmanexecutive Director", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Every Business is a Data Business | Inc.com", "text": "@tullman\nLet's get one thing straight at the start. Being in the data business, which is absolutely essential for every business today, has nothing to do with hiring data scientists and/or spending even more time and money on technology than you already are. There's nothing wrong with investing in your future, and new technologies will be an important part of that commitment, but you don't have to spend a fortune today to start down the right path toward a data-centric tomorrow. Because the thoughtfulness of your approach matters more than your actual assets. What I've discovered is that success is much more about determination--the desire to make a difference for the better for your business-- than about dollars.\nYou can also forget about A.I . and machine learning for the moment, as if anyone even knows what those terms mean these days. And please don't start sweating about SQL queries, GOOGLE analytics or any of the other buzzwords and jargon that you hear floating around. The most important thing to know is what's really important for your business to succeed and no one knows that better than you. Tracking and capturing the right information in a timely fashion and then communicating that info effectively throughout your whole organization is crucial. Silos, secrecy, and a reluctance to share are remnants of a long-gone era when only those \"in the know\" were supposed to know what was going on. Today, the more people who know, the merrier and the more likely you'll have a responsive and responsible business. Remember that sharing data is ultimately like exchanging ideas or lighting the next candle from your own. Sharing doesn't diminish the power and value of the original; it simply increases the illumination for all.\nSome of the best tracking systems I've seen for identifying systemic production and service problems, as opposed to one-off mistakes, are nothing more than collection buckets where repeated instances of specific and persistent customer complaints are sorted and aggregated. A framing store in my neighborhood keeps track of returned frames (sorted by the cause for the return) in simple folders and when a folder has half a dozen return tickets for the same concern, they know they have a problem that needs looking into and not just some random mistakes. This simple system lets problems be identified, quantified, prioritized and then addressed in an organized and timely fashion. Not a keyboard or a computer anywhere in sight. These programs are more about attention and time than about elaborate solutions or costly computer-generated algorithms and outcomes.\nSo, sit back and take a deep breath because, for the moment, all we're talking about is how you can do a better job of keeping score. And you can do that in a million different ways - expensive and fancy or quick, cheap, and easy. Most entrepreneurs prefer the latter. Especially because, in a time of constant change, deep and highly specific tech investments (especially those with a limited ability to flex) can be a real albatross and an impediment to your agility and ability to meet the uncertain challenges certain to be coming down the road. McDonald's, on the other hand, clearly decided to go big and just spent $300 million to buy Dynamic Yield , an Israeli data tech startup, to help manage and make sense out of all of its customer data.\nFor now, it's mainly about paying careful attention to and then attending to the things that matter most to your business and to your customers. And that starts with the old clich\u00e9: \"what gets measured is what gets done.\" When I talk about \"being in the data business,\" all I really mean is that you've got to develop systems that allow your team to define the metrics that are critical to determining whether and how well you're satisfying your customers' needs and desires. Growing sales and happy customers cure a world of potential problems and even serious shortcomings. But the measurements need to be practical and realistic and not feel-good factoids that don't lead to improvements .\nTo get started, you need to focus on the three main parts of the process: data collection; data measurement and the integration of the data results back into the business. Frankly, if you don't turn the data into facts and effectively share and communicate those facts to your team (at every level), the entire value and utility of the information you've gathered and analyzed will be lost.\nData Collection\nThe easiest and probably most accurate method of collecting customer data is direct from the customer. In some contexts (focus groups, political polls and opinion surveys) consumers who self-report may alter, enhance, mischaracterize or otherwise simply lie about their personal choices, attributes, demographics, etc. But in the world of e-commerce, where getting the correct selections is critical (and where \"fit\" is the most important factor), questionnaires, profiles, and other collection methods result in reasonably accurate baseline descriptions of the customer's needs. Newer methods, including a variety of gamified choice tools, are faster and easier and, as a result, generate far greater volumes of data and choices. No one has been smarter about gamification than Stitch Fix whose Tinder-like game feature called Style Shuffle is used by the vast majority of its 3 million customers to rate clothing choices every day. It has generated more than 1 billion customer ratings in just over a year.\nThe second level of aggregating customer data is from third party sources who are paid to append additional demographics, web activity and sometimes even purchase histories to existing in-house customer files.\nAnd the final primary source of data input comes from tracking and capturing all of the customers' online activity and other interactions with the company. Note that customer feedback (and satisfaction metrics) are not ordinarily regarded as an initial data source since these inputs are primarily gathered after initial customer activities and transactions occur and so they are accumulated more in the measurement phase.\nData Measurement\nAs consumers in general and customers in particular continually get smarter and better informed, they will demand more and more information about your products and services: what do they do, what ingredients do they contain (hopefully not corn syrup if you're a beer merchant), and whether there are known side effects. They'll demand to know where they're made and how they're manufactured. Too many businesses today don't know the answers to many of these questions and concerns and they aren't prepared to respond to their customers' inquiries. FAQ pages on websites don't get the job done and they're just as useless as the indecipherable and illegible labels stuck on product packaging.\nStep one in the measurement process is to know everything possible about your own products and operations and to have that data readily available and accessible. If you're selling clothes, you need to know every detail and dimension; if you're offering consumables, every chemical and component ingredient is now part of the equation; and if you're doing your manufacturing elsewhere, all those elements of the production and supply chain are now on the table as well.\nStep two is to build multiple channels and simple ways to elicit and encourage constant feedback from your customers - happy and unhappy - from Day One and to develop two-way and interactive communications with them so that they know that they are being heard. Help them be part of the process of making your business better and more responsive to their needs. Just to be clear - again from a technology standpoint - the more this part of the chain of connection and engagement is automated, the less successful and valuable it will be to you.\nStep three is to use the feedback to augment and empower your team to more effectively interact with and serve your customers. Every business ultimately is a people business and customer care cannot be turned into a mechanical process or a tool without losing the human connection and engagement elements that bring your business together and bind your customers to you. Only in intelligent one-on-one conversations (which can then certainly be documented and aggregated for other purposes) can you learn the true concerns, behavior drivers, decision points and other emotional parts of the purchasing process directly from your buyers.\nData Integration\nOnce the particular insights and ongoing guidance drawn from the collected and evaluated data are turned into actionable information, the real payoff comes from incorporating them into the day-to-day operations and especially into the company's efforts to project and anticipate the future requirements of its customers. There are basically four different areas where immediate actions can return rapid results:\n(a) decreasing friction in the purchase process and speeding up customer transactions, which will drive higher \"take\" rates and increases in average transaction revenues;\n(b) offering the \"best\" of your customers bundles, discounts, particularized incentives and other extras, which delivers a more personalized and customized experience, and enhances engagement;\n(c) stepped-up operational efficiencies in terms of inventory management, anticipatory restocking and repurchasing, and especially in terms of better targeting and fine-tuning the specific offers and products suggested to the individual customer; and\n(d) using all of the data to share customer preferences, choices and directions both internally for in-house product design and development and externally with brand partners in order to more closely align their own production and offerings with the needs and desires of your customers.\nThe ultimate goal will always be to most effectively use the information to enhance your employees' ongoing engagement with your customers, deepen your company's connection to those customers, improve the consistency of customer retention and grow your share of their spend while, at the same time, adding actual value for the customer in terms of speed, convenience, access and better decision making.\nIt's not an easy task, and it's an unending one if you're really committed, but, in the final analysis, it's all about visibility and vision - if you can't \"see\" your business, it won't be your business much longer.\nPublished on: Apr 2, 2019 More from Inc.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T14:25:54.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6f1bf67262d4b83320c116f01023705cc14d11cc", "url": "https://www.inc.com/julian-hayes-ii/3-unexpected-entrepreneurial-lessons-from-marvin-gayes-35-year-legacy.html", "site_full": "www.inc.com", "site": "inc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "business_software", "business", "marketing"], "section_title": "", "title": "3 Unexpected Entrepreneurial Lessons From Marvin Gaye's 35-Year Legacy | Inc.com", "title_full": "3 Unexpected Entrepreneurial Lessons From Marvin Gaye's 35-Year Legacy | Inc.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.071, "main_image": "https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_140955206_2000129620009280130_387589.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1265, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 6}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6f1bf67262d4b83320c116f01023705cc14d11cc", "url": "https://www.inc.com/julian-hayes-ii/3-unexpected-entrepreneurial-lessons-from-marvin-gayes-35-year-legacy.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Julian Hayes Iifounder", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "3 Unexpected Entrepreneurial Lessons From Marvin Gaye's 35-Year Legacy | Inc.com", "text": "@thejulianhayes\nMusic is a powerful entity that can captivate your emotions, change your physiological states, help you hone your focus , and can keep you dreaming for better on your toughest of days.\nTranscendent talents such Duke Ellington, Prince , Michael Jackson , Bob Dylan, Nina Simone, Miles Davis, Frank Sinatra, and Marvin Gaye are all still impacting millions of people today. Speaking of the latter, Marvin Gaye has been gone for 35 years and today marks his 80th birthday.\nAfter reading numerous books on him and listening to his music on repeat, I've taken multiple life and business lessons from him. Here are three lessons that you can take away from the late and unmistakable Marvin Gaye. 1. Step away from the comfortable and fight for what you believe in.\nThroughout the 1960s, Gaye was a hit-making machine with chart-topping songs such as \"Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing,\"\"How Sweet It Is,\"\"I Heard It Through The Grapevine,\" and \"You're All I Need To Get By.\"\nHowever, there came a point where he decided to break the mold and tap more into his artistry. Gaye had an idea for an experimental concept idea that consisted of socially conscious songs that discussed the Vietnam War, drug abuse, inner-city violence, and unemployment.\nSafe to say this was a 180 from the existing Motown formula which played things more on the conservative side. Gaye remained firm on his intentions and was even mentioning that he wouldn't record anymore if this record wasn't going to be put out.\nAfter enough persistence, the record was released and What's Going On was birthed.\nWhile you're not fighting with a record label, as an entrepreneur, there will be moments where you will have to have belief and persistence with what you're going after. This could be standing ground against family, friends, or industry norms among many other things. 2. Good things come to those who move with speed.\nIf you're anything like me, you have a reluctance to release products and services for fear of something not being perfect. However, much like I learned, and you probably did as well, through trial and error, there is no such thing as perfection.\nDelaying and \"tweaking\" is a sophisticated and well-dressed form of procrastination. Money loves speed and the world favors those who act swiftly.\nAnd when it came to Marvin Gaye recording 'What's Going On', it took a mere ten business days to record. For those a fan of rap, legendary rapper 2Pac recorded his classic ' All Eyez on Me ' in two weeks.\nBoth examples are powerful reminders that urgency and shipping rather sooner than later can lead to great results .\nApply speed and urgency to everything you're doing. Could you be making more calls or could you simply just release that project that's been simmering for way too many months? 3. Your troubles and heartaches can be used to create masterpieces.\nIt's no secret that Gaye was troubled inside which led to unfortunate events in life that panned out. While there were a lot of mistakes on his part, one thing he did masterfully was channeling his emotions into musical masterpieces.\nWhether it was the emotional gravitas and real-world heaviness from 'What's Going On' or the display of lyrical romanticism from his later albums, listening to his music made you feel something. He created a connection through many factors. The big one being authenticity.\nAs an entrepreneur, creating a connection through your products and services is pivotal. Many people sell digital marketing, health coaching, podcasting services, consulting, life coaching, and many more things.\nTherefore, to separate yourself from the sea of sameness, it's imperative to get the spotlight on your uniqueness. And one way to do this is to wear your emotions on your sleeves. Show your humanity and share some of your backstories.\nDon't worry about portraying a pristine online image. People buy from people they trust and more importantly, from people who they see pieces of themselves in (this can be an ideal version of themselves as well).\nGaye was one of the most prolific R&B artists of all-time who pushed boundaries most notably with albums such as What's Going On , Let's Get It On , and I Want You . While you're most likely not going to record a classic next week, you can extract the behaviors and habits that lead to classics being made and transfer them over to your specific domain.

DIS offers a compelling risk-reward when contemplating the probability of Disney+ success. DIS' future direct-to-consumer (DTC) success with Disney+ hinges on strong tested DTC IP and a superb track record investing and executing on plan. We expect DTC investments, along with the Fox asset acquisition, will return DIS to a double-digit earnings CAGR in '21E and beyond.\" Seaport Global initiated Lyft as 'sell'\nSeaport is bearish on the idea that millenials and future generations will ditch their cars for ridesharing.\n\"In our view, valuation is the toughest task with LYFT . Most investors are familiar with the brand name and the service. In order to justify its current market valuation, investors need to take a big leap of faith that the millennials and later generations will forego ownership of a car and opt instead for reliance on a ridesharing service. Despite the optics of vehicles being an underutilized asset, we believe people will continue to own their own vehicles as primary transportation and instead rely on the ridesharing services as a convenient supplement. While we believe the ridesharing market will continue to grow and expect LYFT to be a prime competitor, in our view, current valuations reflect an overly optimistic view of consumer behavior in the US. We initiate coverage with a sell rating and $42 price target.\" Deutsche Bank initiated Dow Inc. as 'buy'\nDeutsche Bank said that even though the chemical maker will be smaller than the old Dow, they believe it will be a better investment.\n\"With the separation of Dow from DowDuPont on April 1, THE iconic US chemical company has returned to the public market as an independent company after a brief 19-month hiatus following the merger of Dow and DuPont in '17. While \"New\" Dow is smaller than \"Old\" Dow, having combined its $6B (in sales) Ag business with DuPont's Ag business and shifting $8B of its highest margin specialty sales to DuPont, overall we believe \"New\" Dow will be a better company (and investment) than \"Old\" Dow. With an attractive dividend yield of 5.2%, we initiate coverage with a Buy rating and a price target of $62, with upside potential of 16%.\" Deutsche Bank initiated Intuitive Surgical as 'buy'\nDeutsche Bank said Intuitive Surgical which develops robotic-assisted technologies, tools and services for surgery, has \"best-in-class pro\ufb01tability.\"\n\" Intuitive Surgical is the dominant global leader in robotic surgery and, in our view, one of the premier medtech growth stories: durable premium revenue growth with best-in-class pro\ufb01tability despite the major step-up in investment in 2019 that belies the company's true earnings power. A still-underpenetrated worldwide surgery market leaves substantial runway for continued robust sales growth, with technology innovation \u2013 including two novel new robotic systems now in early commercialization and a steady \ufb02ow of new instruments \u2013 continuing to drive both penetration of established procedure categories and addressable market expansion. While competitor surgical robot launches are likely on the horizon and cannot be overlooked, we think Intuitive's market leadership is sustainable in light of myriad important competitive advantages enumerated herein.\" Jefferies upgraded Lab Corp & Quest Diagnostics to 'buy' from 'hold'\nJefferies said the clinical laboratory companies should benefit from the debut of their preferred lab networks.\n\"We are upgrading DGX & LH given our belief that UNH 's upcoming rollout of its preferred lab network is a positive catalyst for both stocks, as their likely inclusion should bolster organic growth beginning in 2020. With 2019 outlooks (incl. Q1) seemingly de-risked with fairly conservative guidance ranges and 2020 Street estimates looking conservative, DGX's and LH's valuations, at below-historical relative averages make both stocks compelling.\" Deutsche Bank upgraded Hostess Brands to 'buy' from 'hold'\nDeutsche said the maker of Twinkies could return to \"top-tier\" revenue growth this year.\n\"Since our May 2018 downgrade, TWNK has declined ~7% while the XLP has appreciated ~13%. Walmart merchandising issues, Chicago bakery margin/mix headwinds, and general cost inflation have all driven fundamental underperformance relative to peers, as revenue growth decelerated and margin contracted at Hostess. As we said coming out of our management meetings in September, after Q3'18 results in November, ahead of Q4'18 results in February, and after the recent CAGNY lunch in March, the pressures faced in 2018 could easily become tailwinds in 2019, however. If management can execute effectively, all while the Walmart merchandising issue laps, Chicago bakery finally turns profitable, and improved pricing helps to offset freight, commodity, and wage inflation, then we could (and should) have a Hostess this year that returns to top-tier revenue growth in the U.S., all while expanding margins nicely.\" Michael Bloom Senior Talent Producer Related Securities", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bob iger", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rosenblatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "disney", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lyft", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dow inc.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "the walt disney company", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seaport global", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosenblatt securities", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T14:51:49.116+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "60839fdbbf31b44cd986b6e775377d8961ddb8f3", "url": "https://www.inc.com/wanda-thibodeaux/how-to-listen-to-a-speech-so-you-actually-learn-something.html", "site_full": "www.inc.com", "site": "inc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "business_software", "business", "marketing"], "section_title": "", "title": "How to Listen to a Speech So You Actually Learn Something | Inc.com", "title_full": "How to Listen to a Speech So You Actually Learn Something | Inc.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_490995396_2000150020009280198_382228.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1265, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "60839fdbbf31b44cd986b6e775377d8961ddb8f3", "url": "https://www.inc.com/wanda-thibodeaux/how-to-listen-to-a-speech-so-you-actually-learn-something.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Wanda Thibodeauxcopywriter", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to Listen to a Speech So You Actually Learn Something | Inc.com", "text": "@WandaThibodeaux\nIf you're worth your salt as a leader, you'll probably have to get up in front of others and talk at some point. But equally important is listening to others give speeches . Every time you do this, you should listen for a few key components that signal that the presentation is worth your time and cognitive energy. 1. What everybody's going to get\nIn a great speech, the intended gains for both the speaker and audience are clear, ideally framed in the first few moments of the address. You should be able to answer, \"What does the speaker want for themselves?\" and \"What does the speaker want for me?\"\nA great example is Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s I Have a Dream speech . The central ideas of freedom and equality are reiterated throughout, and while King describes what he dreams for Negros and the collective people of the United States, he also makes it personal by talking of how his own four children might live in the better world. 2. Emotional energy\nWhile we usually associate speeches with upbeat motivation, speakers can try to drive their points home through a full range of emotional connections. The feelings a speaker attempts to engage, usually by stories, can give significant history about the speaker. But they also say tons about the assumptions the speaker has about the people in the audience. Ask yourself not only what those assumptions might be, but also what the underlying purpose is for getting the audience into that emotional state.\nWhatever the emotion, it should be obvious and consistent in the speaker's vocal tone, expressions and body language. This is a huge signal about the speaker's authenticity. While some emotional pleas might warrant awed or respectful silence from listeners, you usually can tell that emotional energy is high by the spontaneity and vigor the audience responds with. 3. Slowness\nSpeech tends to quicken if you are overly excited, stressed or nervous. A speech with a super fast rate of talking thus can make listeners think the speaker is not trustworthy or prepared. By contrast, slower speeches have a calming effect and offer the listener more time to comprehend what's being said. 4. Proper lingo and word choice\nIn some instances, such as King's speech, an abstract concept (e.g., freedom) will be central to the speaker's main point. But the speech itself should be conveyed with simpler, digestible ideas and action verbs. For example, King masterfully uses simile and other tools to help listeners \"see\" his vision. He describes the Negro situation with concrete-based phrases like \" bank of justice\", \"bad check \" and \" vault of opportunity\" and says civil rights supporters won't be satisfied until \"justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream .\" Steve Jobs also knew simplicity and concreteness mattered. He routinely used language judged appropriate for third graders . 5. Facts and figures\nThis doesn't always mean a bunch of statistics. It simply means that the speaker gives you relevant information that you can verify on the spot or later. Being able to determine whether what the speaker says is true or false tells you whether they are credible and establishes trust. It also usually communicates that the speaker has prepared well to understand their topic, provided that they've kept the information within the proper contexts. Whatever the data set happens to be, it should match the emotional message the speaker tries to convey and support the assertions made about how everyone can take benefit at the end of the day. It shouldn't merely repeat or confirm what the audience already knows. 6. Next step(s)\nFeeling emotionally charged based on truthful information that can yield real benefits is fabulous. But what do you do with it all? The best speeches don't leave you there as a mere absorber. They also show you how to get involved or what to do after the speech is over. This moves you from being a passive outsider to being an active part of the speaker's group.\nSome of the most exaggerated examples of this might be in the ancient speeches kings and other leaders would give their armies before battle. These leaders energized those under their command by painting pictures of their warriors charging the field, capturing heads and committing other acts of notorious victory. The warriors not only knew what to do, but could envision themselves beforehand having success.\nEven today, calls to action--for example, someone asking you to march to the capital building for your state or to take 5 extra minutes a day for yourself--routinely serve to wrap up good talks. If the call is for you to persevere, the speaker still should make it clear how to do so. Published on: Apr 2, 2019 More from Inc.

Share Via Email Published: 02nd April 2019 01:46 PM | Last Updated: 02nd April 2019 04:09 PM | A+ A A- For representational purposes. By IANS\nNEW DELHI: Giving an impetus to its India manufacturing plans, Apple has started the assembling of iPhone 7 at its supplier Wistron's facility in Bengaluru. Taiwanese industrial major Wistron already assembles iPhone 6S in the country. \"We are proud to be producing iPhone 7 in Bengaluru for our local customers furthering our long-term commitment in India,\" Apple said on Tuesday. The assembling of iPhone 7 began last month. Wistron, which last year announced plans to invest Rs 3,000 crore in the Narasupra industrial sector in Karnataka's Kolar district, started Apple operations with assembling low-end iPhone SE and later iPhone 6S. According to Wistron India head Gururaj A, the company would set up an iPhone making unit in the 43 acres of land allotted to it, with employment potential of over 10,000 people. The new Wistron facility is also set to manufacture a wider range of Apple's devices. Apple is slowly but steadily strategising its plans to make deeper inroads in a country where over 450 million people use smartphones, and assembling iPhone 7 is another step towards gaining more ground. According to Tarun Pathak, Associate Director at Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Research, the Indian electronics market is growing fast and has gained a significant advantage on some of the competing countries.\"I think to start with, it makes sense for Apple to localise assembling of models that have the potential to scale up and then slowly expands it to entire portfolio,\" Pathak said. iPhone 7 runs iOS 12, is water-resistant and houses a 12MP camera, Retina HD display, great battery life and stereo speakers. The 32GB iPhone 7 costs Rs 39,900 while the 128GB variant Rs 49,900. In India, price is a key factor when it comes to buying a smartphone. Apple has already begun reducing the price of iPhones in China and may go the same way in India where the iPhone is considered expensive. According to a report in Caixin on Monday, Apple has cut prices for several of its products including iPhones. For the first time this year, Apple has dropped iPhone prices on its official Chinese website.\"The slash comes in response to China's reduction of the tax burden for manufacturing and other sectors that began on April 1,\" the report said. The iPhone maker is also seeking tax relief and other incentives to begin assembling more handsets and open its branded stores in India.

This hat is often one that doesn't go over very well in meetings. It's the one that plays the devil's advocate and asks the questions that no one else wants to ask. What Is A Hat? A \"hat\" is not a physical piece of clothing, but a state of mind. It is a tool that can be used to push the boundaries of thinking and help you grow as a group and as leaders. You can think of a hat discussion as a movement, NOT an argument. It's not about asking questions like: \"Is this correct? Do I agree/disagree?\" Instead ask yourself: \"Where does this idea take us?\" Black Hat: Your Protective Counterpoint When you wear your black hat during meetings or mastermind groups your job is to focus exclusively on what is wrong or could go wrong. This is the hat that deals with cautious risk assessment and wants to protect you from pain. It cares most about survival and keeping you safe by looking for what's wrong. This is the \"traditional\" western critical thinker. It anticipates obstacles and kills bad ideas before they get you into trouble. A word of caution here: wear this hat for very short spurts of time. There is a fine line between killing ideas or good ideas that have simply not been fully flushed out. Questions to Ask While Wearing the Black Hat: What is wrong here? How could this come back to haunt you? What are risks here? How would a skeptical thinker see this proposal? Why should we say no? Key Descriptive Phrases To Help With the Process: Skeptical skeptic Devil's advocate Why Should You Wear The Black Hat? In most cases playing the Devil's advocate isn't a popular choice during meetings and mastermind sessions. Which is exactly why it's so important to fuel future growth. A few minutes of a black hat session can help you in several ways. Prevent you from doing something stupid or costly or painful... Layout the landmines and pitfalls onto the map so that you can plan to avoid them Push you to come with even better solutions and clearer thinking Important Things To Remember About The Black Hat When playing Devil's advocate during a business meeting, it's important to remember that it's not about winning an argument or having an excuse to argue. The goal is to pinpoint areas of weakness to allow yourself to plan for all possible outcomes. Wear the hat for a few minutes at a time, and then move onto other thought exercises. Spending too much time thinking of all the negative things that could happen can quickly change the tone of your meeting if you aren't careful. Always be logical and not emotional (otherwise it's under the red hat ). Model Black Hat Thinkers: An attorney you are consulting with A police officer on patrol The captain of the guard Warf Chief of staff In black hat thinking, parallel thinking becomes critical... when people bring up conflicting black hat ideas, simply put them both down and move forward in your thinking. Only choose between the two if you absolutely have to, and usually you don't, at least not during the black hat part of your thinking.

Given how quickly the business landscape changes these days, making decisions that impact the future of a company without knowing the future context for those decisions can be a seriously daunting prospect. Enter: Concentric . The simulation software company has set out to solve the business forecasting problem, enabling business leaders to navigate uncertainty and avoid decision fails in the process. They're doing it via the power of simulation at a speed that's virtually unprecedented. Since its software launch, Concentric has grown 100 percent year over year--a stat that speaks to the level of demand for this kind of product. To date, Concentric has worked with more than 100 Fortune 500 companies, answered more than 100,000 questions, and informed more than $20 billion in investment decisions. Here's how the company is using rapid-fire simulation to transform the landscape of business analytics. Solving Two Major Business Problems \"Concentric really set out to solve two problems,\" says Concentric VP of Marketing Melissa Todisco. \"There's a business problem and there's an analytics problem.\" On the business side of things, companies are under increasing pressure to figure out how to navigate an ever-changing landscape. \"There's more volatility in the market, and business leaders are under pressure to figure out, 'What do I do and how do I avoid a decision fail and things not going right for my business?',\" Todisco says. When it comes to analytics, she says, \"There's a gap in the ability to be able to accurately and quickly forecast and look at what's going to happen in the future.\" Most analytics tools exclusively offer historical or present-day information about key data such as website traffic, conversions, market trends , and so on. And while simulation as a concept isn't new, there are very few tools that deliver quick and accurate forecasting. \"Historically, simulation was a slow, manual process,\" Todisco says. \"With machine learning and cloud computing , we're able to make [fast forecasting] available to business leaders.\" Rather than waiting months for future-focused insights, Concentric's users can obtain answers to their most pressing questions in a matter of minutes. Concentric's team has developed a simulation model that delivers 95%+ accuracy across any industry and a huge range of questions. (Anything from \"How do you improve the subscriber experience to meet growth goals?\" to \"How do we allocate our marketing for a new alt-fuel vehicle?\" or \"What happens to appliance sales when we change our pricing?\" has been fair game.) Users can purchase any or all of Concentric's software products, which together are meant to provide an end-to-end solution for companies looking to obtain forecasting answers and integrate that information into their business strategies. \"We started with the model and we had to get the model right,\" Todisco says. \"Then we translated that into a software experience. We really wanted to be a step-by-step process to guide people down this path to getting their answers.\" In addition to its breadth, the software also distinguishes itself through its flexibility. Rather than having to run a new simulation for every question, users can integrate data into one model and then run multiple questions off of it. \"[This] increases your ability to answer questions a lot faster,\" Todisco says. \"It's incredibly flexible. It was designed to be exactly that way.\" The Future of Analytics Because of the software's flexibility, Concentric works with a huge range of businesses across a variety of industries, including entertainment, media, automotive, and consumer goods companies. \"We've definitely delivered some insights that have shifted business strategies for our customers,\" Todisco says, pointing to a recent report on the future of streaming services and the example of The E.W. Scripps Company, a media company that set out to tackle an ad sales problem. \"When you look at media companies, all of them are using basic data [such as show ratings and viewership] to sell their ad sales,\" Todisco says. \"[E.W. Scripps] wanted to give their buyers different data and forecast ROI for their advertisers. Now they're doing it. They're able to run hundreds of analyses in minutes and run reports on a daily basis.\" To hear Todisco tell it, examples such as E.W. Scripps suggest that without simulation, most companies are only halfway through the analytics journey. They've figured out how to obtain and analyze historical and present analytics, and they're incorporating those insights into their business strategies . But they haven't figured out how to integrate future forecasting into those processes. \"Now everybody's asking, 'What's next?',\" Todisco says. And Concentric's ongoing growth suggests that simulation is one way to find out. \"[Simulation can] reduce risk, improve efficiency, and drive growth... What we really believe is that simulation is the future of business analytics.\" Published on: Apr 2, 2019 More from Inc.

The group specifically pointed to paid subscriptions, which claimed 32.9 percent of industry revenue.\nThe recording industry has been growing for four straight years, but in effect is actually recovering from a \"decade-plus of decline,\" the IFPI noted. Labels and publishers were slow to adapt to the arrival of digital music, which resulted in piracy becoming commonplace even after the arrival of legal storefronts like iTunes and radio services like Pandora.\nOn-demand streaming may have finally cracked the value proposition needed to reach the masses. While buying a single album on iTunes typically costs at least $9.99, that same money grants access to tens of thousands of albums on Apple Music, if only for a month at a time. The convenience has apparently proven worth it for many people, even if some artists and labels are still holdouts, preferring to steer customers to shops like Bandcamp .\nThat option can make strong economic sense. Many artists have complained about earning poor revenues from on-demand services, and in fact pop superstar Taylor Swift initially refused to allow her music on Apple Music until Apple promised to pay musicians for streams during listeners' three-month trials. It's common for artists to depend on concerts and merchandise to actually sustain themselves.\nApple has since tried to position itself as more artist-friendly. Recently, for example, it declined to appeal royalty increases for songwriters.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "spotify", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "roger fingas", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pandora", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple music", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "international federation of the phonographic industry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ifpi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T19:10:22.042+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "55ca885a3bb3a2d6296fb020dc273f38d843d26a", "url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797564/000167479619000049/0001674796-19-000049-index.htm", "site_full": "www.sec.gov", "site": "sec.gov", "site_section": "https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcurrent&type=10-k&company=&dateb=&owner=include&start=0&count=40&output=atom", "site_categories": ["sports", "baseball", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "Latest Filings - Tue, 02 Apr 2019 12:28:03 EDT", "title": "10-K - HST Global, Inc.

(AAL) | By: Clark Schultz , SA News Editor A lift in guidance by Delta Air Lines ( DAL +4% ) is giving airline sector investors a reason to be confident, with some peers following Delta higher in early trading. Delta says it expects Q1 revenue growth of about 7% vs. +5% to +6% prior view and EPS of $0.85 to $0.95 vs. $0.70 to $0.90 prior view and $0.80 consensus. Delta's strong read could alleviate some of the anxiety over a Q1 that is being considered a disruptive period for the U.S. airline with the government shutdown impacting some bookings, the Boeing 737 Max crash and more system outages than normal. Delta is due to report full Q1 results next week.

Since then, the company has dutifully allocated a meaningful portion of its free cash flow to its dividend program and has raised its dividend payouts per share each year.\nWhile Apple is committed to its dividend program, the reality is that Apple isn't the highest-yielding stock out there. As of this writing, the company's dividend yield stands at 1.54%. That's a nontrivial amount, certainly, and the company is sure to raise it when it updates investors on its capital return program next month, but it's far from the most impressive yield that you can find in the world of tech stocks these days.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nTo that end, here are three tech stocks that offer more generous dividend yields than Apple does: Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) , and Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) .\n1. Broadcom Broadcom is a company that generates a gigantic -- and growing -- amount of free cash flow. The company has historically been focused on semiconductors (also more colloquially referred to as chips), but recently, it has been building up a large and highly profitable infrastructure software business, too, using its acquisitions of Brocade and CA Technologies as the foundation of that business.\nAVGO Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts .\nWhat income-oriented investors need to know, though, is that Broadcom allocates about half of its previous year's free cash flow to its dividend. Broadcom just raised its dividend to $10.60 per share -- a dividend yield of about 3.54% as of writing -- after turning in about $8.2 billion in free cash flow during its fiscal year 2018. The company is forecasting free cash flow of about $10 billion for the current fiscal year, suggesting that as long as the company's forecast is roughly accurate, shareholders should be in for yet another solid dividend bump later in this calendar year.\n2. Texas Instruments Another chip company that's very committed to its capital return program is Texas Instruments. The company's policy is to return all of its free cash flow to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. This strategy is something of a virtuous cycle -- as the company repurchases shares, reducing its overall share count, its free cash flow per share for a given level of free cash flow rises. On top of that, Texas Instruments is a good business that has seen its free cash flow trend generally up over the years, which has helped to fuel regular dividend boosts.\nTXN Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts .\nToday, Texas Instruments' shares offer a dividend yield of 2.9%, which is not only respectable on its own, but it's significantly greater than what Apple stock offers.\n3. Cisco Another tech company whose shares offer a larger dividend yield than Apple's do is networking technology giant Cisco Systems. Cisco is another company that generates a large amount of free cash flow and isn't shy about distributing the wealth to its shareholders. Its dividend yield as of writing stands at 2.59%.\nCSCO Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts .\nOver the last decade or so, Cisco's free cash flow has trended up and, along with it, so has the dividend.\nCSCO Dividend data by YCharts .\nCisco isn't the fastest-growing company on the planet, but it is a growing business, with analysts expecting the company to grow its revenue by 4.8% in 2019 followed by another 3.4% rise in 2020. Analysts also predict that Cisco's earnings per share (EPS) is on track to rise nearly 18.1% in 2019, followed by another 9.7% boost in 2020. Given that Cisco's business seems to be moving in the right direction, I think shareholders should be able to safely count on dividend increases in the years ahead.\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom Ltd\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Some Sh2.5 million was paid for the supply of material to rear earthworms and black flies for the financial year that ended on June 30, 2018. Another Sh1.8 million was spent on 600 plastic drums meant for rearing earthworms and black flies in 45 wards.However, no documentary evidence was provided for audit review to show that the materials were delivered as at the end of audit in November last year. As such, the propriety and accountability of the Sh2.5 million expenditure could not be confirmed. Auditor General Edward Ouko also cited inflation of the price of plastic drums from the market price of Sh1,000 to Sh3,000. The county executive may also have breached the law by spending Sh39,783,097 on office furniture and general equipment, which included Sh545,258 paid to a supplier for purchase of five laptops. According to the auditor, the tender opening committee also played the role of a tender evaluation committee, contrary to Section 78 (1) (b) of Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act.The Act requires that at least one member of the tender evaluation committee be directly involved in evaluation of tenders.

Reports 2018 Year-End Financial Results and Progress Updates Apr 2, 2019 Save\nSALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr 2, 2019-- Co-Diagnostics, Inc. (Nasdaq: CODX ), a molecular diagnostics company with a unique, patented platform for the development of molecular diagnostic tests, today announced the filing of their financial results for FY 2018, ending December 31, 2018, as well as updates on the Company\u2019s growth and progress for 2018 in the following areas:\nRevenues: Development of distributor network in 2018 led to commencement of commercial sales in Q1 2019 to Indian distributors. The sales consisted of primer sets for the non-clinical identification of tuberculosis, malaria, and human papillomavirus (HPV), engineered using the Co-Diagnostics\u2019 proprietary design process and patented CoPrimer\u2122 technology, as well as other test reagents and components used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Company expanded target markets to include Central and South America, announced exclusive distributor agreement in the Dominican Republic, and conducted training and sales seminars with nearly 20 labs and hospitals, setting up near-term sales potential.\nStrategic Relationships: Construction of the facility for CoSara Diagnostics Pvt Ltd., the Company\u2019s joint venture with Synbiotics Limited for manufacturing and sales in India, progressed towards completion in 2018; Company representatives are scheduled to attend the inaugural opening in April 2019. Co-Diagnostics signed license agreement with LGC, Biosearch for use of CoPrimer technology in the agriculture, livestock, and aquabio markets, seen as a major industry validation of the technology in multiplexing and SNP detection applications. Company\u2019s vector (mosquito) control program initiated in the United States; as testing mosquitos and other animal vectors does not involve human samples, domestic sales are not dependent on IVD approval (510(k) or Premarket Authorization) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nRegulatory: The Company received two major regulatory approvals in the form of CV-IVD clearance for their Logix Smart\u2122 MTB (tuberculosis) test and Logix Smart Zika test. A third CE-IVD clearance for the Logix Smart ZDC (Zika-dengue-chikunguna) multiplex test, the Company\u2019s first multi-pathogen assay, was also more recently received. CE-IVD clearance facilitates sale of products in Europe, and all other countries and jurisdictions that accept CE markings as valid regulatory approval for in vitro diagnostics.\nIntellectual Property: Co-Diagnostics\u2019 suite of intellectual property expanded upon receiving US patent protection for its flagship CoPrimer technology, opening the door for future license agreements of the technology and offering primer design services for PCR tests built on the platform. The Company further expanded its international licensing and revenue opportunities following receipt of UK patent for RapidProbe\u2122 design technology.\nTechnology: Company announced major milestones in scientific advancement of its CoPrimer technology, demonstrating its potential in multiplex SNP genotyping applications. The advancement was a result of an ongoing research and development study with LGC, Biosearch, which helped to set the stage for a subsequent license agreement.\nFinancial: All debt incurred in 2018 was eliminated in the sale of $3 million of preferred shares in January 2019, which consisted of negotiating the conversion of a $2M note to preferred stock, and an additional sale of $1M of preferred shares for cash, leaving the Company debt-free. Company announced the filing of an S-3 shelf registration to sell an aggregate amount of $25 million shares of its common stock, of which the Company sold 3,925,716 shares for gross proceeds of approximately $5.5 million in Q1 2019.\nDwight Egan, CEO of Co-Diagnostics, commented, \u201cThe milestones achieved during 2018 underscore the validation and uniqueness of our platform and our ability to obtain regulatory clearance for our tests. As a result of the above and our recent financings, we now have the resources and approvals required to begin commercializing our technology in several verticals and markets. We look forward to continuing our positive momentum in 2019 and beyond.\u201d\nAbout Co-Diagnostics, Inc.:\nCo-Diagnostics, Inc., a Utah corporation, is a molecular diagnostics company that develops, manufactures and markets a new, state-of-the-art diagnostics technology. The Company\u2019s technology is utilized for tests that are designed using the detection and/or analysis of nucleic acid molecules (DNA or RNA).

Which is the best for iPhone or Android owners? Which has the most support for all sorts of smart speakers? And which has the most perks for subscribers?\nOf course, Apple Music and Spotify aren't the only ones to choose from. In the US there are at least six major platforms to choose from , including YouTube Music, Google Play Music, Amazon Music and Tidal. Some have bigger catalogs than the others, or offer bundle deals to get music streaming as part of another package.\nBut here's how the big two compare for streaming music.\nSpotify vs. Apple Music\nSpotify Apple Music Price $10 a month or $5 a month for students $10 a month or $5 a month for students Family plan Yes, up to 6 people Yes, up to 6 people Free tier Yes, ad-supported No, only Beats1 radio Free trial 30 days 3 months Stream quality Up to 320kbps Ogg Vorbis, or AAC (see section below) 256kbps AAC Music library Over 40 million songs 50 million songs\n Apple Music vs. Spotify: Music streaming battle 7:57 Price and subscription options Both Spotify and Apple Music offer a free trial period for their premium services, which normally cost $10, \u00a310 or AU$12 a month. It costs $5 for students or $15 for family plans. With the premium version, you can stream any song from the catalog on demand, plus listen to songs offline.\nA Spotify Premium subscription will also give you access to Hulu's (ad-supported) video-streaming plan through June 10 at no extra cost. Spotify is also the only one of the two music services with a free, ad-supported tier , so even if you don't want to pay for the premium version you can still listen. The caveat (aside from the interruptions) is that many albums and playlists require you to listen in shuffle mode rather than sequential play and there's a limit of six skips per hour.\nApple Music only lets free users stream Beats1 Radio, or you can listen to songs from your iTunes library.\nWinner: Spotify\nThe free version of Spotify lets you listen to songs on demand, but many playlists and albums can only be listened to on shuffle.\nCelso Bulgatti/CNET Streaming quality In terms of stream quality, Spotify uses the Ogg Vorbis format. On mobile you can choose what bitrate to stream, in increments up to 320kbps, which is handy especially if you're worried about using up too much mobile data. Desktop playback is at 160kbps or 320kbps for premium users.\nIf you listen on Spotify's web player or via Chromecast , it streams in AAC at 128kbps for free users or 256kbps for premium.\nApple Music streams 256kbps AAC files.\nTo find out more about bitrate and audio quality, read this in-depth comparison of sound quality between Apple Music and Spotify .\nYou can also adjust the equalizer in both to suit your preferences (although you'll find Apple Music's EQ setting outside of the app, within the Settings > Music section on the iPhone ).\nUnless you're a serious audiophile, you probably won't notice much difference between the highest-quality Spotify and Apple Music streams of the same song. If the highest audio fidelity is really important to you, consider another service that supports lossless streaming like Tidal.\nWinner: draw\nBest sites to buy MP3 music 10 Photos Library and music selection Apple Music has a larger library for tunes, topping 50 million vs. Spotify's roughly 40 million. Both offer early access to certain albums from time to time and Apple Music sometimes offers exclusives for certain music videos.\nOn top of music, Spotify has a dedicated podcast section. Both also let you watch music videos and if you like something you hear in Apple Music, you can always buy the song or video direct through the iTunes Store.\nIf you turn on iCloud Music Library within Apple Music, you can access your personal library of tunes across all your devices (from the PC to the phone). This feature \"matches\" songs in your library with those in the iTunes catalog, or uploads them if the song isn't available, so you can listen to your music wherever you're signed in with your Apple ID. You can store up to 100,000 songs.\nNote that iTunes Match is also available even without an Apple Music subscription for $25 a year.\nSpotify also lets you play music from your device in the Spotify app, but it only works for local files (so they aren't stored in the cloud).\nWinner: Apple Music\nCelso Bulgatti/CNET Interface and navigation Apple Music features a clean white look on mobile, while Spotify paints it black across its apps. Both are pretty easy to navigate on mobile, with the main tabs (radio, search, your library and so on) found at the bottom of the interface.\nDepending on the song, Spotify has animations and short videos that play full screen while you're listening. Both let you look at lyrics on screen if they're available for particular songs. But only Apple Music lets you search by typing a stream of lyrics to find songs you don't know the name of.\nGoogle Maps lets you listen to and control Spotify or Apple Music playback within the navigation interface in iOS and Android. Waze also offers a similar feature for Spotify users.\nOn top of CarPlay support, Apple Music for Android now works with Android Auto, so you can control playback through the infotainment system.\nWinner: draw\nWhere can you listen? Both Apple Music and Spotify are available on iOS and Android. Both have a standalone desktop apps for Windows and Mac, so you aren't limited to listening on mobile. In the case of Apple Music, that's iTunes.\nSpotify Connect lets you Cast to compatible devices and listen on AirPlay speakers (on iOS only).\nCelso Bulgatti/CNET You can also listen to music in your browser: Spotify is at open.spotify.com . But Apple Music it isn't technically a full web player, it's more of a web widget at tools.applemusic.com .\nAnd you can also stream any audio to a Bluetooth wireless speaker, to an AirPlay speaker from an iOS device, or to a Chromecast speaker from an Android device (you can also cast from iOS if you have Spotify).\nWhen it comes to smart speakers, Apple Music with Siri voice control on Apple's HomePod and is now compatible with Amazon's full line of Echo smart speakers via the Alexa App (US only). It's also available on other Apple and Amazon devices like the Apple Watch , Apple TV and FireTV.\nIn addition to Amazon Alexa speakers, Spotify is also available on and Google smart speakers. And, if a device is certified as Spotify Connect compatible , it means you can use the Spotify app as a remote to control playback. Spotify is also available across a wide range of other devices like Xbox and PlayStation.\nWinner: Spotify\nMusic discovery tools Beats1 Radio.\nScreenshot by Lexy Savvides/CNET One of the top reasons to use a streaming service is to discover new music. Both Spotify and Apple Music expose you to new tunes based on what you already like.\nSpotify has tailored playlists like Discover Weekly and Release Radar that are automatically populated each week with new songs. Apple Music has similar playlists, including New Music Mix.\nWhen you first sign up for each service, both ask you for your favorite genres and artists to get a baseline reading. Once you start listening more, each gets a clearer picture of your likes and dislikes to help tailor recommendations even further.\nSpotify and Apple Music also have radio stations based around your favorite artists, tracks or genres. Apple Music also has a separate station called Beats1 Radio which is curated and hosted by actual DJs, so you can listen to it in real time like you would a traditional radio station.\nIn our experience, Spotify's algorithmic recommendations for new music based on our listening habits is the most on-point. But Apple Music's human-curated radio station often uncovers new or unreleased tracks that also appeal.\nWinner: Spotify\nSocial sharing Spotify codes can be scanned with the camera to share playlists.\nScreenshot by Lexy Savvides/CNET Both services let you follow your favorite artists to keep up to date with their posts and latest releases.\nYou can also follow friends. On Spotify, you can see what song your pals are listening to in real-time (if they choose to share this detail) on the desktop app.\nSpotify Codes are a way to share tracks, albums and playlists among friends. It's kind of like a custom QR code that you can scan with the camera in Spotify if you're listening in the same location, or share through messages if you're apart.\nMany popular musicians seem to be more active in posting updates on Apple Music and it's easier to find that content than it is on Spotify.\nNaturally, you can also follow your friends and see what they're up to across both platforms. While it's much easier to find profiles on Apple Music than it is on Spotify, you do have to already have your friends in your contacts list (or on Facebook) to follow them.\nWinner: Apple Music\nWhich one is right for you? If you want a free service, Spotify is the clear winner. But if you are looking to pay for a service, your decision may be a little more complicated.\nApple Music plays well with other Apple devices. If you want voice control on the HomePod, for example, Apple Music is your only option. Spotify, on the other hand, has greater cross-compatibility across lots of different devices, from game consoles to smart speakers.\nIt takes time to train each of these services to really get to know your taste. For our money, Spotify does a better job in uncovering and tailoring playlists and recommendations to us through its custom playlists and discovery features.

The company builds some of the world's best mobile applications processors to power its iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch product lines and has expanded its capabilities to include other types of chips in some of those devices, like power management chips, as well as chips to power things such as its wildly successful AirPods wireless earbuds. Powering Apple's impressive chip efforts is an army of sharp chip engineers led by strong leaders. According to a new report from CNET , one of those leaders, Gerard Williams III, has left the company. CNET says that he \"hasn't yet joined another company.\" Two girls playing with iPhones in an Apple store. More Let's take a closer look at why this matters. His work speaks for itself One area where Apple differentiates itself from the pack is in the quality of its mobile CPU cores, which serve as the heart of the company's mobile applications processors. According to recent testing from AnandTech , the CPU core in the company's A11 Bionic chip, which is nearly a year and a half old, significantly outperforms the CPU cores found in top Android-based devices in the SPECint2006 and SPECfp2006 suites of CPU performance tests. The CPU cores in the more current A12 Bionic are even faster and only widen the gap between Apple's products and the competition's. Apple should introduce yet another new mobile CPU in about six months, and it should offer even better performance. According to Williams' LinkedIn profile, he led the development of Apple's CPU cores known as Cyclone, Typhoon, Twister, Hurricane, Monsoon, and Vortex CPUs. Put simply, he led all but one of Apple's high-performance custom CPU cores. (Apple first launched a custom CPU core in its A6 chip, known as Swift.) Now, of course, it takes more than just one individual to design a CPU core, but teams of engineers benefit from great leaders, and the fact that Williams led the development of six best-in-class mobile CPU cores tells me that he is, in fact, a great leader. A valuable asset to his next employer I agree with CNET's Shara Tibken, who wrote that \"Williams' departure is a loss for Apple.\" That said, this development is unlikely to cripple Apple's CPU efforts. Having managed to nab talent from all across the industry, Apple has a deep bench of high-profile CPU architects under its roof these days. I expect that someone from within the company's ranks will fill the void Williams has left and will lead the company's efforts to keep building best-in-class CPU cores. What will be really interesting to see is where Williams ends up next, if he's not retiring from the industry. Many companies could benefit from Williams' expertise, ranging from companies that build their own mobile CPUs to those that build high-performance CPU cores for applications such as data center servers, network infrastructure, and personal computers. Williams' expertise isn't limited to CPU cores, either. According to his LinkedIn profile, he was the chief architect \"for all Apple CPU and [system-on-a-chip] development.\" That means he's not just good at leading the teams responsible for CPU cores -- critical components of any mobile chip -- but he's also proved himself able to lead the development of entire mobile system-on-a-chip designs, which consist of many different pieces, including the CPU cores, integrated together. Story continues I'll be keeping an eye on Williams' LinkedIn profile in anticipation of seeing where he winds up.

( AAPL - Free Report ) has slashed prices of most of its flagship devices, including iPhones, iPads, Macs and AirPods by about 6% on its official Chinese online store.\nThe price cut is in response to a fall in value-added tax (VAT) in China that took effect on Apr 1. VAT for manufacturers like Apple was brought down from 16% to 13%, per Caixin.\nApple also announced refund eligibility for the price difference for anyone who has purchased one of the products over the two weeks preceding the sale.\nFor instance, the price for entry-level iPhone XR, which originally cost 6499RMB, was slashed 4.6% to 6199RMB. Further, there was a 500RMB price cut each for iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max.\nWill Lower VAT Boost Apple\u2019s Sales in China?\nGreater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, contributed to 15.6% of the Apple\u2019s sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Revenues, however, fell 26.7% from the year-ago quarter to $13.17 billion. The decline was across the board, including iPhone, Mac and iPad.\nPer a Reuters article on Feb 11, 2019, which cited an IDC report, Apple\u2019s iPhone sales in China fell 20% year over year in the fourth quarter of calendar 2018.\nChina currently has 2.5 million registered iOS developers. The assembling work of iPhones is done in China at very low labor cost, which is hugely beneficial for Apple. However, the slowdown in the nation\u2019s economy is expected to further hurt sales of iPhone, Mac and iPad.\nMoreover, the steep pricing of new iPhones is resulting in Apple losing considerable share to Xiaomi, which offers devices of similar features at a significantly lower price. Also, Huawei is gaining traction in the Chinese market, following Samsung as the world\u2019s largest smartphone maker.\nThe price slash due to lower VAT is expected to benefit Apple as this will make its products more affordable in China.\nApple Inc.

Microsoft was formerly the frontrunner, having surpassed Apple in November .\nMicrosoft closed Tuesday at $914.45 billion in market capitalization.\nThe reason for Apple's resurgence in the short-term isn't clear, given analyst reaction to the \"its show time\" Apple News event, but analysts and investors appear to be regaining confidence in the wake of a disastrous December quarter which saw iPhone sales tumble 15 percent year-over-year . The company saw its worst performance in China, battered by a combination of lower-cost local phone brands, a weak economy, and its decision to once again hike entry-level iPhone prices, exacerbated by exchange rates.\nIt has since adopted more aggressive sales tactics to compensate, cutting prices in some countries and extending extra trade-in credit.\nSome analysts are pinning their hopes on Apple's growing services business, which includes divisions like Apple Music, the App Store, and its upcoming Apple TV+ video service , coupled with the now-available Apple News+ .\nWhile the services themselves may add a modest boost to profits, the real benefit is expected to be keeping people locked into the Apple ecosystem.

Some developers say that those techniques violate Apple's own App Store policies. Spotify and presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren have said that Apple is using its own platforms to disadvantage its competitors who distribute their software through the App Store. Published 4:19 PM ET Tue, 2 April 2019 CNBC.com Josh Edelson | AFP | Getty Images Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) at the San Jose Convention Center in San Jose, California on Monday, June 4, 2018.\nWhen Apple released its new subscription news service last week, third-party app developers were up in arms, noticing right away that Apple was providing favorable treatment to its homegrown product.\nThe service, Apple News+, is being promoted to users as a free trial with its monthly $9.99 subscription price noted on the smallest font on the screen, a format that outside developers said would draw scrutiny during Apple's App Store review process, and could potentially lead to a rejection from Apple's reviewers.\nApple also did not include a block of required fine print it requires for third-party developers to use Apple's subscription sign-ups, including mandatory links to a privacy policy and support page, as well as information about how to cancel a subscription and when it will be billed.\nApple's newfound willingness to bend its own App Store guidelines to promote paid subscription services like Apple Music and Apple News+ comes as the company is increasingly turning to revenue from online services as growth for its primary iPhone business slows.\nThe shift is also happening as Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren and rivals like Spotify have started saying that Apple is using its own platforms to disadvantage its competitors who distribute their software through the App Store.\nApple declined to comment.\nIn a long thread last week in response to a tweet that has since been deleted, a group of developers complained that Apple was able to design its subscription sign-up screen to maximize engagement in ways that other developers cannot, such as where the price of the monthly subscription is located and the size and contents of any fine print, which can have a huge effect on getting users to pay for digital subscriptions. Tweet\nOther developers noted that Apple News+ stops working shortly after the subscription is canceled, even if the user is still in the free-trial period. Developers are required under Apple's rules to continue providing their service through the end of the billing period, or if there's time left on a free-trial. Tweet\nSome recalled that for the past few months, Apple has started to send promotional push notifications to encourage iPhone owners to sign up for some of its services, like Apple Music's family plan. Apple's guidelines strongly discourage push notifications for \"advertising, promotions, or direct marketing purposes.\" Tweet\nOther developers said that Apple's choices are within Apple's purview. After all, it is the owner of the platform, so it makes the rules. Plus, Apple's apps are pre-installed on the iPhone, and they are only distributed through the App Store in case users delete them.\n\"As the platform owner, Apple has a couple of advantages,\" one developer, who asked to remain anonymous because they feared retribution from Apple, told CNBC. \"But it is frustrating from the point of view that [Apple] knows it works better to get more paying customers, and they won't let us do it.\" A curated platform\nApple says that humans review every submission to the App Store before users can download apps.\n\"What users want from us and what we've always provided them is a curated platform,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said last year in an interview with Vice. \"We think that what the user wants is someone that does review these apps.\"\nBut some developers complain that Apple's approach has led to inconsistent policing, given that the App Store has over 2 million different apps on it from a variety of companies, ranging from small start-ups to tech giants like Google and Facebook .\nApple has to also fight scam apps, like a recent and ongoing rash of \" sneaky subscription \" apps that try to fool users into accidentally signing up for expensive monthly subscriptions, which is the reason for many of Apple's App Store billing guidelines.\nThe App Store review policy has led to some developers treating recommended best practices as actual guidelines. One complaint with the Apple News+ signup screen is that Apple did not put the $9.99 price on the signup button, as many developers believe is required because Apple has slowed down the approval of some apps because subscription pricing isn't clear.\nBut Apple doesn't actually require apps to put the subscription price on its button, according to a person familiar with the App Store guidelines. The price just needs to be clearly visible and comply with California laws about automatic renewals. ( Apple publishes a 4,000-word guide to how to design for auto-renewing subscriptions that says that \"the amount that will be billed must be the most prominent pricing element in the layout.\")\nLots of companies send push notifications advertising products and services, despite the fact that the practice is discouraged in Apple's own guidelines. But promotional push notifications are permitted, the person familiar with the guidelines said, and if developers are thoughtful about what they push, they can send marketing push notifications. A new services company\nApple is pitching itself to investors and customers as not only a hardware maker and platform owner, but also a company that sells a variety of services to its users.\nLast week, Apple held a launch event at its headquarters in California to underscore the shift and announce new subscription services, including Apple News+ and a new a streaming video package called Apple TV+.\nApple CEO Tim Cook has implied he wants the company's services business to generate $50 billion in revenue by 2020. Apple's services include fees collected from the App Store, subscriptions like iCloud and Apple Music, gadget warranties from AppleCare and licensing fees from Google to be the Safari web browser's default search engine.\nBut at the same time, several groups have started to accuse Apple of abusing its power over the App Store to favor its own services over third-party apps.\n\"Apple, you've got to break it apart from their App Store. It's got to be one or the other,\" Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in an interview with The Verge . \"Either they run the platform or they play in the store. They don't get to do both at the same time.\"\nSpotify recently submitted an antitrust complaint against Apple to the European Commission.\n\"In recent years, Apple has introduced rules to the App Store that purposely limit choice and stifle innovation at the expense of the user experience \u2014 essentially acting as both a player and referee to deliberately disadvantage other app developers,\" Spotify CEO Daniel Ek wrote in a letter. Apple posted a response to Spotify on its website that said that Spotify was trying to use Apple's platform without paying the cost.\nHowever, whether Apple's control over the App Store is anticompetitive is a tricky question, antitrust experts said. One reason is that consumers who want an alternative can easily buy an Android phone, meaning that Apple may not be technically dominant.\n\"Apple doesn't have the same broad monopoly power that Google and Facebook have,\" Open Markets legal director Sandeep Vaheesan said.\n\"Antitrust challenges arise when Apple tries to restrict other entities on its platform,\" he continued. \"It's a real concern because Apple has told both iOS users and developers if you want to sell or purchase you have to go through the App Store, and there's no other way for the two sides to connect with each other.\"\nAnother fact that could stymie Spotify and Warren's arguments is that Apple has legitimate product reasons to control access to the App Store, including security and its brand value.\n\"Apple generally believes they have to control the entire user experience from beginning to end, and all of these rules on the App Store can be said to be necessary for the quality of the experience,\" said Chris Sagers, a professor of law at Cleveland State University.\n\"Antitrust cases boil down to the details. Figuring out what exactly these rules that Apple imposes and how they actually keep other people from competing with Apple \u2014 that's complicated,\" he continued. show chapters", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "josh edelson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tim cook", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "app store", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san jose convention center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san jose", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T23:23:46.065+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a5a6d5f17641f8334cd7e7b5435e5a8f64eb6234", "url": "https://www.inc.com/amy-nelson/equal-pay-day-women-gender-wage-salary-equality.html", "site_full": "www.inc.com", "site": "inc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "business_software", "business", "marketing"], "section_title": "", "title": "Attention, Men: You Need to Start Making Noise About the Gender Pay Gap | Inc.com", "title_full": "Attention, Men: You Need to Start Making Noise About the Gender Pay Gap | Inc.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/pay-gap-648538805_387945.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 1265, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 324, "comments": 110, "shares": 110}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a5a6d5f17641f8334cd7e7b5435e5a8f64eb6234", "url": "https://www.inc.com/amy-nelson/equal-pay-day-women-gender-wage-salary-equality.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Amy Nelsonfounder", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Attention, Men: You Need to Start Making Noise About the Gender Pay Gap | Inc.com", "text": "@amy_riveter\nWe all know the refrain: Women make less than men , with the same qualifications, for the same work. The data has told this clear story for decades. Studies say it will take over 100 years to close the gap in the United States, and over 200 years to eradicate it worldwide . We even mark a day on the calendar every year, April 2, that \"symbolizes how far into the year women must work to earn what men earned in the previous year.\" We repeat these statistics so often we seem to accept them as being part of an unalterable norm.\nBut there's something else amiss, and I think about it often as CEO and founder of The Riveter , a company focused on advancing women in their work. We frame the pay gap as a women's issue , as if women bear the sole responsibility to shore up that inequity with hard work, determination, and grit. It isn't a women's issue, and we should stop talking about it like it is. Unequal pay for equal work is an issue for everyone to tackle , including men.\nIt's simple: If half the population is paid less than the other (and it is!), it means half the population is being undervalued. The tangible economic result of this negatively impacts most households in the U.S. How could it not? It's math. If almost half of Americans age 18 and older live with a spouse of a different gender, it follows that almost 50 percent of Americans live in a household in which one spouse is underpaid in comparison to what a white man would be paid. The gender pay gap is a household issue. It impacts the amount of money most Americans have to pay for childcare, to put into savings, to set aside for retirement, or at bare minimum, pay for basic needs like housing and food. And it certainly means that everyone knows and loves someone whose work isn't being valued.\nI also firmly believe that the pay gap is one of the 10,000 paper cuts that drive almost half of women to leave the workforce after they become mothers . (I'm pretty adamant about this belief because it was certainly something that led me to leave a decade-long career as a corporate litigator and start my own company where I could set my own salary.) The gender pay gap is hurting every one of us.\nAnd there's more to it, of course. The gender pay gap is also an issue that impacts our nation's economy on a broader scale. Consider this: 2016 estimates showed that equal pay would add approximately $512 billion to the economy, or 2.8 percent of the GDP. This GDP point was among the pages of sobering numbers and facts in a 2017 report issued by the Institute for Women's Policy Research . That report included data showing that providing equal pay to women would cut the poverty rate for all working women in half and also halve the number of children with working mothers living in poverty. The number of American children affected if their moms got equal pay? 25.8 million. 25.8 million children would be able to have a better life and a brighter future because their mothers would be paid for the value they bring to the workforce. This is hard to stomach. And yet the gaps remain largely the same year after year, and we continue to mark equal pay days on our calendars, and the old framing prevails that this is a women's issue.\nSo what do we do when faced with an everyone issue? Simple: We need men to start making noise. We need men to step up and be part of the chorus to demand equal pay for all. We still live in a country where there are more Fortune 500 CEOs named John than there are women CEOs on the Fortune 500 at all. If we're going to prompt full systems redesign, every man in every C-suite needs to be not only an ally but an accomplice in this effort. Women can't drive this change on our own -- and we shouldn't have to try to do so.\nWe can also remember to talk about -- and take action toward -- equal pay every day, not just on April 2. We can discuss the gap on August 22, when Black and African-American women finally earn what white men earned in 2018 or September 23 for Native American women. We'll do it again November 20, when the 53 cents Latina women earn represents an Equal Pay Day. I'm the mother of three daughters (four come June), and I refuse to accept any of this for my daughters or myself. At The Riveter, we've kicked off a year-long #not100 campaign to continue the conversation around pay inequity every day via events with experts at our co-working spaces nationwide, a special edition of our newsletter, content that outlines actions we can take, and social media that I hope makes its way into your feeds.\nChange is possible. Just 100 years ago, the National Association Opposed to Women's Suffrage urged Americans to vote against a woman's right to vote because \"it means competition of women with men rather than cooperation .\" Fortunately, the men in government disagreed with this sentiment and voted to establish the legal right of women to vote in 1920. As we near the 100th anniversary of this historic American milestone, it's time that we all work together again to ensure that women, and all of us, stand -- and earn -- in true equality.

In the email, the user explains how he had \u201cnever noticed\u201d anything wrong with him until he decided to try the ECG feature on his Apple Watch \u201cjust for fun.\u201d\nIn trying the ECG app, the man noticed that the results were \u201cconstantly\u201d suggesting he suffered from atrial fibrillation. He then consulted a friend who happened to be a doctor, who told him that it was \u201cprobably just a measurement error.\u201d\nFrom there, the highly skeptical Apple Watch user went to his normal physician, who then performed a 12-channel ECG. \u201cThe watch is right,\u201d the doctor concluded. The Apple Watch user was then prescribed medication to treat his Afib.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true, the Watch contributed to prolonging my life,\u201d the patient said. \u201cNow I see the whole discussion with different eyes.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the first time an Apple Watch skeptic has discovered health problems through the wearable. In January, an Apple Watch user identified his Afib heart condition despite initially dismissing the symptoms as \u201choliday anxiety.\u201d Tim Cook also shared a story from an Apple Watch user in January .\nAfter being exclusive to the United States since launch in December, the Apple Watch ECG and irregular heartbeat notification features expanded to Hong Kong and a handful of new countries in Europe.

Source: Instagram By Gabrielle Bernardini\n32 minutes ago\nIt\u2019s over! Leah Messer and boyfriend Jason Jordan have ended their relationship. Us Weekly reported the breakup news after the two reconciled in November 2018.\nThough the Teen Mom 2 star waited to officially confirm her split weeks later, fans started questioning her relationship status.\nThe 26-year-old posted a cryptic message on her Instagram story on March 13, writing, \u201cWhen someone shows you who they are believe them. Facts.\u201d\nThe following day, Leah decided to vent via the \u2018Gram and posted the caption, \u201cEveryone comes into our lives for a reason, a season or a lifetime. I\u2019m thankful for everyone I\u2019ve journeyed with and continue to learn and grow.\u201d Preach, girl!\nHowever, as fans continued to question if her posts were about her \u201creported ex,\u201d Leah finally set the record on her relationship straight. She tweeted: \u201cJust to be very clear, Nothing that I post is in reference to my recent break up or Jason! I wish him the best!!!!\u201d Ouch. So, why did Leah and Jason break up?\nThis is certainly not the first time the two decided to end their relationship. Before the holidays, the MTV starlet said goodbye to her 40-year-old beau.\n\u201cIt just wasn\u2019t working,\u201d a source told Us at the time. \u201cThey\u2019re just not a good fit.\u201d\nThe reality star also told HollywoodLife.com that her ex-beau was not in the right mindset to be in a committed relationship, saying, \u201cHe wasn\u2019t in a great place in his life, and it is what it is. It\u2019s fine.\u201d\nLeah didn\u2019t stay single for long and the two decided to give love another shot. Why Did Leah and Jason get back together?\nWhile the pair reconciled in late November, they reportedly ended their relationship at the beginning of of last month. The former couple initially met through Jordan\u2019s cousin and were reportedly \u201cgetting serious\u201d last July. Source: Instagram\n\u201cThey share the same faith and have gone to church together,\u201d a source told Us Weekly at the time. And their 14-year age difference was seemingly not a negative factor in their relationship, the source cited, claiming: \u201cEven though he\u2019s older, they have a lot of common. They love hiking, cooking and are both very family oriented. He\u2019s very attentive.\u201d\nWhile the couple decided to part ways, we can\u2019t rule out a possible reunion. In Teen Mom world, you certainly never know what ex will pop back up on our TV screens.\nFor now, with her ex in her rearview mirror, Leah seems to be finding comfort with her daughters \u2014 Aliannah and Aleeah, 9, and Adalynn, 6. She recently posted a gorgeous Instagram pic of herself with the three girls, which she captioned, \u201cThey will forever be my reasoning for a successful and abundantly joyful simple LIFE! Everything I do, I do it for them.\u201d\nWatch new episodes of Teen Mom 2 on Mondays at 9 p.m ET on MTV.

Apple Card: A no-fee credit card designed to be integrated fully into an iPhone. The card offers cash back on certain purchases, and \"Apple Card's goal is to provide interest rates that are among the lowest in the industry, and if a customer misses a payment, they will not be charged a penalty rate,\" according to a press release. It's easy to see why Apple's adding these services, but it's harder to see how any of them will become major hits. Apple TV+ may have top-tier content creators, but so do a handful of other streaming services that are already established. Why pay Apple when you already have Netflix, HBO, and who knows what else?\nApple News+ offers value to people who read a lot of magazines, but is that really a large audience? This looks at best to be a niche product that serves an older audience -- if any market for it exists at all.\nApple Arcade is a similarly risky venture. Yes, games are a popular download in the iTunes store, but serious gamers aren't playing on phones or tablets. Yes, this service eliminates having to pay for some games and takes micro payments out of gameplay, but that may not be enough to win a large audience.\nAn Apple credit card has some appeal, but it's not that different from a variety of other options. It makes sense for die-hard fans of the brand who buy new hardware every year, but it's not a clearly better offer for the public at large.\nWhere will Apple be in a year? Call it a rough guess, but one year from now Apple will have a few well-reviewed shows on Apple TV+ but lack any significant membership base. That's not a comment on the potential quality of the service but a reflection of the market.\nIn the next few months, Apple will launch its service and Walt Disney will enter the streaming entertainment space as well. One has unknown shows from brand-name providers. The other has Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, and decades of children's programming, making it hard to see Apple gaining a foothold in this space.\nNews+ and Arcade simply aren't mass-market products, and you can argue the same about the company's self-branded credit card. These three may help the bottom line only because costs are low. Apple TV+, however, will be a drain on resources for years -- maybe decades -- as the company spends on creating programming that will make consumers join yet-another streaming service.\nA year from now, Apple will look a lot like it does right now, but perhaps with less optimism about its ability to create a significant new source of revenue. As part of a bigger transformation, these moves may prove important, but on their own, they are underwhelming.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jennifer aniston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim cook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven spielberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reese witherspoon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oprah winfrey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "netflix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T01:02:42.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "344e9966ba6967866fe38018590b92492b8e4d66", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/2019/04/02/apple-earnings-mark-your-calendar.aspx", "site_full": "www.fool.com", "site": "fool.com", "site_section": "https://www.fool.com/", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "Fool.com: Stock Investing Advice | Stock Research ", "title": "Apple Earnings: Mark Your Calendar", "title_full": "Apple Earnings: Mark Your Calendar -- The Motley Fool", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/517959/apple-earnings.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1336, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "344e9966ba6967866fe38018590b92492b8e4d66", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/2019/04/02/apple-earnings-mark-your-calendar.aspx", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Daniel Sparks", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Apple Earnings: Mark Your Calendar", "text": "Investors will get a timely update on Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) later this month. The company just scheduled a date for its fiscal second-quarter report: April 30. The update will not only reveal whether Apple's iPhone business continues to struggle to live up to last year's tough comparisons, but will also provide an important view into the tech giant's invigorated effort to bulk up its services business.\nHere's an overview of some of the key areas investors will want to watch when Apple reports its fiscal second-quarter earnings.\nApple CEO Tim Cook. Image source: Apple.\nTotal revenue The Street will undoubtedly be watching Apple's top-line growth closely. CEO Tim Cook shocked investors earlier this year when he said the company would miss its initial revenue guidance for its fiscal first quarter by a whopping $7 billion . The news sent shares tumbling. When Apple announces its fiscal second-quarter results, therefore, it will need to report revenue within its guidance range for the period in order to regain investor confidence in its guidance methodology.\nAnd considering that Apple's revenue fell 5% year over year in fiscal Q1, investors will likely be looking for signs that the company can make progress on mitigating its declining revenue\nUnfortunately, any sign of improving revenue likely won't come from Apple's fiscal second quarter, as management guided for revenue between $55 billion and $59 billion during the period. The midpoint of this guidance range represents a 7% year-over-year decline. But this doesn't mean investors shouldn't look for a sign of improving top-line trends; management's fiscal third-quarter revenue guidance will hopefully call for a narrower year-over-year decline.\niPhone revenue Apple's iPhone revenue will obviously be a hot topic for fiscal Q2. It fell 15% year over year in Q1 -- a stark contrast from the 29% iPhone revenue growth in the prior quarter.\nIf you combine management's guidance for total revenue to fall 7% year over year in fiscal Q2 with the fact that the iPhone accounts for over half of Apple's total revenue, it means that management almost certainly anticipated another meaningful decline in iPhone revenue during the quarter. Indeed, this segment likely saw another double-digit year-over-year decrease. The big question, therefore, is whether the decline was even worse in fiscal Q2 than it was in fiscal Q1.\nServices revenue Finally, investors will want to check on Apple's services business , which represents the company's second-largest segment. The iPhone's recent troubles have prompted management to double-down on efforts to diversify beyond smartphones. Indeed, just last week it announced four new services to bolster the segment.\nServices revenue has been rising sharply, up 27% year over year in calendar 2018. Without a reason to expect a slowdown, investors should look for similarly strong growth from the segment in fiscal Q2.\nApple will report its fiscal second-quarter results after market close on Tuesday, April 30.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tim cook", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T01:02:45.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "56a72c810c5c9476464638621da7d8e17dac9b84", "url": "http://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/04/02/walgreens-boots-alliance-inc-wba-q2-2019-earnings.aspx", "site_full": "www.fool.com", "site": "fool.com", "site_section": "http://www.fool.com/investing-news/", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "Motley Fool News &amp; Analysis -- The Motley Fool ", "title": "Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

After this call, the presentation and webcast will be archived on the website for 12 months.\nI will now hand you over to Stefano.\nStefano Pessina -- Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Gerald, and hello, everyone. I want to acknowledge upfront that this has been a very disappointing quarter for us. There is nothing entirely new in what we have seen impact our business during the quarter. Let's say, a number of the trends we had been expecting and preparing for, impacted us significantly more quickly than we had anticipated. We found ourselves facing a combination of increased reimbursement pressure in the quarter, lower generic deflation, lower brand inflation and slower than anticipated benefits from our counteract pressure in (ph) our retail offering, primarily in the US.\nOf course, the pharmacy trends are not only impacting our business, they are impacting the overall market and will likely continue to do so over the coming months. Let me be clear, however, I am convinced that our existing strategic priorities are the right ones, and will allow us to deliver sustainable growth into the future.\nLet me remind you of our four priorities: accelerating the digitalization of our Company; transforming and restructuring our retail offering; creating neighborhood health destination around more modern pharmacy; and rolling out our transformational cost management program. We are making strong progress against these transformation priorities across multiple fronts. However, we now need to respond appropriately to the tougher environment that we find ourselves in. We will build off our existing transformation priorities and we will reinforce and accelerate our actions.\nWe are acting quickly to address select areas of operational weakness with a number of senior appointments, choosing new talent with new ideas and new approaches to drive more rapid change in a number of areas of our business. We are also strengthening and refocusing our operational management to ensure increased focus on driving operational excellence.\nIn recent months, we have brought in a new Chief Digital Officer, a new Global Chief Marketing Officer, a new Global Chief Supply Chain Officer. We have restructured entirely the organization of our brands business and since the quarter end, we have bought in a new Global Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. We have reviewed our priorities and business initiatives under way and have revoked our management plans in light of the more adverse environment.\nFirst and foremost, we are acknowledging the short-term headwinds we are facing and the limited time we have available to compensate for the impact in the remainder of the year. As a result, we are reducing our guidance for fiscal 2019. James will talk to you about that in a moment. We believe that the actions that we are taking will result in improved performance in 2020. Looking beyond that, we are convinced that our business model can deliver sustainable adjusted earning per share growth of mid to high-single digits.\nI will now ask James to take you through the results and our updated guidance for the year. James?\nJames Kehoe -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Stefano, and good morning, everyone. On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings per share declined 4.3% in the quarter, bringing our first half EPS growth to 3.6%. The results were much weaker than we had expected due to three key factors. As with our competitors, we are seeing continued reimbursement pressure and the opportunities to mitigate have reduced due to lower levels of generic deflation and lower brand inflation.\nThe second key factor is volume. Our same-store growth in the US is trending below plan in both pharmacy and front of store. And lastly, consumer conditions in the UK remain challenging. We are also lapping a particularly strong second quarter last year, when constant currency adjusted EPS increased 25.7%. We are clearly not pleased with this quarter's performance, and we are taking immediate actions to improve operational performance and to reinforce and accelerate our existing transformation plans.\nLet's now look in more detail at the numbers. In the second quarter, sales increased 4.6%, including a currency headwind of 2.1%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 6.7%, reflecting the acquisition of the Rite Aid stores. Organic sales growth was 2.5%. Adjusted operating income declined 10.4%, or 9.3% on a constant currency basis. The decline was mainly due to a weak quarter in Retail Pharmacy USA, which declined 11.9% year-on-year due to lower pharmacy margins and the decline in front-end comparable sales.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share declined 5.4% to $1.64, a decrease of 4.3% on a constant currency basis. This includes a 4.5 percentage point contribution from our share repurchase program. GAAP operating income declined 23% in the quarter, including restructuring charges of $150 million as we ramp up the transformational cost management program and the prior year adjustment of $113 million relating to AmerisourceBergen tax law changes. GAAP EPS declined 8.3% to $1.24 per share.\nBefore I move onto our divisional performance, let me briefly cover first half financial highlights. Sales increased 7.2%, including a currency headwind of 1.8%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 9%, reflecting the acquisition of the Rite Aid stores. Organic sales growth was 3.3%. Adjusted operating income declined 7.5%, or 6.6% on a constant currency basis, reflecting the negative impact of reimbursement pressure on US Pharmacy gross margins, comp sales declines in US Retail and weak market conditions in the UK.\nAdjusted EPS increased 3.6% on a constant currency basis. GAAP earnings per share were up 12%, as the absence of prior year items related to US tax law changes and impairment were partly offset by $179 million of pre-tax restructuring costs related to the transformational cost management program.\nNow, let's look at the performance of our divisions, starting with Retail Pharmacy USA. Sales advanced 7.3% in the quarter, reflecting the acquired Rite Aid stores and organic sales growth of 1.6%. Adjusted gross profit declined 3.5% in the quarter, reflecting declines in both Pharmacy and Retail. Gross margin declined 260 basis points, mostly due to Pharmacy.\nAdjusted SG&A spend declined 0.6% versus prior year, and excluding Rite Aid, adjusted SG&A spend was 6.8% lower than the prior period. Continued cost saving initiatives and the impact of a lower bonus accrual, more than offset inflation and store labor investments. Adjusted SG&A was 17.7% of sales, an improvement of 140 basis points compared to the year ago quarter.\nAdjusted operating income declined 11.9% in the quarter. Continued SG&A savings, procurement savings and pharmacy volume growth were not sufficient to offset the unusually high year-on-year impact from reimbursement and under-performance in the front of store. This result included store and labor investments of $40 million in the quarter, equivalent to approximately 240 basis points of adjusted operating income.\nNow, let's look in more detail at Pharmacy. Total Pharmacy sales increased 9.8%, reflecting the acquisition of the Rite Aid stores, and organic growth of 4%. Second quarter market share was 22.3%, up approximately 90 basis points compared to last year, reflecting the acquired Rite Aid stores. Comp Pharmacy sales increased 1.9%, and our central specialty business grew 28.7% year-on-year. The number of retail prescriptions filled on a 30-day adjusted basis, including immunizations, increased 6.4%. Comp prescriptions grew 1.8%, slightly behind the first-quarter growth of 2%.\nPharmacy gross profit decline versus prior year, as volume growth was more than offset by lower gross margin. The pharmacy market is very challenging right now, and we are seeing similar trends through our competitors. Reimbursement pressure has continued and opportunities for mitigation are lower than we expected. The combination of this reimbursement pressure, lower levels of generic deflation and lower brand inflation, resulted in Pharmacy margins that were worse than planned and 280 basis points below the same period last year.\nAlso included here is a 110 basis point impact due to the faster growth of the lower margin specialty business. And as we looked at the quarter, the year-on-year reimbursement impact was exceptionally high and we estimate an adverse timing impact of approximately 60 basis points.\nTurning next to our Retail business, Retail sales increased 1.3%, reflecting the sales contribution from the acquired Rite Aid stores. Comp Retail sales declined 3.8%, as we faced some headwinds during the quarter. We are lapping an exceptionally strong prior year cough, cold and flu season, and this accounted for 150 basis points of the year-on-year sales decline\nSecondly, we continued to de-emphasize tobacco, with an impact of around 125 basis points. And finally, we had a weak quarter in seasonal and gifting, with a 70 basis points impact. And here, we clearly need to improve our range and execution. Retail gross profit declined in the quarter, with Retail gross margin 90 basis points lower than prior year, predominantly due to short-term changes in promotional activity. But let me remind you that, excluding Rite Aid, our Retail gross margin has improved by approximately 290 basis points since 2015. That being said, while we are pleased with our long-term margin performance, we are clearly not satisfied with our recent front of store sales performance.\nNow, let me pass it to Alex, who will update you on our transformation priorities and explain the actions we are taking to address our current business challenges.\nAlex Gourlay -- Co-Chief Operating Officer\nThank you, James. While external factors, including reimbursement pressure and a weaker cough, cold and flu season impacted us in the quarter, we clearly need to improve our execution and speed of delivery. We have not moved quickly enough to address the changes in the market and as a result, did not deliver the growth required to help mitigate the continued reimbursement pressure.\nWith that context, let me share some of the actions we are focused on. Our overall transformation priorities are unchanged, but we are seeking to reinforce and accelerate our actions. As Stefano mentioned, we are accelerating the digitalization of our Company, transforming and restructuring our Retail offering, creating neighborhood health destinations based on more modern pharmacy and rolling out a transformational cost management program.\nOn cost management, we are continuing to make major strides and see more opportunities, which James will cover in more detail later. Overall, we recognize the importance of accelerating the transformation of our business more significantly to the customer. So let's look for a moment at some of the specific actions we are taking.\nFirstly, it is crystal clear that it all works only if we have the right talent, capabilities and operational focus. To that end, we have recently executed a comprehensive reorganization of my senior leadership team. We have announced a new leadership structure, which clearly delineates between development and delivery. This is allowing my senior executives to focus on driving operational excellence and delivering results in their specific area.\nWe have also made changes to how we manage our strategic partnerships, increasing the focus on accountability for developing our healthcare and retail services, ensuring financial discipline, pace, accountability and maximization of new profit streams. As Stefano mentioned, we have brought in a number of new senior executives to Walgreens Boots Alliance, with specific skills and expertise, and they will work closely with my team to drive performance improvements.\nWe are on track on digitalization. The Microsoft teams are on boarded, they are physically present in our offices and we have moved quickly to consolidate our internal digital teams to create a single team under an experienced Chief Digital Officer.\nWe have put in place new action plans for both Pharmacy and Retail. In Pharmacy, we have created a dedicated accountable team to drive volume through our partnerships with payers in the marketplace. This will allow the rest of the team to focus on operational effectiveness in our core Pharmacy business, delivering our vision of a modern pharmacy, driving efficiency and maximizing opportunities through outcomes-based reimbursement. These new approaches will help us counteract reimbursement pressure.\nIn Retail, we recognize the need to concentrate our efforts where we know we can win. Right now, our execution is lacking where it needs to be. We will continue to accept (ph) revenue declines in low margin countries, where we do not see a winning future path. We've invested some margin this quarter in countries we know drive footfall and we've already started to see the benefits of this investment in improved revenue and gross profits.\nWe will concentrate our efforts, shifting resources, people and dollars to our flagship brands, including Walgreens Healthcare brands and No7 and our priority categories. A great example is Health & Wellness. It's a significant category, with very attractive margins. We will step up the level of innovation and marketing support.\nWe continue to be pleased with the progress we're making on our partnerships. In particular, we're working closely with the Kroger executive team to determine how best to unlock future growth and synergies. And the work we are doing on digitalization of our business will deliver an enhanced customer experience and the tools and analytics to drive customer loyalty.\nThis spills on our existing highly successful customer-facing platforms, including our 5-star rated 55 million download of app and our 85 million active Balance Reward members. We've previously highlighted the very high customer retention rates we have delivered on the Rite Aid store optimization. These very favorable retention rates, which allow us to focus volume locally on fewer stores without reducing our geographic coverage, delivered greatly improved returns, and have led to our decision to boost our store optimization program from 600 stores to approximately 750 stores.\nParallel to this, we are undertaking a comprehensive review of Walgreens store networks to address specific underperforming stores. And as you know, we are testing a small-store format and pending positive results, we anticipate building out this format over the coming years. More information will follow in the coming months.\nI'll hand you back to James now to update you on Retail Pharmacy International.\nJames Kehoe -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Alex. As usual, I will report on the division's results in constant currency. Sales declined 1.2%, mainly due to a 1.3% decline in Boots UK in a challenging market. Adjusted operating income was down 2.1%, reflecting a 3.1% decline in Boots UK. While the quarter was helped by the positive impact of phasing in the UK, the trend has improved versus the first quarter, and the UK team are taking actions to further improve performance.\nUK comp Pharmacy sales declined 1.5%, mainly due to lower hospital revenues and revenue per item. Boots UK comp Retail sales declined 2.3%. The UK retail market remains challenging, but encouragingly we held market share in the quarter. Alex will now talk you through our Boots UK action plans.\nAlex Gourlay -- Co-Chief Operating Officer\nThank you, James. We're taking a balanced approach, with our actions focused on both boosting revenue growth and creating a lean operating model. Firstly, we have taken decisive action to reduce our UK cost base. In February, we announced our intention to reduce our Nottingham head office personnel costs by around 20% to create a smaller and more agile support team. Our smart spending, smart organization is advancing, and a store portfolio review is under way, focusing on low-performing stores and opportunities for consolidation. In addition, we are looking closely at our Pharmacy business to further improve efficiency and effectiveness.\nWe continue also to strengthen the Boots leadership team with the appointment of a new Chief Operating Officer. And as mentioned on last quarter's earnings call, we have multiple initiatives under way to improve our revenue performance. We are refitting 24 beauty halls across the UK between now and the end of May, introducing Boots Beauty Specialists, with an in-depth knowledge spanning all categories and brands. And we are significantly expanding our beauty offering by introducing more than 20 new on-trend brands nationwide over the next six months.\nFinally, a brief update on our international investments in China. Since the quarter end, in collaboration with our partner GuoDa, we opened our first pilot pharmacy in Shanghai, combining traditional Chinese medicine and skincare with well-known international brands.\nBack to James.\nJames Kehoe -- Chief Financial Officer\nTurning now to the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division, which we'll also discuss in constant currency, the division delivered another solid quarter, with sales up 9.1%, mainly due to growth in emerging markets, but also aided by a customer contract change in the UK, which contributed 2.1% of revenue growth. Adjusted operating income increased 3%, with sales growth and an improvement in SG&A as a percentage of sales, more than offsetting gross margin pressure.\nTurning next to cash flow, operating cash flow was $1.2 billion in the first half. Free cash flow was $401 million. This was impacted by headwinds of $1 billion, including increased cash tax payments of $465 million, mainly as a result of US tax reform, legal settlements of $276 million and a one-off working capital benefit of $233 million in the prior year.\nWorking capital days improved year-on-year, but the first half free cash flow reflects approximately $750 million of working capital increases, primarily due to higher sales and the timing of receipts. Cash capital investment was $793 million in the first half, $128 million higher than prior year due to the impact of Rite Aid store conversions.\nTurning now to our guidance for the year, in light of the first half performance and our expectations for a challenging second half, we are revising our full year guidance for fiscal year 2019. We now expect adjusted EPS to be roughly flat on a constant currency basis. However, given the normal level of volatility in a business of this size, realistically, you should expect a range of plus or minus 2%. The downward revision considers the following key changes.\nWe anticipate gross margins to remain under pressure in the US in the second half. Reimbursement pressure is unlikely to improve in the short term and it will take time for our complete mitigation plans to kick in. In terms of volume, our US Pharmacy and US Retail performance has been below plan in the first half of the year. And finally, we are taking decisive actions in the UK. Market conditions remain weak and we have reflected this in our revised guidance.\nGiven the revised full year EPS outlook, the estimated bonus payout for the year has been substantially reduced. And while our transformational cost management program is very much on track, the contribution to fiscal year '19 results was assumed when we provided guidance in December 2018.\nFinally, let me provide you with some supporting guidance assumptions. As you look forward to the second half, please remember that we have now lapped Rite Aid and we will continue to see adverse reimbursement pressure impacting the revenue line. Currencies have an adverse EPS impact of approximately $0.04 versus prior year, unchanged versus our guidance at the beginning of the year.\nWe now project a full year tax rate of 16% to 17%. The more favorable outlook reflects non-recurring discrete benefits and changes in our geographical mix of earnings. And we project full year share repurchases of $3.8 billion compared to $3 billion guidance at the beginning of the year. This contributes 4.5% to EPS growth.\nTurning to our long-term business model, firstly, we believe the business model is well positioned to deliver sustainable constant currency adjusted EPS growth well into the future. We have good line of sight to levers to counteract reimbursement pressure. Predictable volume growth and excellence in cost management will be key and this requires us to execute strongly against our existing transformation priorities.\nVolume growth will be underpinned by delivering improved value for both payers and consumers. We absolutely must drive a renewed focus on operational excellence, whether it be adherence, patient satisfaction, or management of our offering in the front of store. And we will see the benefits of our digitalization program with more frequent enhancements to our customer offer over the course of the coming months and years.\nFinally, in the UK, we expect our store and brand investments to begin to bear fruit as we exit 2019. Importantly, by 2022, we anticipate annual savings in excess of $1.5 billion from our transformational cost management program. And while a program of this magnitude is never easy, we do have good visibility on what needs to be done and strong commitment from the leadership team to get it done.\nBeyond 2022, we expect a rising contribution from partnerships. However, until then, our EPS growth model is not dependent on a material ramp-up of any of the existing partnerships. In fact, we are making significant investments in the short and medium term to drive long-term earnings upside. And long term, we do believe that healthcare and retail services will provide us with attractive returns and substantial new sources of income.\nLet me focus now on the transformational cost management program. Last quarter, we launched the program, targeting annual savings in excess of $1 billion. We also told you that we needed to complete a 16-week assessment phase. We are now three months in and while we are not fully complete, we do have a much deeper understanding of the areas of potential savings. Given what we've seen to-date, we are increasing our annual cost saving targets to at least $1.5 billion.\nSmart spending is progressing well. We have completed our benchmarking for select spend categories. For example, our benchmarks indicate that our consultant and supply costs are second quartile, while our contractor, events, technology and travel spend are all above the median of the peer set. This shows the granularity we're operating at and the potential we see to reduce costs.\nMoving onto smart organization, as a reminder, in the first quarter, we announced and implemented reorganizations and store closure initiatives to right-size operations in Chile and Mexico, and we launched an optimization initiative in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. We continue to move quickly and we took further decisive steps in the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, we announced a 20% reduction of the Boots UK central workforce, and the reduction should be largely complete by the end of the fiscal year.\nOn the 21st of March, we announced a new field management structure in the US. The new organization combines the previously separate Walgreens and Rite Aid store management teams and we expect the implementation to be completed by the beginning of June.\nThe final bucket is digitalization. We just completed a detailed review of our global IT spend, and we are very encouraged by the findings. We see opportunity to reduce our annual IT cash spend by $500 million to $600 million, almost equally split between OpEx and CapEx. This represents a reduction of approximately 25% to 30% versus the baseline costs. So it is a significant opportunity. In the short term, we plan to selectively invest part of the savings to build out new customer digital propositions. However, we will expect each project to drive incremental value and benefits, thus, creating a virtuous cycle.\nAs we look forward to 2020 and beyond, we see improved operational EPS performance. Over the long term, we are comfortable that our growth model can deliver mid to high single-digit adjusted EPS growth in constant currencies. One call out on fiscal 2020. We do anticipate growth from operations, however, adjusted EPS in constant currency is expected to be broadly flat due to the reduction in bonus payments in 2019.\nAs we built out our long-term business model, we made the following assumptions, which you may find helpful. We assume share repurchases of $1.7 billion per year, contributing approximately 2.5% to EPS growth. However, this is partly offset by tax rate, which is expected to increase from 16% to 17% in 2019 to over 18% by 2022, and creating a headwind of 50 basis points to 100 basis points, depending on the year.\nIn summary, we have reworked our business plans to accelerate and boost our existing transformation priorities. And while there may be quarterly fluctuations along the way, these plans should allow us to return to long-term adjusted EPS growth. I will now hand you back to, Stefano.\nStefano Pessina -- Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, James. As I said at the start, this has been a disappointing quarter. And I am equally disappointed that we had to reduce our full year guidance. However, we need to acknowledge the short-term headwinds we are facing. And while we are not that the only Company that has been impacted by the marked change in the environment, that's not an excuse. What is important now is that we respond quickly to ensure we return to growth as soon as possible.\nThis quarter has focused the minds of the entire team on the need to allocate resources to where they will have the greatest impact, both today and in the future. Importantly, I am convinced that our existing strategic priorities are the right ones, and our multi-year transformation program will allow us to deliver sustainable profitable growth.\nHowever, we have and will continue to reinforce and accelerate our actions to respond appropriately to the tougher environment we find ourselves in. Of course, in addition, from time to time, we have the opportunity for specific initiative to rebase our costs, often prompt by new technologies, practices or structure.\nYou have heard many examples from Alex and James, and we have significantly increased the goal for our transformation cost management program. We remain a global business, delivering billions of dollars in earnings and billions of dollars in cash flow, and generating real value for our shareholders, while being a huge force for good in the communities we serve, and society as a whole.\nDay in and day out, we continue directly or indirectly to be a core and vital part of the lives of a significant percentage of the world's population through presence and reach into the very heart of communities across the world.\nWe are not complacent. We must continue to evolve and innovate to thrive and as a management teams, we are more focused than ever on delivering operational and financial growth and value for owners. I can assure you there is innovation throughout our business, internally and outward facing, within our own teams, and in a wide range of partnerships. There are innovations in how we work, in our products and services, in how we interact with and serve our customers, both retail and commercial.\nSo despite the disappointment of the quarter under review and the impact that it will have on the year as a whole, I remain confident that in future, we can return to reliable mid to high single-digit earning per share growth from our businesses. And I remain committed to and confident of delivering real value for our customers, the communities we serve, my colleagues and most importantly, my fellow shareholders looking forward.\nThank you. Now we will take your questions.\nQuestions and Answers: Operator\n(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJohn Heinbockel -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst\nHey Alex. I wanted to ask the reorganization in the US, right, that you guys just announced, magnitude of savings? And then how do you guard against -- when you talk about operational excellence, guarding against doing that reorg in the current environment without disrupting the business further?\nAlex Gourlay -- Co-Chief Operating Officer\nHi. Good morning, John. It's Alex here. Yes. We've really reorganized the top organization to separate, develop and deliver, and in the delivery stage, we've got really three key roles now. One is driving the very important core business of Pharmacy and front-end sales, there's no changes there, apart from driving that more directly. And secondly, to look at future profit streams in areas like healthcare services, the healthcare hub project and also, the front-end in terms of really finding new models to drive the front end of our partnerships with Kroger, Birchbox and Sprint.\nThese are really focus areas. In terms of protecting the customer, we continue to move our money and our focus from the old model to the new model. That's been the trend for the last three, four, five years and that we continue to do. So along with the savings, there will be reinvestment into these new areas of growth and then, James will cover the reinvestment in a second to just to finish off the question. So we are very, very focused on the customer. We are very focused on end-to-end improvement of our operational execution, and that's why we've reorganized along with the opening up the opportunity to invest more in the future models.\nIn terms of investment, James, maybe you can pick up the cost and investment point.\nJames Kehoe -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. So, as you look forward, and we're quite clear on where we're targeting in excess of $1.5 billion of savings, bear in mind, you have inflation that offsets some of that, but the key one here is, are we investing for the future. And the way we've defined the program in general is, we want to save to invest to grow. And the way we measure success in the program is, we want to take the cost down and be the leanest operator in the industry. That's number one. But secondly, as we exit and execute against the program, we want to see top line benefits coming from this. So, there is one number I'm going to give you and I think it will concentrate your attention on both the achievability of the targets and our determination to drive a successful business longer term.\nWe will invest approximately $1 billion over the next three years in a combination of operating expense on capital. Approximately, 80% is operating expense. So, think about it for a minute, in one year, we will be putting in $300 million to boost the partnerships and to boost our capabilities on digitalization of the Company. So, we're not going to serve the business for the sake of hitting our cost pool, that's point number one.\nPoint number two is, more important is, each digital investment and each partnership has to stand on its own merits. We expect an attractive return and we expect long-term significant pools of income. And if you like, the plan is on one side conservative because we've put in the money to drive the partnerships and digitalization, and we haven't fully built in the benefits of the partnerships flowing through. So, if you like, the plan represents an option on the partnerships.\nJohn Heinbockel -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst\nOkay. Thank you very much.\nStefano Pessina -- Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nStefano here. Maybe you'll remember that I have always said that we had different ways of savings. And of course these ways had to be enabled by what we were doing in the Company. So, it's not a surprise that now we can announce a big program of savings and maybe a little bigger than we were thinking initially, but still even initially, we were thinking about something substantial. And this is possible because we have saved, but also invested in the past. And the reason why you don't see really the contribution of old joint ventures that we have done is that -- is because from one side we have some benefits, on the other side, we continue to invest in these joint ventures. And so you don't see the benefit for the time being, but these investments will mature and we will have at a certain time a substantial contribution of (inaudible). But rest assured that we continue to invest and we will not starve the business.\nJohn Heinbockel -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nRicky Goldwasser -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nYes. Hi. Good morning. So, question focused on the reimbursement rate cuts that you highlighted. Can you give us some sense of whether do rate cuts are coming from specific payers or PBMs, are you seeing them across the board? And really kind of like the question aims at, should we expect an acceleration in pressure for the remaining of fiscal year '19, or is the run rate that we're seeing for the quarter what we should model for the rest of the year?\nAnd then the follow-up question to that is, when we think about all the changes that are coming up in US healthcare, the proposed rebate rule on Part D, is a pretty significant one. So, how did you factor that one in when you think about 2020 in your comments around operating income growth in 2020?\nAlex Gourlay -- Co-Chief Operating Officer\nHi, Ricky. It's Alex here. I thing there is two separate things you have asked. So, I will give you where we are as we look forward with the reimbursement pressure. I think, as James said in his prepared remarks, this is a very heavy quarter for reimbursement pressure, and we expect that to be not the normal going forward. And I think he also said that the FEP, for example, in specialty, which is 110 basis points of the reduction, clearly -- and I mentioned that as well. So there is timing and then there is FEP and then there is the underlying reimbursement pressure. So I think that third number is the one that is a real underlying trend going forward. Again there's always contracts that start and end on Jan 1, particularly Med D. And again, we didn't see a really much difference to the trends as you spoke about before in Med D, they are really as we saw before.\nGoing to second question on the safe harbor and the changes in the government, it's really early on. We truly believe in transparency and we really believe in reducing out-of-pocket costs for drugs for patients across America. We support that really from day one, and therefore, we are working hard with other partners in the marketplace to understand how we can bring that forward with the government. And clearly, we don't know yet what that really means for any players in the marketplace. But we are working hard to innovate and to work with other partners and we'll give you an update as soon as we understand better the rules as (inaudible) the government.\nJames Kehoe -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. And maybe, Ricky, if I could add a couple of just facts to that. So what Alex says is correct. If you like, if you're thinking about your modeling Q3 at approximately 37% of the entire year's reimbursement impact -- Q2 , sorry, have the entire 37% versus a 25% expected run rate, so it was exceptionally high. And I think as you look forward to the second half, the reimbursement pressure will subside because there is this skew to the first half. The impact of the FEP contract as material as well, because year-to-date, it's around 140 basis points or 150 basis points. The specialty business will still grow very quickly, but the negative impact will tail off down to 30 basis points. So there will be quite a material change in the trajectory of the gross margin change year-on-year.\nAnd then secondly, as you look into next year, we believe we've planned our reimbursement levels roughly similar to what we've seen over the past couple of years. And I think individual quarters will always be extremely volatile and rocky, but over a longer term, while reimbursement is a bit over the trend rate this year, we have planned similar levels going forward. But as I said, we won't be -- we won't have this FEP contract next year. And one big thing that did hit us this year and is still hitting us and it's one of the reasons for the guidance is, we do have a lower level of generic utilization than we projected at the start of the year and that can have quite a material impact on both the revenue and on the cost line. So, it does -- if your generic utilization goes down, it does negatively impact your profitability.\nThat will be one potential tailwind that we will have, I would say, six months from now or 12 months from now. Because of contract changes in Med D, we would expect our generic utilization rates to increase, thus giving us some comfort around the gross margin outlook. I hope that's given you enough perspective.\nStefano Pessina -- Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nWe have always known and said openly that we expect growing pressure on margin from -- and from our contracts with out customers, it's up to us to find ways to compensate for this pressure. And till now, we have been able to do it. This Quote: , yes .The pressure maybe it's a little higher, but the problem is that we have been surprised by the pace of the three events that have contributed to the bad results for the quarter and for the year. And we knew that in any case the trend was in that direction and we're preparing. If we can react so quickly now is because we were thinking all the remedies and all the counteractions even before, we have not been probably quick enough in putting those counteractions in place and now we find ourselves a little behind the pressure that we see in the market. But we are confident that as we have individuate and we have worked for months to individuate all these elements, we are confident that in future we will be able to find the right remedies.\nRicky Goldwasser -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nRobert Jones -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks for the questions, I guess just to go back to the issue around reimbursement rate pressure. Outside of things like FEP being clearly a specific headwind to the year, I was always under the impression that the reimbursement rates coming into the year were something you guys were generally aware of. And so, could you maybe just explain the dynamic there that has the rates coming in so much worse than what you anticipated?\nAnd then, I guess the follow-up question to that would be, are we at a point with the PBMs, where you need to take a tougher stance? I mean, obviously, there is precedent for playing a little harder when it comes to declining reimbursement rates and just not offering the Walgreens network in certain PBM offerings. Is that on the table, is that kind of where the industry is at given this persistent reimbursement rate pressure?\nAlex Gourlay -- Co-Chief Operating Officer\nHi, Bob. It's Alex here. I think there is a combination of the headwinds that hit us in Q3 and hit is -- sorry, Q2, apologies, through the quarter. And I think James covered them off and they were as such, there was -- definitely, generic deflation was reducing, that is an impact that happened through the quarter, branded inflation was reducing that happened during the quarter. And of course, the volume to be honest with you as well was less than we had expected. Particularly, we had a pretty big -- a very big flu and cough and cold season last year, and it was early and this year it's been more normal and a little bit later. So these are all factors that hit us coming into that period. And I think also, at the end of the year we true up with our PBM partners the contracts for the year. And we don't really see the effect of that true up really until the middle of February, and that was another factor that happened as well. So it was a combination of headwinds that gave us this unusually high -- the highest quarter with, as James said, this fiscal year that created this reimbursement pressure.\nI think in terms of our attitude toward our partners in the supply chain, including the PBMs, we have a partnership approach. We are working with our partners to deliver better service, better products, including, for example, improving the ability for us to reduce costs elsewhere in the healthcare system. I'll give you one example of that. There's more money than ever before coming on the table for service-based payments, particularly in the Medicare D area and we again are working with partners toward the government to create a more common framework of KPIs that pharmacists can aim for in terms of getting repayments for example in Med D and (inaudible). And we have worked out very well in my view with Optum and United Health, and a very successful Medicare Advantage book of business, where again we got more payments than ever for performance based pharmacy.\nSo I think there is a recognition by our partners. The pharmacy is under pressure. I think there is a recognition by our partners, we want better joined op (ph) care within the healthcare system and then encouraging us through allowing incentives to invest more, as James has said, in these models and that's what we intend to do.\nRobert Jones -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nThanks for that. I guess just the quick follow-up. We haven't spent a lot of time on specialty and I know that's part of the US Retail business model. Anything worth calling out there, are you seeing similar headwinds or issues that you've called out on the core Retail Pharmacy business on the specialty side as well?\nAlex Gourlay -- Co-Chief Operating Officer\nIt's Alex again. Yes, I mean, our AllianceRx partnership has been a good one. You've seen the volume we've created, and additional sales we've created and we are happy with the operational standards and customer standards. But again, the margin is under pressure. There's no doubt that the economics of the specialty business is under pressure as the government is asking questions about how do we get these very important drugs to patients and consumers at lower costs. And we continue to work again with our partners, particularly Prime in this case and the Blues who own Prime, to really improve that model, both for the owners of the of Prime and ourselves, but also really important to more quickly provide a more local service for specialty. And particularly we're opening up more local community specialty pharmacies. We believe more and more that the mix model of center-fill and community pharmacy and based where the local spec doctors are is a right winning model than just a pure center-fill model, and we're encouraged by the success of these community pharmacies and by the adoption particularly by our partners at Prime.\nRobert Jones -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks, Alex.Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nKevin Caliendo -- UBS -- Analyst\nHi. Thanks for taking my call. I'd like to talk to you a little bit about the partnerships, you said you're going to have significant increased investments in these partnerships. Can you talk about which ones? I mean you've highlighted seven or eight different type of partnerships or pilot programs in the last year or so. Can you talk about which ones might be accelerated or which ones might become more of a focus, and can you talk to why that is the case?\nAlex Gourlay -- Co-Chief Operating Officer\nYes. Alex here. I mean I think the one that we should speak to the most this morning is definitely Microsoft, the digitalization of our Company. That's a really significant contract from our point of view, but also from Microsoft point of view. And it's also one that lasts over a number of years as we not just digitalize Walgreens, but we digitalize our partnership infrastructure both in the retail product side, and also importantly create new opportunities of partnerships in healthcare. So that by some way is the most important piece of what we're doing as we are investing the most our the money going forward to really create better tools for engagement for customers across both front-end and in pharmacy and better ways for our business partners to engage with our healthcare platform.\nWe're also very pleased with our partnership with Verily. We're really working pretty hard to bring real innovation quickly to the marketplace. They've developed a number of market ready tools. For example, OnDuo diabetes platform, which we are already active in our own population of healthcare beneficiaries here in Walgreens in the USA. And the adoption of that too is very satisfactory so far, and we believe that's another example of bringing new tools to market very quickly with new partnerships.\nOn the Retail side, I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks that we're very pleased with the rapid progress from a cost point of view and engagement in the Kroger trials in Northern Kentucky and Cincinnati. We're really very pleased with that and we expect to be able to move that test and trial further forward going forward. And of course that is more focused on creating two things, first of all, convenience in retail between a fantastic grocer and food brand in Kroger and obviously our pharmacy and healthcare and beauty brands here in Walgreens. And secondly, working to share data appropriately, so we can personalize the offer for many Americans who rely on these categories every single week and every single day, it's the more sticky categories because they are the ones most frequently used.\nBeyond that, Birchbox is in early stages, but going well. And Sprint, again, we announced the extension to 80 stores of Sprint. And last, but not least on the healthcare services side, LabCorp, where we continue to advance our LabCorp partnership with the ambition or the intention, should I say, to drive to 600 locations within the next three and half years.\nKevin Caliendo -- UBS -- Analyst\nCan I do a quick follow-up? I'm just thinking about this, and your pricing pressures are coming a lot from partners that you have. You have partnerships basically with all the PBMs in one form or another. Is there any place that you can take pricing or you have pricing power with some of your partners? I am not sure it's the PBM side necessarily, but can you push down on the consumer in any, way, shape or form? Can you push down on your wholesaling relationships, I mean with manufacturers? Can you talk a little bit about where you might have some increase or some pricing power going forward?\nAlex Gourlay -- Co-Chief Operating Officer\nYes. Alex here. Again, I don't see it as pricing power. I see it, as we join up with partnerships, who want to drive efficiency across the whole supply chain, so working with partners like AmerisourceBergen, working with partners like UnitedHealth, who are joining up processes, whether it be marketing processes or whether it be supply chain processes to drive cost between us, therefore driving better economics for the marketplace. And of course, better economics for our partners as well. So that's how we see it. We take -- we think our -- one of our most compelling strategies is partnership, the philosophy of creating value for each other over the long term, and which really brings efficiency and better quality of care to the marketplace. And we believe in this phase of change in the American healthcare system, for us, we think that's a very compelling part of our strategy.\nKevin Caliendo -- UBS -- Analyst\nThanks so much guys.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nCharles Rhyee -- Cowen -- Analyst\nYes. Thanks. And maybe just a follow-up on the partnership question and particularly as it relates to, Alex, your comment about the 600 LabCorp. I mean is that decision is -- at some point was that an acceleration of your strategy or has it always been sort of that plan? And I guess the question really is, at what point when you look at when these partnerships, they are looking like they're working or they will lead to success? Are we accelerating any of these more so than others currently? And when you think about that $300 million investment in the partnerships, is this is a larger number than maybe you had initially budgeted for, or has this had been always the number? Just trying to get a sense on internally if you're seeing greater success than you might have expected, or is this just, as in line?\nAlex Gourlay -- Co-Chief Operating Officer\nNo. It is definitely greater, particularly relative to rest of our cost base. So we have absolutely protected and driven more of our dollars into accelerating these partnerships. LabCorp, is a good example. We started that off really in the Gainesville -- as part of our Gainesville trial, and rapidly we agreed to extend to 600 stores nationwide within the four years. And we're having great conversations with the LabCorp team about what more we can do. Secondly, I would say that the partnership with Microsoft, I mentioned already, is a clear acceleration of the digitalization of our Company along with recruiting internally a lot of a -- particularly a Chief Digital Officer. And there's more people coming in really to drive the modernization of our platform and processes to become a new retail and healthcare company. That's a very important acceleration in investment.\nAnd thirdly, I would say that we are encouraged by Kroger. Again, I go back to the importance of food, the importance of footfall in our stores and we recognize that we have a very low market share in food and we recognize that Kroger is a food expert, and a national food expert here in the US. And we're encouraged with the money we've spend in the early tests and trials, and we believe there is more to test and trial for sure, before we can be certain of this, but we see a reason to move forward faster with Kroger.\nJames Kehoe -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. And just to clarify, of the $300 million, approximately 60% is on partnerships. The other 40% is on digital initiatives, and the digitalization of the Company. So, I think, about 40% will actually improve execution in Pharmacy, in Retail, back-office, everywhere, which is the digital investment, and the 60% is specifically on the partnerships. And I think what distinguishes this versus the plans we would have put together 12 months ago would be that the plans are fully funded. So we've actually -- we're funding ahead of the revenue in the plan, because the targets we give, we want to be absolutely sure that we can deliver upon the long-term growth model and we won't do that if we under fund the future drivers of the business. So it is quite different than the plan we would have done a year ago. It's just much more, I don't want to use the word, generous, but it's well funded in terms of what we need to get done.\nCharles Rhyee -- Cowen -- Analyst\nOne partnership you haven't talked about or you haven't really mentioned (ph) is Humana. Just curious how that one is going? I know that Humana themselves spoke pretty positively about the trends they're seeing. And I guess to that extend when you look at the partnership and you mentioned footfall Alex, are you able to calculate the uptick in foot traffic that the partnerships bring to you for each of the different partners?\nAlex Gourlay -- Co-Chief Operating Officer\nI mean, yes, absolutely. I mean clearly, driving more patients and customers into our corner store is really important to us and we can absolutely measure that as part of the business case as James mentioned. And that's why I mentioned primarily Kroger. For sure, Humana is a good partnership, we are partners in primary care, it's a senior model, it's been well put together to create a complete offer for the senior, including the pharmacists been part of the morning huddle, for example, with the primary care doctors and the nurse practitioners. And the signs are encouraging. The signs are encouraging as the Humana team said, and we're still in the very early stages. A bit like Birchbox (inaudible), Humana is a very important test and trial for us, as we focus more on the senior and more on primary care.\nCharles Rhyee -- Cowen -- Analyst\nWould you see that that's replacing more of your -- the retail clinics that maybe several years ago you had embarked on more of a retail clinic model, do you see that this could be more of the go-to-model for delivering more this care in the store format?\nAlex Gourlay -- Co-Chief Operating Officer\nYeah. It's really early days, to be honest. And of course we need to see the return on that money, clearly. But for sure, we know the model. And the clinics for us did not give us the returns that we expected. And we've been working to improve the profitability, and to be honest, the customer and patient care in these clinics by working closely with healthcare systems across the USA. So we've already altered that model quite a long way, and we are happy with that model. So we think that the full line (ph) primary care, particularly focused on seniors is a really interesting model, and we see that more of our future then the episodic clinics, the retail clinics that we had before.\nCharles Rhyee -- Cowen -- Analyst\nAll right. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nMichael Cherny -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGood morning. And thanks for all the color so far. There was a comment made about generic utilization being lower than expected. As we think about all of the moving pieces in terms of script growth versus the reimbursement pressures, any sense as to why that was the case? And was it portend in terms of your expectations for script growth going forward, particularly since you do have a look at how some of the preferred networks and Part D networks have performed so far year-to-date?\nAlex Gourlay -- Co-Chief Operating Officer\nYes. So I think, Mike, it was simply due to the fact that we lost a major book of business. The Aetna book of business went from preferred to non-preferred to 12 months ago. So 1/1/19, we anniversaried that loss of book of business. And we've been satisfied with the growth of our Med D business from that date. So, we anniversaried that out and I would say, we are growing very nicely with United. We became preferred with Cigna, and therefore, we are happy that we are now back to good, solid market base, market growth with Med D, and seniors. Because seniors are usually on more medication and usually more generic medication, we are seeing generic utilization start to rise and that's what we have planned going forward as James said in his (inaudible) another question. So I think that's the reason for it. And again, I think we're satisfied that we are now back to our normal growth, market growth in Med D.\nMichael Cherny -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nAnd then, just one other quick question. You talked about $700 million or so give or take in buybacks for the rest of the year. If you're doing $3.1 billion in the first half of the year, any thought process behind some of the rationale for that change and when are you able to start to buy back shares again?\nJames Kehoe -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, we can start buying back shares in the next couple of days. And as we said, we currently project to repurchase $3.8 billion this year. And just as the planning stands for the next three years, we didn't want our guidance to be over reliant on share repurchases, so we've $1.7 billion each year. So as you look to the next three years, about 2.5 percentage points of growth comes from buybacks, with some offset coming from the tax rate that's turning negative. So as we look to mid-single digit. If you call that kind of like a 6% to 8%, we see the core business growing at 3.5% to 5.5%, excluding the use of cash for capital allocation. So the remainder of this year is just to get back, be in the market on a particularly constant basis. And hope that covers your question.\nMichael Cherny -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nThanks.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Ann Hynes from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nAnn Hynes -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. I know you addressed cash flow on the call, but it did seem very weak even if you ex some of the Rite Aid benefits last year. Can you give any type of cash flow guidance for fiscal '19? And then secondly, I'm not sure if, recent results changed your view on M&A going forward. I know you've been focused more on the strategies, but does this change your view on capital deployment going forward? Thanks.\nJames Kehoe -- Chief Financial Officer\nOn cash flow, yes, we had a pretty rocky quarter and we've got a -- not surprises, but we have a couple of headwinds that we will face this year. So if you step back from this and look back over the last couple of years, this is a business that can deliver pretty comfortably somewhere in the region of $5 billion, $5.5 billion, to $6 billion cash flow depending on the year. Now, as you as you compare one year to another, you always have -- you're always lapping something or of some sorts. This year, we have about $2.3 billion of headwinds. So I think as you think through a normal level of cash flow, which is somewhere north of $5 billion, we have to manage through cash taxes, this year, which are $900 million higher than in the previous year. We're cycling through legal payouts of $300 million and then we have large movements as a result of Rite Aid, almost $1 billion. So the cash flow this year will be well below the trend right. But we have developed trigger or a plan in some support of our guidance and we're quite comfortable on the long-term cash flow generating power of the Company. And actually quite --I would even go so far with saying as, I think when you look at some of our payment terms with suppliers and some of the way we manage inventory, we probably have large doses of opportunity.\nAnd then the final comments on cash flow, as you look at this year, our cash capital expenditures are exceptionally high. They are about $300 million or $400 million higher than the run rate and that's essentially the conversion of the Rite Aid stores. So, it's quite a huge exercise because we took on 1,900 stores. As you saw from Alex, we are raising the store closures to 750, but that still leaves the conversion of 1,200 stores. And by the way, the Rite Aid acquisition has gone extremely well. The return on investment is exactly where we wanted it to be. We're getting there in a different way and actually, we're very encouraged by the retention we're getting as we optimize the stores. So cash flow this year will be somewhat problematic, but we're quite confident on the future outlook.\nAnn Hynes -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\nCould you see a normalized level in fiscal 2020?\nJames Kehoe -- Chief Financial Officer\nSorry.\nAnn Hynes -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\nCould you see that normalized level in 2020?\nJames Kehoe -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. I think we will definitely plan to be at a normalized level in 2020. We have enough initiatives lined up against the cash flow targets. We have strong capital efficiency programs ongoing, so we're quite comfortable on the -- on that kind of -- getting back to that level quite quickly.\nAnn Hynes -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\nOkay. And just on my M&A question?\nStefano Pessina -- Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nWhat the -- M&A what --\nAnn Hynes -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\nYes. I wasn't sure if the recent results and the deteriorating backdrop of the retail pharmacy industry would change your views on M&A going forward?\nStefano Pessina -- Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nNo. Our view is still the same. We are not close to any deal provided the price is right. We don't see any reason to use our cash overpaying for something just because there is a deterioration of the market. If anything, we have to be more careful now when we buy something because if we don't believe that the market will turn around, we have to action more carefully. Honestly, we still believe in this market. We still believe that this market is a market for the future, a big market with continuous growth, but to buy something, we must be sure that the money that we employ will come back sooner or later.\nAnn Hynes -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\nOkay. Great. Thank you,\nGerald Gradwell -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations\nKrista, we do have some more times so we'll take a couple of more questions.\nOperator\nCertainly. Your next question comes from the line of Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nErin Wright -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you. Can you remind us of your strategy in specialty pharmacy, is this an area where you could build out further in terms of your capabilities there, as well as, I think you updated us on the Prime and Express relationship, but also do you think you're competitively positioned in specialties? Thanks.\nAlex Gourlay -- Co-Chief Operating Officer\nYes. So, hi. It is Alex here. And I think as I said before, we are investing in community pharmacies in particular. These are ones which are very close to the specialists doctors and often also very close to hospitals where specialist doctors operate. And that's going really well for us. And we're also investing in our relationships with AllianceRx. And of course we've set a buying grip effectively with Express Scripts. So, we very active in this space. We know it's 50% in the market going forward, we know this is where the innovation is coming from our pharmaceutical partners. We continue to work with them on potential new models of how you can actually take the drugs and more precisely and more directly to these patients who require these not only they are very, very important drugs, but more personalized drugs. So we are working on all fronts. It's a really important thing for us and we are investing what we think in the future of this model. And I go back to, again, we think the central fill here is important, but it's not the only way that you can bring these products and these very important drugs to the marketplace.\nErin Wright -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nOkay. Thanks. And leveraging your LabCorp relationship what more could you potentially do there, potentially under contract research side with clinical trials and what sort of extensions do you contemplate with that LabCorp relationship? Thanks.\nAlex Gourlay -- Co-Chief Operating Officer\nObviously, our relationship with LabCorp is really strong. And also we've built in Walgreens Boots Alliance, in our development function, what we call, Fine Care, which really is a platform for been able to attract, engage customers in their own healthcare, both episodic and long-term chronic conditions, and have launched a number of different solutions there. So we think that the platform of the pharmacies with LabCorp, along with the digital platforms we are building will give manufacturers a lot of new opportunity to engage with us in different ways. And one of the ways they can engage with us is speeding up their really important innovations to the marketplace. The wholesale business under Ornella's leadership has fantastic relationships globally with the biggest manufacturers across the world. And you can be assured that we are in conversations to try and join op, how do we bring the right patients, every stage of the development of these drugs to our partners in the marketplace, so we can speed up delivery of new innovations and reduce costs in healthcare.\nErin Wright -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nLisa Gill -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\nThanks very much. I had a couple of follow-up questions first would be around on the technology side. So, James, you talked about being able to cut some technology costs, but as we think about the potential changes with this rebate rule, it potentially could put it in the hands of the retailers to now have to do point of sale and then figure out a charge back, et cetera. Do you feel like you have the systems you need today or would there be incremental investments that you would have to make if we actually see what is proposed come about?\nJames Kehoe -- Chief Financial Officer\nI will take a shot and maybe pass it over to Alex. We think, yes, we need incremental investments, that's why we mentioned this $300 million a year. 40% would go on digital and we have two large programs going on in the US right now, one is retail finance transformation, which effectively is the front of store plus all the back office, and the program is going well and would be complete in end 2020. And then what we call our RxRenewal, which is a renewal of all of the pharmacy systems, and that's a longer program, that's a much more integrated with the digital journey we're on. And that will take a number of years. These are fully funded in any guidance we've given, and they are quite transformational in terms of the way the Company will operate. We will obviously leverage them to reduce cost to fill across the Company, back office, but equally so to engage more deeply with the consumer, the front-of-store and with patients as they come in for the pharmacies. So it's like a win-win across the entire Company.\nAlex Gourlay -- Co-Chief Operating Officer\nAnd this is Alex here. Yeah. Specifically looking at how do we get a transparency in the point of care, both the doctor's office, and also the pharmacy and to have that more open network. And our work -- as you remember, early on, we did some work with (inaudible) on creating a new model, a direct to pharmacy model for a cash payment. So again, we've been working this opportunity for three years, and I think is -- and we remain convinced that these models will be very important to the future as more demands are placed on price visibility and more patients are paying more and more out of pocket for the drugs.\nLisa Gill -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\nOkay. Great. And then my second follow-up would just be around the comments on the acquisition strategy. Clearly, a lot of questions today around your partnerships and what you have in the marketplace. You haven't made an acquisition in the last few years since Rite Aid. We know that it's a tough reimbursement environment on the retail side. But if you or Stefano can talk about what are the things that you target? And I know Stefano you made the comment that you have to pay the right price, but there has been talk historically about would it make sense for you to buy the rest of Amerisource, are there ways that you want to build the relationship in the healthcare neighborhood, right? So is it, what are the kinds of things that you're thinking about that would accelerate that strategy from an M&A perspective?\nStefano Pessina -- Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I have to tell you, I can just give the same answer that I have given in the past. We are open to any kind of partnership which makes sense, which is compatible with what we are doing, provided the price is correct and provided that the organization of the company that we buy or that we merge is compatible with us, because the price is very important but also if you don't have a compatible teams, at the end the merger will not work and you will not be able to deliver synergies. We are constantly reviewing a certain number of companies. Don't ask me the names. I cannot give you the names. But of course, until now, we have not found the right numbers to do a combination with these companies.\nLisa Gill -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\nAnd is that right number more of an absolute number, or does it have to do with where your stock is currently trading? Because I think that, as we look at this, could you potentially make an acquisition to be able to enhance your offering or to diversify from some of the issues we see in the marketplace today?\nStefano Pessina -- Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, but our share price is relative, it depends on the share price of the target. If we have more or less the same multiple, the share price is not a problem. If we have a very different multiple, the share price can be a problem. But we still have a certain possibility, a certain room for additional depth. So, some acquisition could be done mainly financing them through cash, but I repeat, it's not the absolute value of our shares which counts, it's the relative value.\nLisa Gill -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\nStefano Pessina -- Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you very much.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nRoss Muken -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGood morning, guys. So two things. One, as we think about in the rest of retail, a lot of the fears that existed and what companies ultimately have done, and I'm thinking about Walmart and Home Depot and some of the more traditional guys, they have basically pursued, one, sort of omni-channel approach, and I think you guys have talked a lot about technology investments today. But two, there's just been in general a big downsizing of boxes in a lot of different areas and a consolidation in the industry. That's the one thing that's lacking here. Obviously, you guys are closing more stores than what we saw in the past.\nBut how do you think about the state of pharmacy and the competitive landscape, because if we think about what's driving possibly some of the reimbursement pressure outside of lower brand, some of it is still the fact that we over boxed across the US, maybe by a substantial amount. And so, how do you think about that in the context of what you can control and what you can't control and how you expect some of the smaller peers, I guess, to play out over the next couple of years?\nAlex Gourlay -- Co-Chief Operating Officer\nHi, Ross. This is Alex here. Yeah. We really believe and our strategy is based on our stores, but our stores have had a one size fits all mindset since the Walgreens strategy was created in the US in particular. So we're reformatting and reshaping our stores against the priorities that we spoke about earlier on. And secondly, we have a strategy in retail to become even stronger in pharmacy, to really strengthen our healthcare products and services and solutions, and also continue drive our beauty differentiation in the marketplace or partner with others to take care of other categories.\nAnd lastly, but not least, we have 85 million loyalty cardholders and we believe that data analytics are really important to understand how you personalize the offer with our pharmacy led health and beauty specialist and how you work with others to create real personalization and marketing. So that's our strategy. We think our stores are our strength. We have to reorganize them and reshape them over the next five to 10 years, and that we are on the journey to do that.\nRoss Muken -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nThanks. And just maybe just going back to the guidance again, particularly on the multiyear basis. I guess coming off of obviously what's a very disappointing period, as you try to ring fence some of these risks, particularly around reimbursement and just pricing and then incorporated your view on again some of the policy changes, I guess, how did you sort of build confidence that mid-to-high singles was the correct range and the correct goal? And that with what you can do, obviously, on the cost side, you'd be able to get there, and thinking about that, particularly in the context of just underlying operating income growth, which obviously this year is pretty challenged, and we've still got some uncertainty possibly in the back half?\nJames Kehoe -- Chief Financial Officer\nSo maybe let me cover first the back half and then I'll move on to the three-year. As you look through the back half, we did say that (inaudible) the issue on gross margins in the pharmacies in Q2. We do expect some continuation into Q3 and then an improvement in Q4. So as you plot out quarters, I would assume a fairly even split in the EPS between the two quarters, maybe 49, 51. So Q3 will be worse and Q4 will be improving. We actually -- we set ourselves a different goal when we pulled together, and it's not really guidance, it's a growth model. And we set back and we went through very, very detailed reviews with each of the business leaders and here is the goal we set ourselves. We wanted a set of realistic goal, mid-to-high single digit. We spent a lot of time on the levers to offset reimbursement, particularly on the assumptions around generic deflation, and the ability of our generic purchasing organization to deliver significant offsets.\nAnd we're comfortable that the generic team can offset approximately 50% to 60% of the reimbursement impact. Then we went through each single volume assumption, particularly Pharmacy, but also in the Retail business. And really don't want it to be lost on the audience the changes we're making in Retail. And one is, this business went from a loss-making business three years ago to quite a profitable Retail business now. So we are from a starting point to a position of strength, but with a weak top line delivery. And the big change will be, we will distort and we refocus our resources on Health & Wellness, and beauty, and that's where we can win and we know we can win and are very attractive businesses. And then we will build partnerships with companies like Kroger to address the other parts of retail and we very convinced that we have line of sight to improving top line.\nThe second part is, we said, can we let's put in what we can control. And you can control your cost journey and we've built in $1.5 billion. We've put a strong governance around it, and we will be resolute in delivering, and I emphasize, at least $1.5 billion of cost reduction. So that has a high degree of probability. And then the final thing which we said at the beginning was, it's not -- you can't cut yourself the glory. So we built in the investments required to drive the top line. So we have the right investments, $300 million a year, which -- it adds up to $1 billion of investments behind partnerships and digital. So we're investing to make sure especially that the US business has the ammunition required to create that omni-channel experience in both Pharmacy and in Retail, so that we do get the volume delivery that creates a virtuous cycle. And that's the reason why we are actually quite confident that the growth model for the three years is founded in a lot of fact and actually it's quite a detailed plan we've developed internally.\nAnd the question we got earlier, does it translate the cash? And the answer is yes. We see a line of sight in consistently deliver in that $5 billion type range that we've done in the past. We see no reason why the business can't do something similar into the future. And as what Stefano said, in the past, we're very disappointed with the quarter and the requirement to take down guidance and that's made us resolute that we've put in place very tangible plans to make sure we don't have to do that again. And that's the commitment from the management team.\nGerald Gradwell -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations\nThank you. And I'm afraid, we are now out of time. Better place to end. So we -- obviously, I know a lot of you didn't get to ask questions on the call. The IR team here are available for the rest of week to answer any questions you may have. And we will look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Thank you very much indeed. Krista would you like to close the call?\nOperator\nAnd this concludes today's conference call.
