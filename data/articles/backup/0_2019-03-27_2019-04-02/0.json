(Courtesy photo) PRINT | JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-Lackland, Texas --\nPreston Kemp, 38th Engineering Squadron cyber engineer, presented the results of an Air Force engineering prototype study to attendees during a Federal Aviation Working Group event, hosted by Apple, Inc., in Austin, Texas, March 13, 2019.\nThe event served as a technical interchange between Department of Defense service members and contractors, commercial vendors, and Apple federal team members, all focused on better equipping pilots and aircraft maintainers to perform their work using alternative computing platforms for greater functionality and capability.\nAlthough commercial mobile technologies have been used in this area for nearly a decade, the 38th ES identified a gap in how these devices are being managed and supported. The result of months of prototyping and partnering with industry and other federal agencies is a Macintosh operating system-powered device that interfaces with the existing Air Force Network.\nThe effort directly supports pilots and maintainers to better enable them to innovate how they accomplish their missions every day.",

            "text": "DALLAS- New Concept Energy, Inc. (NYSE American: GBR), (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cNCE\u201d) a Dallas-based oil and gas company, today reported Results of Operations for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018. During the three months ended December 31, 2018 the Company reported a net loss of $55,000 or ($0.005) per share, compared to a net loss of $2,851,000 or ($1.39) per share for the same period ended December 31, 2017\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2018 the Company reported a net loss of $484,000 or ($0.21) per share, compared to a net loss of $3,246,000 or ($1.59) per share for the same period ended December 31, 2017.\nOn December 4, 2018, the Company issued an additional 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock to a single investor for cash of $4,500,000 to increase stockholders\u2019 equity by $4,440,000 after issuance costs. The issuance of 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock resulted in a change in control of the Company, as the investor now owns approximately 59.6% of the outstanding Common Stock. The issuance of the 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock increased the total number of shares issued and outstanding to 5,131,935 shares.\nRevenues: Total revenues from the oil & gas operation was $682,000 in 2018 and $791,000 in 2017. The decrease was due to the rate the Company received for the sale of its natural gas during 2018.\nOperating Expenses : Operating expenses for continuing oil & gas operations was $844,000 in 2018 and $1,027, 000 in 2017. This decrease was principally due to a reduction of depreciation and depletion expense of $73,000. The remaining decrease was the result of an overall reduction in operating expenses.\nIn 2017 pursuant to the requirements of the \u201cfull cost ceiling test\u201d for oil & gas companies we recorded a non-cash charge to operations of $2.6 million to write down its investment in Ohio and West Virginia. This charge to earnings was caused by a revaluation of the Company\u2019s non-producing oil and gas reserves.\nCorporate Expenses were $353,000 in 2018 and $408,000 in 2017. The decrease was principally due to a reduction in payroll expenses.\nInterest Expense : Interest Expense was $18,000 in 2018 as compared to $24,000 in 2017. The decrease was due to a reduction in the long-term debt.\nAbout New Concept Energy, Inc.\nNew Concept Energy, Inc. is a Dallas-based oil and gas company which owns oil and gas wells and mineral leases in Ohio and in West Virginia.

            "text": "Bill Fernandez holds an Apple I.\nPhoto courtesy of Bill Fernandez EDITOR'S NOTE : This article was originally published on December 8, 2014 and is being republished today to commemorate Apple's 43rd anniversary (April 1, 1976).\nAt Apple, Bill Fernandez rode shotgun on the creation of the personal computer industry. He was on the original Mac team that made decisions that defined the modern user experience. He worked on QuickTime, which helped define Web video. He worked on HyperCard, which helped inspire HTML and the Web. So clearly, the man has some ideas about what makes a user interface work.\nHe also gets props for this: He's the guy who introduced Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.\nFernandez became the first official full-time employee at what was then known as Apple Computer Inc. Except for a brief absence early on, he remained with Apple until 1993 and became an expert in user interfaces.\nI wrote an in-depth feature on TechRepublic about Fernandez's remarkable career . During the interviews with Fernandez, I got to pick his brain about the current state of user interfaces, his take on cutting-edge technologies, and what's next in computing. Not all of that material made it into the TechRepublic long form article, so I've pulled it together here -- there's a lot of wisdom about today's challenges in UI and a gut check on the sci-fi visions of the future.\nI broke down Fernandez's comments into the most forward-looking topics.\nThe current state of UI \"The true user interface is the gestalt of many things: industrial design, ergonomics, internal hardware, performance, error handling, visual design, interaction, latency, reliability, predictability, and more. For this reason I'm glad to see my profession moving from the concept of user \"interface\" (where the user interacts with the screen) to user 'experience' (where more the above factors are considered),\" said Fernandez.\n\"I can design the best user interface in the world on paper, but if it's not implemented well by the hardware and software engineers (e.g. the product is slow or buggy) then the product will fail. If you do a really good job of designing a product then everyone who sees it thinks it's so obvious that they could have done it themselves.\"\nNow playing: Watch this: Wozniak on humans and technology 0:50 The challenge of flat design \"We are in a time of transition, and like the water becomes brackish where river water meets the ocean, the state of UI design is messy,\" said Fernandez. \"There's some great stuff out there, much more than there used to be, but there's still a lot of trash, and there's a lot of well-meaning but misguided efforts. One example of this is in the migration from three-dimensional, photorealistic UI elements (window frames, push buttons, sliders, etc.) to 'flat' UI design. Years ago a friend asked what I thought Web pages of the future would be like and I said 'like magazines.' I thought we'd see flatter designs, expert typography, beautiful, magazine-advertisement-like page layouts, etc. That prediction is coming true with the trend toward 'flat' UI design...\n\"But in moving towards flat design we are losing much of the wisdom that was embedded in the old 3D style of UI, for example: a user must be able to glance at a screen and know what is an interactive element (e.g., a button or link) and what is not (e.g., a label or motto); a user must be able to tell at a glance what an interactive element does (does it initiate a process, link to another page, download a document, etc.?); the UI should be explorable, discoverable and self-explanatory. But many apps and websites, in the interest of a clean, spartan visual appearance, leave important UI controls hidden until the mouse hovers over just the right area or the app is in just the right state. This leaves the user in the dark, often frustrated and disempowered.\"\nTech's biggest obstacle Bill Fernandez talks to Homebrew Computer Club members at the reunion in 2013.\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET \"There have always been dreamers and visionaries of the future: flying cars, personal jetpacks, video phones, cashless payments, etc. The limitation has always been the hardware technology, which is always the limiting factor both in what is possible and in what is affordable by the masses,\" said Fernandez. \"There are technological advances of the last decade in batteries, semiconductor sensors, low-power systems-on-a-chip, displays, spread-spectrum radio protocols, etc. that are just now finding their way into products. It seems unlikely to me that we're just around the corner from having teleportation, boundless free energy, interdimensional travel or magic that effortlessly transmutes lead into gold. But I do expect the relentless progress in science and technology to continue, and progressively for the science fiction of the past to become the hot new consumer product of today.\n\"Look for lots of new categories of personal devices -- like personal health trackers -- to emerge over time. One of the big things holding back the development of many kinds of products is our batteries. At present there's a new wave of wrist-mounted devices -- from Pebble, Google, Motorola, Samsung -- but batteries are really holding back what is possible. When a watch battery can hold as much energy as a car battery, and a large-screen computer-display-projector can be built into a watch, look for all your smartphone apps and capabilities to migrate into a wrist-mounted device rather than a belt-mounted device.\"\n'Minority Report'-like touch panels \"The idea of having the transparent panels like you see on 'Minority Report' and 'Iron Man' and 'Avatar' are for the most part, impractical,\" said Fernandez. \"By waving your arms, you don't get any precision. Tony Stark in 'Iron Man,' he's designing things. In real life, he'd have to spend hours drawing schematics, making precise mechanical diagrams, and there's no way you're going to do that in the air waving your hands. Your arms are going to become tired. So that's not really practical. It looks really good on the screen when you can take the camera through one of these displays to a person... But in real life people don't actually have that stuff...\n\"On the other hand, when we have things like 'Blade Runner,' which showed advertisements on every surface and when you saw 'Minority Report' where you'd walk down a hallway and an ad would be shown to you that's targeted, that's very definitely part of our media future. We already have it on websites, where you get targeted ads on each page that you go to. And [with] Apple's iBeacons where you can put your beacons in stores and your phone can show you ads for products that you're passing by. So, we're definitely stepping into that world.\"\nGoogle Glass \"Years before Google announced their Glass project I used to paint this picture of the future: We will see a time when folks will be sitting in Starbucks gazing off into the distance, twitching their heads, waving their hands in mystical-looking incantations, and muttering to themselves,\" Fernandez said.\n\"Why? Because they will have projectors projecting virtual data screens into their eyes. As they move their heads their virtual data screens will update to show things (books, bookcases, apps, etc.) that they have arranged in space around them. Rings on their fingers will sense the positions, orientations and gestures of their hands. Voice interaction will let them speak voice commands and hear synthetic speech. So, for example, a user will turn his/her head to see a book, reach up to grab it and drag it down in front of him/her. Use a voice command to open the book to a section of contacts, use a combination of voice commands and gestures to find a desired contact, point to the one he/she wants and say 'dial that one.' So there will be a seamless, multimodal UI experience using sight, sound, voice, head motion, arm movement, gestures, typing on virtual keyboards, etc. There have been pieces of this in research for decades. Only now are we beginning to see some of these things emerge into the consumer market: with Google Glass, Siri, etc. We have further to go, but we're on the road.\"\nOculus Rift \"Oculus Rift is an interesting thing in that finally it looks like someone is putting high-quality virtual reality scenes into a product that will be affordable. It is, of course, going to be of very limited use because you have to be sitting somewhere. You can't be [using it] going about your daily life or driving a car,\" said Fernandez.\n\"[But] I like seeing things like Oculus Rift and Google Glass as kind of steps in the direction of actually bringing this vision I've had for years to life. So that's very interesting to see that happening in little baby steps.\"\nRead TechRepublic's in-depth story: \"Apple's first employee: The remarkable odyssey of Bill Fernandez\"\nApple's biggest milestones 17 Photos ",

            "text": "Apple had a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad week \u2014 here\u2019s what happened By - April 1, 2019\nComing off a week of surprise product-related announcements , Apple was expecting to have a great week to close out March. The company held a star-studded event in Cupertino, California, where it unveiled its ambitious TV plans. But a handful of not-so-great things also happened to Apple last week.\nLast Monday, Apple held a big event at the Steve Jobs Theater at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, where it unveiled a handful of new premium services: for news and magazines, video games, and TV shows.\nApple\u2019s big event went off without a hitch. Hollywood A-listers like Steven Spielberg and Reese Witherspoon unveiled exclusive new shows for Apple\u2019s TV Plus service , and CEO Tim Cook spent quality time with Oprah Winfrey during and after the event.\nBut that was just Monday. The rest of the week was not so glamorous for Apple.\nHere\u2019s what happened. MONDAY: The week started off pretty good! Apple unveiled three new premium services at its big event: Arcade, News Plus, and TV Plus.\nLots of celebrities showed up to plug their upcoming shows for Apple TV Plus, including Jennifer Aniston, Jason Momoa, J. J. Abrams, and Kumail Nanjiani. Oprah Winfrey even made an appearance to talk about her two original documentaries coming exclusively to Apple TV Plus.\nIt was a star-studded event \u2013 but Apple didn\u2019t announce a price or even a launch date for Apple TV Plus, making some scratch their heads. TUESDAY: One day after Apple announced its subscription service for magazines and newspapers, Apple\u2019s News app crashed on both iOS and Mac devices. source Business Insider / Screenshot\nApple fixed the crashing issues later in the day, but once the service became operational, people complained about the app\u2019s lack of intuitiveness . TUESDAY: Apple continued its patent fight with Qualcomm, with a judge from the US International Trade Commission ruling that Apple\u2019s iPhones infringed on a Qualcomm patent. source Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\nThe ruling isn\u2019t final, but the judge recommended an import ban on iPhones that violate the patent \u2013 specifically, the iPhone 7 lineup, the iPhone 8 lineup, and iPhone X models that use Intel\u2019s chips \u2013 which would prevent them from being sold in the US. A panel of judges would need to approve this ruling before it could move on to a presidential review.\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Apple was found to have not infringed on a handful of separate Qualcomm patents in a second ruling the ITC handed down on Tuesday.\nApple said in a statement to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman that Qualcomm was using these patent cases \u201cto distract from having to answer for the real issues, their monopolistic business practices.\u201d WEDNESDAY: Apple finally issued its first apology to MacBook owners still experiencing keyboard issues. source Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\nAn Apple representative said in a statement to Business Insider : \u201cWe are aware that a small number of users are having issues with their third-generation butterfly keyboard and for that we are sorry. The vast majority of Mac notebook customers are having a positive experience with the new keyboard.\u201d\nOwners of Apple\u2019s MacBook laptops \u2013 specifically those with butterfly keyboards \u2013 have been experiencing issues since Apple redesigned its keyboards to be thinner around 2015. Even after two redesigns of that keyboard, people have complained about persisting issues such as common keys like E and R not registering or over-registering.\nMultiple class-action lawsuits over these keyboards have been filed against Apple, and 35,000 people have signed a Change.org petition calling for Apple to recall its defective keyboards. FRIDAY: Images thought to be of Apple\u2019s next iPhone leaked online. source Twitter/OnLeaks\nSteve Hemmerstoffer, aka \u201cOnLeaks,\u201d released schematics on Twitter of what appear to be the new iPhone coming later this year.\nThe schematics line up with previous rumors and reports pointing to Apple releasing an iPhone with a three-lens camera system in 2019. Just another leak seemingly confirming my January #iPhoneXI prototype leak accuracy\u2026 ???? pic.twitter.com/qVWF59GgKr\nApple is big on secrecy and does not like leaks; it famously created a crack team of former National Security Agency and FBI agents working around the clock, year-round, to prevent and investigate product leaks. FRIDAY: News broke that Apple\u2019s lead architect of its custom iOS chips had left the company. source Apple\nApple\u2019s A-series chips are one of the distinguishing factors that set Apple\u2019s mobile devices like iPhones and iPads apart from the competition. They\u2019re unique systems-on-a-chip, or SoCs, which handle the computing, graphics, image processing, motion processing, artificial intelligence, and security of the devices.\nIn other words, they are extremely important.\nGerard Williams III was Apple\u2019s lead designer of these chips, from the A7 chip that powered 2013\u2019s iPhone 5S to the A12X that powers Apple\u2019s latest iPhone XS and XS Max. And on Friday, CNET broke the news that Williams had left the company .\nIt\u2019s unclear what Williams will do next, but Apple\u2019s custom chips play a big role in Apple\u2019s mobile success. Of course, Apple still has an entire team dedicated to this effort, and losing one person doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything in terms of short- or long-term change. But it\u2019s likely to miss Williams in more ways than one. FRIDAY: Apple canceled AirPower, its wireless-charging mat that debuted almost two years ago. caption Apple said its AirPower mat could power up to three devices at once. source Apple\nIn 2016, people were not happy that Apple abandoned the headphone jack in the new iPhone 7.\nIn 2017, Apple wanted to make it clear to everyone that it was serious about a truly wireless future. So it did something at its September event that it doesn\u2019t normally do: It unveiled a product that was still in its concept stages and not close to ready.\nApple said the AirPower wireless-charging mat could recognize your iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods and charge them accordingly and simultaneously.\nApple said AirPower would be released in 2018, but the entire year passed and we heard nothing from Apple. References to AirPower were quietly removed from Apple\u2019s website in September. The only things we heard were a few reports that said Apple was having engineering issues with AirPower\u2019s thermals (as in, the product was overheating).\nAirPower had some signs of life in March. References to AirPower popped up on Apple\u2019s Australian website . Apple released its second-generation AirPods, which showed a picture of the mat on the back of the packaging \u2013 and still does \u2013 suggesting an imminent AirPower announcement.\nBut on Friday, Apple dropped the news to TechCrunch : It was canceling AirPower once and for all, saying it couldn\u2019t live up to Apple\u2019s high bar for quality.\nApple canceling AirPower was, in many ways, unprecedented and embarrassing. Apple had never announced and shown off a product and then canceled it before its public debut.\nOf course, it\u2019s probably for the best that Apple recognized the issue and killed it instead of pouring time and resources into reengineering the mat, which might not have been worth the investment. But it\u2019s not a good look that Apple was fine with unveiling a product that wasn\u2019t close to ready. But of course, the week wasn\u2019t all bad. source Apple\nSome good things that happened to Apple last week: It shipped the third-generation iPad Air and fifth-generation iPad Mini , which both support the Apple Pencil for the first time. It released electrocardiogram functionality for the Apple Watch in Hong Kong and 19 European countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. Apple Pay expanded into six new countries: Austria, Estonia, Greece, Portugal, Slovakia, and Slovenia.\nApple also unveiled its most important announcement of 2019 so far: the Apple Card , its answer to the credit card.

            "text": "Apple Card: Why it may not be the credit card for you\nApple\u2019s new AirPower was a wireless charging pad to help clean up the mess of charging cables for your iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods. Apple unveiled AirPower at its iPhone X Event , but the company didn\u2019t provide much detail. More than a year later, the project was killed.\nUpdated 03/29/19: In a statement to the press, Apple has announced that AirPower is dead. What\u2019s the latest?\nIn a statement to the press Friday, March 29, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering Dan Riccio officially killed the AirPower project. \u201cAfter much effort, we\u2019ve concluded AirPower will not achieve our high standards and we have cancelled the project. We apologize to those customers who were looking forward to this launch. We continue to believe that the future is wireless and are committed to push the wireless experience forward.\u201d So that\u2019s that.\nSee our roundup of the best wireless chargers for iPhone for alternatives to Apple's now-defunct product. AirPower still on the way?\nWill the AirPower actually ship this year? If the recent rumors are to believe, it seems like it could. On December 31, 2018, developer Steve Troughton-Smith tweeted that he had heard that AirPower has been fixed. On January 11, 2019, ChargerLab tweeted that a \u201ccredible source\u201d informed the site that Luxshare Precision (who manufactures Apple\u2019s AirPods and USB-C cables) has started manufacturing the AirPower for Apple. Now there\u2019s a report from DigiTimes saying that the device will become available later in 2019. No other details, such as price or device compatibility, have been revealed.\nBack in October 2018. analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that Apple will release new AirPods in early 2019. The new AirPods will include a new redesigned case that supports wireless charging. That could mean the AIrPower wireless charging mat could be released at the same time\u2014though we should clarify that Kuo does not specifically mention AirPower in his report. What is AirPower?\nAirPower is a wireless charging pad. There are several wireless charging pads on the market, but before the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, you had to use a special case with your iPhone in order to use a wireless charging pad.\nAirPower works without the need of a special case. Just plop your iPhone on to the AirPower pad, and it starts charging. No need to plug in your iPhone. How does the AirPower work?\nPlace the AirPower pad on your desk or wherever you like to charge your devices. Then plug it into a power outlet. To charge your device, just place it on the mat, with front facing up. That\u2019s it.\nTo get a little but more technical, AirPower uses induction , where an electromagnetic field is used to transfer power from (in this case) the AirPower to a device. When you place your device on the AirPower, it receives a signal from the pad to basically \u2018handshake\u201d with the device (checks for compatibility, charge capacity, etc). If everything checks out, charging proceeds. Apple\nApple AirPower Can my iPhone work with AirPower?\nOnly three iPhones work with AirPower: iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X. These iPhones not only have glass backs (as opposed to the aluminum backs of the iPhone 6 and 7), but they also have the hardware support to charge wirelessly. Can my iPad work with AirPower?\nThe current iPads (as of September 2017) are not compatible with AirPower. It seems as though a glass back is required, and a glass back as big as one for the iPad would be expensive, heavy, and perhaps too fragile to use. Can my Apple Watch work with AirPower?\nAirPower works with the Apple Watch Series 3 . Can my AirPods work with AirPower?\nThey can, but you need the new AirPod case that Apple introduced at the iPhone X Event. You can\u2019t use the original case with the AirPower. Nor can you simply place your AirPod earbuds on the AirPower to charge them. You have to place the earbuds in the new case, and then place the case on the AirPower. Or you can charge the case on the AirPower, take the case off the pad, and then put the AirPods in the case to charge them,\nApple has not release details on the new AirPod case. As of this writing, the new case isn\u2019t on the company\u2019s website. Can my MacBook laptop work with AirPower?\nNo. AirPower is designed to work with the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, Apple Watch Series 3, and the new AirPods case. Apple Can my Beats earphones work with AirPower?\nNo. See previous answer. Can my non-Apple Qi-compliant device work with AirPower?\nApple said it was working on the AirPower to be Qi-compliant, and if/when this happens, this could mean compatibility with non-Apple Qi-compliant products. But we don\u2019t have confirmation yet. The iPhone 8 and iPhone X are compatible with the Qi wireless charging standard and can be used with Qi chargers like the Belkin Boost Up ($59.95 on Amazon ) or the Mophie Wireless Base . Can the AirPower fast-charge my iPhone?\nApple has not released specifications on AirPower, which would include the charging rate that the AirPower works at.\nThe Qi specification supports fast charging at 15 watts. The rate at which AirPower works at has not been disclosed. So it remains to be seen if it can support fast charging.\nAccording to a report from MacRumors , iOS 11.2 will change the wireless charging performance from a maximum of 5 watts to 7.5 watts. While that\u2019s not as fast as some other fast chargers, it\u2019s faster than the included iPhone adapter. How much is AirPower?\nApple has not released price information about AirPower. When will AirPower be available?\nApple has only said that AirPower will be available in 2018. See The Latest above for the most recent rumors about a possible ship date, but it might not arrive at all. Where can I buy AirPower?\nYou\u2019ll be able to buy it on the online Apple store, as well as your nearest Apple retail store town square. Also check authorized third parties, such as Best Buy.

            "text": "3 Tech Stocks That Pay Juicier Dividends Than Apple Ashraf Eassa, The Motley Fool Reblog Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) started up its current dividend program back in 2012 after years of refusing to give back even a single cent to its shareholders. Since then, the company has dutifully allocated a meaningful portion of its free cash flow to its dividend program and has raised its dividend payouts per share each year. While Apple is committed to its dividend program, the reality is that Apple isn't the highest-yielding stock out there. As of this writing, the company's dividend yield stands at 1.54%. That's a nontrivial amount, certainly, and the company is sure to raise it when it updates investors on its capital return program next month, but it's far from the most impressive yield that you can find in the world of tech stocks these days. One person hands a dividend check to another. More Image source: Getty Images. To that end, here are three tech stocks that offer more generous dividend yields than Apple does: Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) , and Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) . 1. Broadcom Broadcom is a company that generates a gigantic -- and growing -- amount of free cash flow. The company has historically been focused on semiconductors (also more colloquially referred to as chips), but recently, it has been building up a large and highly profitable infrastructure software business, too, using its acquisitions of Brocade and CA Technologies as the foundation of that business.",

            "title": "Energy Focus, Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2018 Financial Results",
            "text": "SOLON, Ohio, April 01, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Energy Focus, Inc. (NASDAQ:EFOI), a leader in advanced LED lighting technologies, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The Company also announced that, following a process to evaluate its strategic options, it has completed a strategic financing, which includes changes to its Board of Directors. It has also implemented cost reduction actions, and the executive management team is resigning in connection with these actions and their completion of the strategic process.\nFourth Quarter 2018 Financial Results:\nNet sales were $3.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. This compares with $5.2 million in the third quarter, and $4.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net sales from commercial products were $1.2 million, down from $2.3 million in the third quarter and $3.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The declines were due to unexpected budgetary delays, push outs in retrofit project starts and losses to lower priced competitors. Net sales from military and maritime products were $1.9 million, down from $2.9 million in the third quarter and up from $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The sequential decrease was primarily due to the cyclical timing of government purchases, which are generally lowest in the fourth quarter.\nGross profit was $19 thousand, or 0.6% of net sales, for the fourth quarter, including excess and obsolete, and related reserves of $0.5 million that impacted gross profit by 17.6 percentage points. This compares with gross profit of $1.3 million, or 25% of net sales in the third quarter, and $1.6 million, or 34%, of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOperating loss was ($3.0) million for the fourth quarter. This compares with an operating loss of ($1.9) million in the third quarter and ($1.9) million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet loss was also ($3.0) million for the fourth quarter, compared with ($1.9) million in the third quarter and ($1.9) million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net loss per share was ($0.25), compared with ($0.16) in the third quarter and ($0.16) in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA, as defined under \u201cNon-GAAP Measures\u201d below, was a loss of ($2.5) million, compared with ($1.2) million in the third quarter and ($1.3) million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCash and cash equivalents were $6.3 million as of December 31, 2018, which included $2.2 million in borrowings under our $5.0 million credit facility. This compares with $7.1 million, with no debt at the end of the third quarter of 2018.\nFiscal Year 2018 Highlights:\nRevenues of $18.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with $19.8 million in 2017.\nIntroduced six new product families to expand and diversify the portfolio, including our commercial fixtures, double-ended T8 and T5 high output TLEDs, Invisitube ultra-low EMI TLEDs, Navy high-bay retrofit kit and dimmable industrial downlights. New product revenue, including our RedCap\u2122 emergency battery backup tube, grew from less than 1% of total revenue in Q4 2017 to 17% of revenue in Q4 2018, its highest level in two years. Revenue from our military luminaire and fixture product line grew by over 90% from 2017 to 2018. Strategic Financing\nOn March 29, 2019, the Company closed a strategic financing from a group of investors (including certain investors that had filed a Schedule 13D with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 30, 2018). The financing provided gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $1.7 million in exchange for subordinated convertible promissory notes that will convert into shares of the Company\u2019s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock on either April 17, 2019 or the day following the Company\u2019s annual meeting of stockholders, if stockholder approval is needed to allow full conversion of the notes under the Nasdaq market rules. In connection with the financing, the Board of Directors has appointed James Tu and Robert Farkas to join the Board, effective following the Company\u2019s filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K. Mr. Tu will also return to the position of Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President and serve as its interim Chief Financial Officer effective April 2, 2019 and the Company is conducting a search for a permanent or alternative interim Chief Financial Officer candidate.\nMr. Tu was one of the parties that participated in the Schedule 13D filing and financing and served as the Company\u2019s Executive Chairman of the Board, non-Executive Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President from 2013 through 2017. Mr. Farkas has served in key financial and operations management roles in emerging companies and has experience in lighting controls, communications, biotech, electrical and software industries. Mr. Farkas most recently offered a variety of consulting services at Crestview Associates, LLC, and his other past roles include serving as Vice President, Finance & Operations of The Watt Stopper, Inc., which develops and supplies lighting control products and Operations Controller of Legrand North America, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NetExpress, Inc., and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of North Star Computers, Inc. Mr. Farkas currently serves on the board of directors of Finis Inc. and Convo Communications. He is also the chair of the Menlo College\u2019s Finance Advisory Board.\nStrategic Alternatives Review\nPrior to, and in parallel with, the discussions with the investor group, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors retained Craig-Hallum Capital Group to act as its financial advisor to assist in conducting a thorough process to evaluate its strategic alternatives aimed at maximizing shareholder value, including the possible sale of some or all of the Company. In connection with this process, the Board of Directors determined that the strategic financing was the most favorable option for the Company and its stockholders at this time.\nIn connection with the completion of this strategic process, the Company\u2019s Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President, Ted Tewksbury, and Jerry Turin, the Company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer since May 2018, resigned from all positions, in each case, effective following the Company\u2019s filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K. Also, in connection with the completion of this process, and under the terms of the financing, current Board members, Ron Black, Marc Eisenberg and Satish Rishi resigned at the same time.\nCost Reduction Actions\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company implemented phased actions to reduce costs in order to minimize cash usage while continuing to pursue strategic alternatives as described above. Reductions have been limited to an initial phase in order to not diminish from the potential value of divestitures under the strategic review, or conflict with potential strategies subsequent to the financing.\nThe Company\u2019s initial actions included the elimination of 12 positions, restructuring of the sales organization and incentive plan, flattening of the senior management team, additional operational streamlining, management compensation reductions, and outsourcing of certain functions including warehousing and marketing. When fully realized, these reductions will reduce expenses by approximately $1.6 million per year. In connection with these actions, the Company expects to incur one-time cash costs of approximately $0.1 million, including anticipated employee severance in the first and second quarters of 2019, in addition to approximately $0.5 million in non-cash charges in the fourth quarter of 2018 for excess and obsolete, and related inventory reserves triggered by the decline in market conditions referred to above.\nEarnings Conference Call Postponed:\nAs a result of the transition in the Company\u2019s leadership discussed above, the conference call and webcast originally scheduled for April 2, 2019 at 9:00 a.m. EDT has been cancelled. The Company will host a conference call following the release of its first quarter 2019 results to discuss the current events and recent financial results. A news release announcing the participation details will be issued prior to the call date.\nForward Looking Statements:\nForward-looking statements in this release are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These are supplemental measures of performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, include adjustments for our restructuring expenses, and for depreciation and stock compensation expenses that do not have a current period impact on cash flow.\nWe believe that our use of non-GAAP financial measures permits investors to assess the operating performance of our business relative to our performance based on U.S. GAAP results and relative to other companies within the industry by isolating the effects of items that may vary from period to period without correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies, and to assess cash flow performance of the operations of our business relative to our U.S. GAAP results and relative to other companies in the industry by isolating the effects of certain items which do not have a current period cash flow impact. However, our inclusion of these adjusted measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items or that the items for which we have made adjustments are unusual or infrequent or will not recur. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors as they form part of the basis for how our management team and Board of Directors evaluate our operating performance.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace U.S. GAAP financial measures, and they are not necessarily standardized or comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nThree months ended Twelve months ended December 31, September 30, December 31, December 31, 2018 2018 2017 2018 2017 Total operating expenses $ 2,992 $ 3,182 $ 3,500 $ 12,497 $ 16,102 Less: Impairment loss \u2014 \u2014 (185 ) \u2014 (185 ) Less: Restructuring (157 ) (1 ) (128 ) (111 ) (1,662 ) Operating expenses, excluding impairment and restructuring charges $ 2,835 $ 3,181 $ 3,187 $ 12,386 $ 14,255 Three months ended Twelve months ended December 31, September 30, December 31, December 31, 2018 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net loss $ (2,997 ) $ (1,920 ) $ (1,858 ) $ (9,111 ) $ (11,267 ) Impairment loss \u2014 \u2014 (185 ) \u2014 (185 ) Restructuring expenses (157 ) (1 ) (128 ) (111 ) (1,662 ) Net loss, excluding impairment and restructuring charges (2,840 ) (1,919 ) (1,545 ) (9,000 ) (9,420 ) Depreciation 123 105 167 522 681 Stock-based compensation 202 276 182 908 807 Severance and benefits 10 313 51 335 143 Adjusted EBITDA $ (2,481 ) $ (1,223 ) $ (1,259 ) $ (7,207 ) $ (7,902 )",

            "text": "Thesis: Apple ( AAPL ) is at a price point, which I believe offers attractive return potential to investors on cost. While Apple has seen iPhone sales decline significantly in 1Q19 from 1Q18, I believe growth in its other segments (Mac, iPad, etc.) as well as the proprietary nature of those products will stabilize the iPhone sales decline and result in FY19 revenue growth. Growth in the smartphone market has also crushed forecasts and is still poised for strong growth moving forward; a macro trend that plays well for Apple, considering it controls approximately 24% of the global smartphone market share. With that being said, I recommend Apple shares at current prices and anticipate them to return approximately 8% with dividends to shareholders by the end of FY19 on cost.\n( Image Source )\nApple\u2019s Strong Product Segment Growth And What It Can Do For iPhone Sales: Other than iPhones, Apple grew all of its other segments in 1Q19 from 1Q18. It saw approximately 8.7% growth in Mac sales, 16.9% growth in iPad sales, 33.3% growth in Wearables, Home, and Accessories sales, and 19.1% growth in Services sales. All the while, iPhone sales fell 15%, resulting in a net sales loss of approximately 4.5%. While seeing Apple\u2019s trademark product lose 15% in net sales from the same time a year ago is intimidating, I believe Apple\u2019s proprietary product line will stabilize iPhone sales moving forward. What I mean by stabilize is, I believe iPhone sales will be equal to or greater than (15%) in the remaining three quarters of FY19 in comparison to the respective quarter in FY18. Apple\u2019s products are extraordinarily integrated with one another. As Apple\u2019s other segments grow, I anticipate the proprietary nature of Apple\u2019s products will stimulate iPhone sales, as it\u2019s essentially necessary for compatibility purposes.\n( Image and Information Source - Page 1 )\nGlobal Smartphone Market Growth Crushes Forecasts And Breeds iPhone Sales Growth Hopes: Global smartphone market growth crushed Statista forecasts. The most recent data from data pegged 1.86 billion active smartphones at the end of 2015, with forecasts for that number to reach 2.53 billion by the end of 2018. However, a report by Newzoo found that there were roughly 3.3 billion active smartphones globally by June of 2018. With approximately 3.3 billion smartphones by the end of FY18, actual growth outperformed forecasts by 30.43% and grew at a CAGR of 21% from FY15\u2019s figure of 1.86 billion. Newzoo is forecasting 3.8 billion global smartphone users by 2021, which would represent a CAGR of 7.4% from FY19 to FY20.\n( Image Source )\nApple currently controls 24% of the global smartphone market share with 800.7 million active devices as of June of 2018. Should Apple maintain a market share close to 24%, it should be able to realize approximately 1.78% CAGR growth in iPhone sales over the next couple years from global smartphone growth. I get that figure by taking Apple\u2019s market share portion of the global smartphone user growth rate of 7.4%.\n( Image Source )\nSeeing strong growth in global smartphone users is beneficial for all players in the smartphone industry. The figures above show the amount of growth potential that still exists in the global smartphone market, and I believe Apple will find a way to take its share. In all, based on the data above, we can expect Apple to see iPhone sales naturally grow by approximately 1.78% over the next couple years so long as global smartphone market forecasts are met.\nI personally don\u2019t anticipate Apple seeing many more quarters of iPhone sales decline, at least at the level that we saw in 1Q19. Apple is set to release 2Q19 earnings on 05/07/2019, which is going to provide valuable data to interpret. However, in the meantime, I am going to run my quantitative analysis on the contingency that Apple loses 15% of iPhone sales in each of the remaining FY19 quarters in respect to the same quarter a year ago. I would like to note that should Apple produce iPhone sales > (15%), identical sales, or iPhone sales growth in any of the remaining FY19 quarters from the same respective quarter in FY18, the value of the opportunity I\u2019m addressing in this article gains more depth.\nQuantitative Analysis: Apple\u2019s 1Q19 revenue was $84,310 million, with 61.65% of that coming from iPhone sales, and 38.35% of it coming from its other segments. I would like to note that iPhone sales accounted for approximately 69% of Apple\u2019s revenue in 1Q18. While iPhone sales declined 15%, I do anticipate them to grow at a rate of 1.78% derived from global smartphone market growth of 7.4% in relativity to Apple\u2019s global smartphone market share of 24%. I forecasted Apple's 2Q19-4Q19 iPhone sales figures by cutting the previous years' quarter by 15% then multiplying the sum by the growth rate of 1.78%. This method of forecasting anticipates and accounts for 15% losses in iPhone sales in 2Q19-4Q19, accompanied by a modest growth rate of 1.78%. Using the data above gives us 2Q19 iPhone sales of $38,362 million, 3Q19 iPhone sales of $35,399 million, and 4Q19 iPhone sales of $41,803 million.\nApple\u2019s other segment revenue (Mac, iPad, Wearables, Home, and Accessories, and Services) accounts for 38.35% of its revenue. Combined, other segment revenue came to $27,189 million in 1Q18. In 1Q19, other segment revenue came to $32,328 million combined, representing YoY growth of 18.9%. I anticipate that Apple will see slightly lower YoY quarterly segment growth of 15% in 2Q19\u20134Q19. I forecasted other segment revenue using a nearly identical method as I did forecasting iPhone revenue for FY19. I take 38.35% of previous years\u2019 respective quarterly revenue, as that\u2019s the percentage that accounts for Apple\u2019s other segments. I then multiply each quarter\u2019s revenue figure by the growth rate, in this case 15%, to get our forecasted segment revenue for 2Q19\u20134Q19. This gives us 2Q19 other segment revenue of $26,963 million, 3Q19 other segment revenue of $23,491 million, and 4Q19 other segment revenue of $27,740 million.\n( Image Source )\nNOTE: The graphic above is a visual representation of why I am forecasting Apple\u2019s 2Q19\u20134Q19 revenues using the same quarter from a year ago versus the most recent quarter. A consistent quarterly sales pattern develops in 1Q12 and carries on to the end of the graph. Apple obviously sees extraordinary first quarter results as a result of the holiday season, thus, we can\u2019t use 1Q data to predict 2Q and vice versa.\nCombining our 2Q19\u20134Q19 iPhone revenue forecasts and other segment revenue forecasts gives us a forecasted FY19 total revenue figure of $278,068 million, representing 4.7% growth from FY18. Apple has a five-year average net margin of 22%, which I believe will be maintained. With a 22% net margin, we get a forecasted FY19 net income figure of $61,175 million, which translates to forecasted FY19 EPS of $12.95. Apple has traded at a five-year average P/E ratio of 15.7, which is a reasonable earnings multiple for Apple. With our forecasted FY19 EPS of $12.95 and an earnings multiple of 15.7, we get a FY19 price target of $203.32, representing upside potential of 7.95% on current cost. Apple also provides a 1.55% dividend yield on cost, which would translate to a return of 9.5% on cost if held for at least a year.\nThe Opportunity at Hand: The opportunity at hand is brought to fruition by Apple\u2019s ability to grow its other segments at impressive rates, and its ability to produce earnings growth in the same quarter that iPhone sales - 61.65% of Apple\u2019s revenue stream - dropped 15%. In my quantitative analysis, I outline how Apple can grow FY19 year-end revenue by approximately 4.7% from FY18. With upside potential of as much as 9.5% amidst struggling iPhone sales, a valuable opportunity exists within Apple under the contingency that it can stimulate iPhone sales before the end of FY19. Even with iPhone sales dropping 15% with each preceding quarter of FY19 on a YoY basis, I still forecast solid revenue and earnings growth. With that being said, Apple\u2019s 2Q19 earnings report will provide strong insight into how iPhone sales are currently faring. If Apple can post strong 2Q19 iPhone sales, I strongly believe its stock and shareholders will be duly rewarded.\nAssociated Risks: While I feel confident in Apple\u2019s competitive edge and ability to thrive in both the short and long term, there are certainly some risks to keep in mind. In Apple\u2019s case, I currently only find one big concern, and I think it\u2019s obvious - market share loss.\nI have worries that Apple may be overly focused on catering to the high-end cell phone market. All of Apple\u2019s devices are top-end. However, its quality comes with a price tag that many can\u2019t afford, especially in developing markets, which is where Apple is losing ground to the likes of Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ). In fact, Samsung has passed Apple as the leader in the global smartphone market, controlling 27% compared to Apple\u2019s 24%. It\u2019s also not good seeing Samsung passing Apple due what appears to be market share absorption, as Apple lost users while Samsung gained them.\nChina also has some other big players in the global smartphone market that are proving to hurt Apple. Oppo, Xiaomi, Huawei, and Vivo are the world\u2019s 3 rd , 4 th , 5 th , and 6 th largest global smartphone providers respectively, and control 33% of the global market combined. These companies are making impressive smartphone devices with starting prices of less than half of that of Apple\u2019s cheapest model of the new iPhone. The graphic below shows the margin gap between Apple and Samsung. However, margins can only make up for so much of a lack of sales. Apple saw iPhone sales in the Greater China region drop 27% in 1Q19 from 1Q18. If Apple doesn\u2019t find a way to cater to lower-end markets, I\u2019m concerned its global smartphone market share may be in serious danger.\nWith iPhones consisting of 61.65% of Apple\u2019s revenue stream, it can take many more sales loss hits without putting Apple\u2019s stock in jeopardy. If iPhone sales plummet, Apple could see quite large market price drops. Due to the weight that Apple investors put on iPhone sales, and considering they\u2019ve been rocky, I believe an investment in Apple could drop as much as 25% in market value should iPhone sales remain turbulent. While Apple is not a volatile company, it has seen price drops of that significance in the past. Most recently, it dropped from roughly $225 per share in October of 2018 to around $148 per share by January of 2019, roughly a 35% drop in market price in under a quarter.\nWith that being said, I believe in Apple\u2019s ability to recapture global smartphone market share and compete at a superior level to its peers. However, market share is something worth monitoring without bias, as even Apple could face serious trouble should it start losing too much market share.\nConclusion: In conclusion, I believe Apple\u2019s other segment growth will help stabilize and potentially stimulate iPhone sales. I believe this has a likely chance of occurring due to the proprietary nature of Apple\u2019s product line. In turn, global smartphone users are still exhibiting strong growth, providing an opportunity for Apple to regain and continue to grow its market share. Apple has fared well recently with all things considered. Even with slumping iPhone sales, my analysis still paints Apple as undervalued. If Apple produces strong iPhone sales moving forward in FY19, they will reap the benefits. In fact, if Apple posts identical iPhone sales in 2Q19, I could see its stock arriving at a $225 price target before the end of FY19, representing upside of nearly 20%. If Apple posts results similar to what they produced in 1Q19, I forecast they will reach my other price target of $203.32, representing 7.95% upside before dividends, and a 9.5% upside after dividends on current cost. With that being said, I recommend shares of Apple at current prices with an expected return of at least 8% by the end of FY19.\nDisclosure: I am/we are long AAPL. ",

            "text": "Facebook Why did Apple kill its AirPower wireless charger? After Apple cancelled plans to launch its AirPower wireless charger more than a year and a half after announcing it, at least one analyst said the company's explanation sounds fishy Credit: Dreamstime Comments\nMore than a year and a half after announcing it would release a wireless charger capable of concurrently powering up an iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods, Apple has thrown up its hands in defeat.\nIn a statement released Friday, Apple's senior vice president of hardware engineering, Dan Riccio, said the company had concluded that its AirPower wireless charger \"would not achieve our high standards,\" so it cancelled the project.\n\"We apologise to those customers who were looking forward to this launch. We continue to believe that the future is wireless and are committed to push the wireless experience forward,\" Riccio wrote.\nApple did not address Computerworld inquiries about what technical issues crippled AirPower or if the company plans to take a different tack to develop a wireless charger.\nApple's explanation of why it canceled AirPower sounded \"fishy\" to Jack Gold, principal analyst with J. Gold Associates.\n\"Does that mean their engineering staff couldn't design a product that met the needs? I know they are stringent in their designs, but given they have complete control (unless they outsourced it all), and they've had plenty of time to make it work, my guess is they just gave up because they were so late to market and there are already a ton of competing products out there,\" Gold said via email.\nA market saturated with competing projects could have precluded Apple from charging its normal premium product price and so it may not have been worthwhile from a profitability standpoint, Gold said.\nApple originally announced AirPower in September 2017, saying it would ship the multi-device wireless charger by the end of 2018. But as 2018 came and went, AirPower was a no-show .\nEach time Apple announced it would showcase new products, industry pundits speculated one of them would be AirPower. In January, Hong Kong-based website ChargerLAB tweeted that a \"credible source\" in the supply chain had confirmed that AirPower was already in production. A multi-device wireless charger from Holland-based Zens. Its Dual+Watch Fast Wireless Charger can charge two smartphones and an Apple Watch at the same time\nOver the past six or so months, all references to AirPower on Apple's web pages vanished.\nSome industry analysts and pundits speculated the problem developing AirPower had to do with the need to overlap copper charging coils in order to modulate the power output to meet the needs of three Apple devices with different charging requirements.\nAlong with being able to automatically adjust power output depending on the device on the charging pad, the closer the charger's copper coils and the greater number of them there are, the more potential there is for overheating.\n\"The challenge was not charging three different devices but rather put three different devices wherever you wanted on the mat and have them charge,\" said Carolina Milanesi, a principal analyst at Creative Strategies. \"Many people were skeptical about the feasibility of this due to the need of the coils to somewhat overlap.\n\"While it us up to Apple to make the product meet their standards, they have faced challenges that I suppose they could not solve and still ship a product that they felt meet user's needs,\" Milanesi continued. \"For instance, they could have found a way to avoid overheating but had to sacrifice the speed at which the products charged.\"\nBroadly speaking, there are three types of wireless charging .\nThere are charging pads that use tightly coupled electromagnetic inductive or non-radiative charging; charging bowls or through-surface type chargers that use loosely coupled or radiative electromagnetic resonant charging that can transmit a charge a few centimetres; and uncoupled radio frequency (RF) wireless charging that allows a trickle charging capability at distances of many feet.\nBoth tightly coupled inductive and loosely coupled resonant charging operate on the same principle of physics: a time-varying magnetic field induces a current in a closed loop of copper wire.\nIn October 2017, Apple purchased New Zealand-based PowerByProxi , which had developed a loosely coupled radiative resonant charging bowl. No further announcements about PowerByProxi were made by Apple after the acquisition.\nSince announcing AirPower in 2017, more than a dozen competing multi-device wireless chargers have shipped \u2014 though none purports to be capable of charging three different Apple devices at the same time. The chargers that can power up more than one device simultaneously do so with an iPhone and Apple Watch. Belkin BOOST\u2191UP Wireless Charging Dock\nIn fact, upon launching its first wireless charging-capable phones , the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, Apple recommended that users purchase wireless charging pads from third-party suppliers Mophie and Belkin.\nWhile Apple's silence over the past year and a half as to the fate of its AirPower wireless charger may have disappointed some anticipating it, Milanesi said it would have been irresponsible to ship a product that wasn't fully baked.\n\"It is certainly not Apple M.O. to promise devices and then not ship them; history shows that,\" Milanesi said. \"Apple was late to wireless charging so they might have wanted to deliver something that was different and more user-friendly, as they often do. In this case, I guess the laws of physics got in the way.\"",

I am regretful to announce that at the last minute we've hit a snag filings our financials. Nothing major, but we've had our accounting firm ask for some tax related work that they've never asked for before at the 11 th and 99, 100 th hour. So we are filing a press release right now that says we will release the earnings on Thursday.\nWe do not anticipate any problems getting this work cleared by then, but we will then release the earnings after the market on Thursday and do our earnings call then. But I do wanted to come on the call because we found out about it at such a late hour that I knew that people were going to be on the call. So I leave an open invitation if anyone wants to followup with the investor relations line if they have questions.\nAgain there are no disagreements, just some extra work that they've asked us for that we anticipate clearing up in the next 24 hours or so, we've left us till Thursday just to be, to air on the side of infinite caution we don\u2019t imagine we'll have any snags reporting by then. But then again we didn\u2019t imagine we'd have any snags reporting today. But that is the schedule.\nI apologize for taking your time today and I look forward to speaking with you on Thursday and hopefully you guys can all make that and potentially even some more. So I look forward to speaking to you then and having our earnings public and again I'm sorry for this last minute change of plans, but thank you for being on the call.\nSo operator, with that, we're going to close up today's call.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.\nQ -",

            "text": "Stock Market Today: Apple Kills AirPower, Cuts Prices in China Jim Crumly, The Motley Fool Reblog Stocks got off to a strong start in the second quarter, moving higher on news that manufacturing activity in China rose in March. Domestic economic data were more mixed, with U.S. manufacturing activity accelerating but retail sales falling 0.2% in February. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) both gained more than 1%. Today's stock market 32.79 Data source: Yahoo! Finance. As for individual stocks, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) gave up on the AirPower charging mat and lowered prices in China, and Kellogg (NYSE: K) is divesting sweet snack product lines. Rising stock graphs on colorful background. More Image source: Getty Images. Apple axes AirPower, cuts prices in China Apple investors got a mixed bag of news today, with the company canceling the AirPower charging mat and reducing prices in China. Shares crept up 0.7%. The cancellation of AirPower amounts to an embarrassment for Apple, but probably won't have much of an impact on financial results. The company announced AirPower in September 2017 as part of the iPhone X unveiling and said it would be available in 2018. Apparently the product development hit some technical snags, so iPhone users will continue to rely on third-party devices for wireless charging. More important to the company's future results was a price cut to iPhone products in China, as reported by CNBC . The price of the entry-level iPhone X model, the XR, was lowered 4.6%, and the price tags on the XS and XS Max were cut 5.7% and 5.2%, respectively. A shortfall in China sales took Apple by surprise and caused a rare downward revision in guidance in January. This week's price action may help revive the iPhone business there, and a cut in China's value-added tax from 16% to 13%, which went into effect today, should ease the profit impact on Apple. Kellogg cuts back on sweets Kellogg is getting out of the cookie business, announcing today that it is selling those brands, along with fruit-flavored snacks, pie crust, and ice cream cone product lines to Italian confection company Ferrero Group for $1.3 billion. Kellogg shares fell 2.4%. The divestiture includes cookie brands such as Keebler, Mother's, Famous Amos, and cookies the company makes for Girl Scouts. Ferrero Group makes chocolates, Nutella, and Tic Tac breath mints. Kellogg had already announced it was looking for a buyer for those businesses as it tries to reshape its portfolio by investing in new brands in areas such as digestive health and natural foods and reviving existing brands. The affected products accounted for net sales of almost $900 million in 2018 out of total sales of $13.5 billion. The U.S. snack segment of the company suffered a sales decline of nearly 5% last year, and Kellogg thinks divesting parts of that business will help it deliver organic growth of 1% to 2% in 2019, up from a flat performance last year.

BRUTAL BRAWLING\nSuddenly, two men at a nearby table decide to involve themselves and start arguing with the group.\nOne of the thugs then marches up to their table and starts slapping and punching a man wearing a hooded top.\nHe knees the man in the face as he desperately tries to defend himself and the woman sat next to him also gets embroiled in the melee.\nDuring the assault, the attacker and his friend are covered in sauce and the violence is paused so they can wipe themselves down - allowing the victim to flee for cover.\nDoes not matter what happened, absolutely no need for it. Shazad Bukhari, Social Media User\nMoments later he returns and launches himself at the attacker but is easily overpowered and the thug throws him into a table and starts pummelling him.\nThe attacker's friend then joins in and starts kicking and punching the man on the ground.\nDiners and staff finally intervene to stop the beating and the victim is led away to safety.\nViewers on social media were appalled by the violence.\nSuhaila Sulaiman Nadeem commented: \"Scum needs to be put behind bars.\"\nShazad Bukhari wrote: \"Does not matter what happened, absolutely no need for it.

A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in today's news release on our website.\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Mark Duff. Please go ahead, Mark.\nMark Duff\nGreat, thanks David. We had a couple of minor setbacks in the fourth quarter that resulted in isolating impacts on our financial performance. First, there was an unplanned outage of approximately 2 weeks at our Perma-Fix Northwest facility, which has been resolved. Second, we incurred a continued delay and expenses associated with the plant closure of our M&EC facility.\nDespite these challenges which I'll discuss more in a moment, I'm pleased to report that our Treatment segment revenue increased and we entered 2019 with a strong backlog in sales pipeline. On top of this, we have recently been awarded several new projects in early March by approximately $17 million of our 2019 with significant potential growth in future years as well.\nThese latest contracts significantly increased our funded backlog and will bolster our beginning in the second quarter of 2019. These wins which will be formally signed and announced in the coming weeks include remediation work in Canada as well as several DOE or Department of Energy locations throughout the United States. We believe these awards are a direct result of the improvements we've made over the last year within our business development organization.\nSuffice to say, we've been very busy in the procurement processes even though with now as really apparent to our press releases given the limitation placed on us by some of our customers regarding this closure. Also we've completed testing and demonstration of the GeoMelt Vitrification unit at our Perma-Fix Northwest facility in the fourth quarter of 2018, where we formally commenced commercial operations of GeoMelt unit through a partnership with the Veolia Nuclear Solutions and have completed our six treatment events for sodium residual waste.\nThis new capacity allows us to address a large inventory of radioactive waste currently in storage and provides us a substantial multi-year backlog from a new incremental waste stream. It also reflects our successes and diversifying our revenue streams. Also within the Treatment segment, construction activities are continuing at our Perma-Fix floor facility to accept and treat radioactively contaminated water and also an additional commercial waste streams.\nWe've begun to receive order treatment backlog inventories in Florida and should be fully operational this summer, after a few delays that we had in the construction permitting processes. We're continuing our expansion of the hazardous waste processing markets as well in Florida primarily targeting geographically focused opportunities in the Southeast U.S. markets in order to maximize utilization and throughput of our facilities. The terms of the unplanned outage at Perma-Fix Northwest facility in early December, the shutdown last at approximately 2 weeks and the total impact was approximately $800,000.\nDuring this time, waste receipts were halted and production activities remained idle while crews addressed some operational controls associated with processing specific low level waste stream. Since this period in December, Perma-Fix Northwest has realized strong momentum through Q1 and adjustments implement during the outage have proven to be effective and ensuring the highest level of safety for our workers while maintaining efficient operations.\nRegarding the planned closure of the M&EC facility, clearly this has been a larger challenge and anticipated and has resulted in a negative impact to our performance overall for several years. This is due to the costs associated with closure cleanup activities as well as the distractions to our workers and our management team to complete determination of the permits.\nI'm pleased to report we have completed the cleanup phase associated with decontamination to support releasing of the building under the commitments of the closure plan. We're approximately 80% complete in the final verification process and surveys that are required and working directly with the landlord industry in Tennessee for release of the permits in Q2.\nAnd one final note, we are encouraged by the correct direction of the Department of Energy as it relates to the procurement process within the DOE's Office of Environmental Management. The Department has adopted a new End State approach to cleanup, which provides a great emphasis on acceleration of project schedules to include waste management metrics such as waste disposition.\nThis change in procurement strategy is directly align with our offering, which reduces the long-term carrying costs associated with the nation's nuclear waste legacy by accelerating commercialization of waste processing and treatment. In fact, a new approach favors advanced cost effective technologies such as our routing process demonstrated for the test-bed initiative at Hanford as well as the large component dismantlement capabilities. We bring to support faster and more efficient off-site processing.\nTo wrap up, we entered 2019 with treatment backlog of approximately 11.1 million, which bodes well for the rest of the year. We significantly increased our funded backlog for new contracts in the Services segment with over $17 million in new contracts awarded in March alone, and we're actively bidding a number of additional larger projects even within our Services segment and look forward to providing further updates as those proposal developments unfold.\nOn that note, I'll turn it over the call to Ben Naccarato, who will discuss the financial results in more detail. Ben?\nBen Naccarato\nThank you, Mark. Beginning with revenue, our total revenue from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was 11.7 million, compared to last year fourth quarter of 12.6, a decrease of 851,000 or 6.8%. Our Treatment segment revenue increased by 333,000 in the quarter compared to prior due to increases in both received and production volume at our plant. The Services segment was lower than prior year by 1.2 million due to lower project revenue, which is timing related and was impacted by the completion of certain phases of one of our ongoing contracts.\nFor the year ended 2018, revenue was 49.5 million compared 49.8 million in 2017. Our Services segment increased -- revenue increased by 1.2 million as we performed more scope with one of our ongoing customers compared to prior year. Our Treatment segment revenue was lower by 1.5 due to lower processing and disposal revenue compared to prior year. The offset of this drop in revenue though at the Treatment segment was a sharp increase in our opening waste backlog to 11.1 million compared to 7.7 at the end of '17.\nTurning to our cost of sales, our total cost of sales was 10.5 million in the fourth quarter compared to 10.8 in the prior year, a decrease of 322,000 or 3%. Our Treatment segment costs increased by 443,000 compared to prior year, included in this increase was cost of sales of a million dollars, closure reserve booked at the M&EC facility compared to a smaller increase of 850 in Q4. Cost of sales from our Services segment, were down 755,000 consistent with the drop in project revenue.\nGross profit for the quarter was 1.3 million compared to 1.8 million in 2017. Lower revenue at our Services segment and the additional costs related to M&EC in the Treatment segment were the main reason for this drop. For the year ended '18, gross profit was 8.5 million compared to 8.6 million in '17. We had a modest improvement in our margin from revenue mix but that was offset by the impact of the lower volume and lower fixed costs were offset by the higher M&EC costs.\nOur G&A costs for the quarter were 2.7 million compared to 2.8 million last year. The decrease of about 84,000 and lower bad debt was offset by higher marketing and payroll costs. For the year ended 2018, our G&A costs were 10.7 million compared to 11.1 million in the prior year and as with the quarter lower bad debt was offset by higher marketing payroll costs.\nOur research and development expenses were higher than prior year by 396, reflecting the write-down of certain assets in our Medical segment. Our loss from continuing operations, net of taxes for the quarter was 2.4 million compared to 340,000 last year, included in this loss was a million dollars of additional closure reserve booked at M&EC that continuing operating expense at M&EC of 308,000 and the write-off of certain assets at our Medical segment 455,000.\nThe net loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31 was 1.1 million compared to net loss of 3.5 million in the prior year. Excluding all the income and expenses related to M&EC and the write-down of the Medical segment, net income would have improved by 2.6 million.\nNet loss attributable to common shareholders for the quarter was 2.4 million, compared to last year's net income of 2.6. For the year ended December 31, net loss attributable to common shareholders was 1.4 million, compared to 3.7 million in the prior year. Our total loss per share for the quarter was $0.20, compared to income per share of $0.02 in the prior year, and our loss per share for the year ended 12/31/18 was $0.12 compared to $0.31 in the prior year.\nOur adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the quarter as defined in this morning press release was a negative 167, compared 329,000 last year. For the year ended for August '18, adjusted EBITDA was 2 million, compared to 2.4 million in 2017.\nTuring to the balance sheet. In comparison to our year-end of '17, our cash balance dropped by 253,000, our current unbilled receivables were down by 1.4 million, reflecting improved billing and the completion of most of the outstanding M&EC invoicing. Other current assets were down 673,000 due to the reduction of prepaid at M&EC and the write-down of an asset at the Medical segment.\nIntangibles and other assets were down 333,000 due to the elimination of M&EC's long-term unbilled receivables and the write-down of prepaid assets in our Medical segment. Our current liabilities were up 1.9 million, primarily due to increased accounts payable related to the M&EC closure. Our waste backlog sits at 11.1 million compared to 7.7 million at year-end '17.\nOur long-term liabilities was down 1.7 million as a result of the elimination of our preferred share dividends payable at M&EC in the second quarter, and the decrease in our deferred tax liability which netted down against our indefinite live deferred tax assets or tax net operating loss carry forwards generated in 2017. Our current debt including capital leases and excluding debt issuance costs was 1.4 million with 1.2 million due to our primary lender PNC Bank.\nTotal debt as year-end was 3.8 million including capital leases and excluding debt issuance cost was 3.4 million due to our primary lender PNC Bank. Our current working capital was a negative 6.7 million compared to a negative 2.3 million in '17. A couple of things should be noted, however, 5 million of cash collateral which we expect to receive upon closure of the M&EC facility is still listed as long-term asset, and when received, we will use this to reduce the working capital debt. In addition, we have just closed on a $2.5 million of sub-debt with favorable terms that will further improve our liquidity position.\nNext I'll summarize our cash flow for 2018. Cash provided by continuing operations at continuing operating activities was 2.6 million. Our cash used by discontinued ops was 618,000. Our cash used by investing activities was 1.4 million, primarily on cash spending, proceeds for the sale of discontinued ops property was 67,000, cash used for financing was 580,000 consisting of 1.2 million payment on our term-loan, and 639,000 received from the revolver.\nWith that, I'll now turn over the call for questions.\nOperator\nThank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Bill Nasgovitz from Heartland Advisors. Please proceed with your question.\nBill Nasgovitz\nBen, did I get this right? For the quarter there was a $2.6 million improvement, was that?\nBen Naccarato\nNot improvement, Bill. What I was trying to for the year, when you calculate all of the closure expenses and ongoing costs at M&EC and net out some of the positives from the tax credits and the dividends. Without M&DC, we would have had an improvement of $2.6 million.\nBill Nasgovitz\nAnd in terms of this outage for two weeks, what specifically was the problem? And what is the cost in terms of revenues?\nMark Duff\nWell, Bill, the overall revenue impact was about $800,000 with the shutdown and our facility with the backlog had time for the fourth quarter was about $400,000 a week. We had to make some adjustments in our processes out there to make sure that we had given the types of wastes that we were processing, making sure that we contain the contamination properly. And it took about two weeks to make the adjustments we needed to make and make sure that everyone's working safely. It's largely a product of result of get a waste stream and to make sure that the right precautions being taken -- the procedures are correct and then no one gets contaminated.\nBill Nasgovitz\nSo our treatment backlog is $11.1 million as of the end of the year. Is that right?\nMark Duff\nCorrect. Going into the New Year, correct.\nBill Nasgovitz\nAnd then funded backlog, you refer to $17 million of new contracts, but what roughly -- what is the funded backlog?\nMark Duff\nBen, do you have the factual funded backlog, Ben?\nBen Naccarato\nThe actual, no, I don't have it with me, but it's probably -- we were sitting at about 7 to 4 the winds. So, it would probably be in the mid-20s.\nBill Nasgovitz\n$24 million or so?\nBen Naccarato\nYes.\nBill Nasgovitz\nWell, that's encouraging, isn't it? Could you just lay out perhaps the potential in terms of the sodium market that we're now in and also the H2O market down there in Florida?\nMark Duff\nYes, Bill, the H2O market is a lot more subjective because it depends so much on marketing and it's so cost competitive. I would say for us what that means is, if we hit on all cylinders, you could probably do $5 million or $6 million a year there with the Company good wins. And what we think is our near term clients, I am pleased to say that though on the sodium market that the markets much larger because we don't have a lot of competition. In fact, there's no competition honest it's really just a matter of what people what our clients' budgets are.\nThe way that works at Idaho -- excuse me at Northwest is that we get, we have a permit for two years to do, what we call a treatability study. But you're allowed to pretty much demonstrate operational capability of your system while you're getting your permit, which is very -- a very friendly way of supporting new technologies for the State of Washington. And we have about $5 million in backlog for that waste during that two year period. But we're viewing our Veolia us together after sitting down, really analyzing the market out there.\nWe would agree together that the market is closer to $100 million in total inventory that's out there in the system now, over the next 10 years or so. And it can be accelerated or decelerated depending on budget levels. So, it is your question on the sodium side, 5 million backlog right now for the next 18 months or so to 2 years and about $100 million over the next 10 years or so for the total market.\nBill Nasgovitz\nAnd we have no competition, so the margins are -- what kind of margins you expect? And how does this shared with Veolia?\nMark Duff\nWell, that's largely a proprietary, but the margins are good as far as some of our other margins not as aggressive as some other margins we have, but they're good margins and good sustainability. And that's being the only source for this processing doesn't necessarily mean you can charge whatever you want, you have to be reasonable or they'll leave everything in storage. So what we have to balance that out, make sure we're providing a good value. So there is cheaper treat it and get rid of attentiveness to store. And we work very closely with department managing and particularly the Idaho site to work out a long-term arrangement for treatment of their waste as well as looking at other clients as well.\nBill Nasgovitz\nSo, is this a 50:50 partnership with Veolia? What\u2026\nMark Duff\nYes, we really can't get into details on the partnership, Bill, at this point.\nOperator\nThe next question is from the line of Stephen Fine [ph] a private investor. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst\nGreat summary, Mark, just want to appreciate that. Some of my questions -- I have a lot of questions and some of them were answered already. On the 5 million in the sinking fund that you're getting back from the closing plant, you say that 80% is finished relative to the final thing. So, does this mean that there could be more work done that has to be done?\nMark Duff\nYes, that's a good question, Steve. And after reading that out loud, I kind of wondered if it was clear. The way this works is that you have to go through and do complete decontamination and cleaning up the entire facility, anywhere there's contamination and that's been 100% completed. So, we've gone through, scrabble the floors, taken down the drywall, generate a ton of waste, cleaned it all up. And what you have is lagging after that clean-up, you have the final surveys and people are going over to the Geiger counter and basically and survey equipment to make sure there's nothing residual or nothing was missed.\nWe do that while we're doing the contamination as well. This is kind of a final step that's required on your permit to go in with a separate group of people and do that survey. There's four different permits we already finished and closeout three of them completely. So, they've already done that verification process, all done, completely done, already into the state for closure. We're on the last one, so we've finished the cleaning the last one and we're about 3 or 4 weeks away from the final verification process of last one. So, it's very low risk of there's any additional cleanup costs. I can't say that 0% to 60% chance. If you could find something and nugget it here and there you might have to cleanup, but it's very, very minimal in a final quality assurance step. So, we're just about done that last verification process.\nUnidentified Analyst\nSo, you're able to vet what you think is could be there?\nMark Duff\nYes, we're able -- actually, it's going through the final -- we call final QA step, quality assurance step to make sure that everything was done here.\nUnidentified Analyst\nSecond question, regarding the medical and the write-off of a 552 million, I thought in previous earnings report, it was stated that that's over, there's no more cost. So where did that come?\nMark Duff\nSteve, there were two prepaid on the books or one was a receivable and one with a prepaid related to the grant that we've had at the medical company. That grant has been completed, but there was a receivable which we're still discussing with the grant agency on whether we're going to receive or not. So, we thought we felt it prudent to write it off in the event we do not collect it just to move on. The other prepaid that was written off was related to a prepaid fee that was paid to get the grant to bankers and with the grant being finished with a couple tasks not yet finalized due to technical reasons, we again wrote off a prepaid. So, neither were cash, both were sort of -- well, the receivable probably was cash, not received, but the other one was just for a prepaid from a few years.\nUnidentified Analyst\nSo, Ben, is there value there relative to this medical technology? I mean, is there potential value?\nDr. Louis Centofanti\nHey, Steve, this is Lou. Yes, let me -- you know the, what we see with the technology is, yes, there is still value. We have several people still working on the technology program there, working out their cost. So, it's not costing anything. So at this point, we think there is and so we're still providing support on that point.\nUnidentified Analyst\nWith regard to the backlog, there was one comment there that you had going into this year and 11 million backlog, and then when Bill was questioning, the number came out to 7 million. So I guess the question should be, we finished the first quarter's over and so basically was the first quarter, you know, basically on normal track, I mean sales team to being around the same amount for the last three four years. So was at least the fourth quarter on track relative to let's say 2018?\nBen Naccarato\nLet me clarify quick, Mark, and then you can take it. The 7 million I mentioned was the backlog for services, not for treatment. We sort of separate to the 11 is just treatment.\nUnidentified Analyst\nYou're talking -- so, you're talking about potentially 35 million with the 17 million that you're going to sign this month?\nBen Naccarato\nMight be a little high, but close, yes.\nUnidentified Analyst\nOkay, that's wonderful. Mark, do you have something to say? I'm sorry.\nMark Duff\nYes, that 11 million is typically viewed as what we have in our inventory sitting on our sites for treatment. So, its waste we already received or already billed for, but basically we have a signed contract and typically have the waste in our possession. So when you have 11 million inventory backlog for treatment that's pretty much on your site and ready to go.\nUnidentified Analyst\nI have a bunch of comments and please bear with me. I've there written and some of them have been answer already. I was going to start out with the GeoMelt system, and I think Bill asked some really pointed questions there. And I think it needs to be pointed out because I went in a research the earlier and it seems that this GeoMelt system has been you know there have been people in other countries that have been licensed that, but Perma-Fix has been the only company in the United States license or all of the United States. And I think this is a real estate in my mind relating to Perma-Fix, special capabilities relative to that. Is there -- so, you were explaining Mark about how this is progressing, so this has to be further permitted. Is that's what I have to understand here?\nMark Duff\nYes, Steve, basically, it's -- we got rolling very quickly under what we call treatability study. And what you do as you permit, you have a treatability study which includes a pretty significant amount of quantity you can treat under the treatability study. And you pretty are on a position where you can do the treatment, why you are applying for your operational permits. So, the risk of the operational permit is very limited before its getting at, but it's typically it leverages the production and performance of the treatability study to get your permit. So, as a regulator, they want to see that your technology is going to work and it's safe that you have your missions under control and all those types of things to support your permit request. And you add that treatment to your overall permit for the sites. So it's the modification to your existing permit.\nUnidentified Analyst\nYou answered the question. I had a question, how large is the market? You answer that. With one other question I have about the GeoMelt is. Can this system, this GeoMelt system be used for the processing of other types of nuclear waste other than salt rad pipe?\nMark Duff\nYes, it's a good question, Steve. It is important to know that it is a very robust system. You can put a lot of waste and basically at the 5 cubic meter box that you melt at one time. You can only put 30% to 40% of that box could be your waste form and the rest of it has to be basically play sand because it melted all together into one large model.\nSo, it's not -- it\u2019s a bad process, it's not the type of process it continues operation. So its limitations on very, very large quantities of waste that it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, but it does for these types of waste that deals we have a lot of a like drum here and drum there and a piece here to piece there. You can throw it in there with the sand. And you fired up 220 kilowatts of energy that goes into it and makes it into a glass, and it's a very stable waste form that you can dispose of.\nSo, the answer to your question for sodium waste, it's optimal and it is for other types of reactor waste as well, but it certainly doesn't -- it's not the kind of thing you would run like tank waste or any other type of waste in large quantities. So, it just wouldn\u2019t be a feasible.\nUnidentified Analyst\nThere has been a plethora of article this year in the public domain relating to nuclear waste relevant to Perma-Fix. Based on these articles and other public information, first, I want to applaud people of Perma-Fix for the patience, endurance in developing the business landscape. Moreover, I want to applaud DOE for looking at the nuclear and nuclear waste business in a pragmatic, realistic and cost effective way, as the recent closing of the MOX plant in Savannah that had issues with timelines and cost. With all the environment issues facing our government, hard decisions have to be made in order to optimize DOE budget. The test-bed initiative has been as exciting prospect for Perma-Fix where as I read, Perma-Fix can treat in its Pacific Northwest plants next to the Hanford Reservation low-rad waste at the Hanford tank farm at some $300 per gallon versus a low bulk cost of the $1,000 per gallon at the Vit Plant. I have read numbers that such an effort let's say $12 billion in cost savings. And obviously, this could mean hundreds of millions of dollars of sales for Perma-Fix. I understand Phase 1 of this initiative of treating 3 gallons was treated last year. And I note that 90% of the 56 million gallons at a tank farm are estimated by various parties and studies to be low rad. And early this year, there was a public announcement by DOE that Perma-Fix was awarded a $44.8 million for Phase 2 of the TBI or the 2,000 gallons sample with a completion date inclusive of building a pretreatment unit, treating the waste and filing the report of that is due in September. So my question is. How is the Phase 2 work progressing? Is the pretreatment machine finish? And will you meet the September deadline?\nMark Duff\nWe appreciate the question, Steve. The bottom line is TBI has had a lot of -- made a lot of progress this year, there's two components to this, the Perma-Fix piece as well as the remaining piece. On Perma-Fix peace, we have gotten our permit for our mixer which was a hurdle for us as well as our air permit. So, we're ready to receive the waste under Phase 2, the 2,000 gallons. DOE is progressing on their permitting side of the house and they're still working through that process with the State of Washington and getting over these hurdles. So, that's the second component of the process is the permitting side and DOE.\nAnd then the third piece or the other components which are the tank extraction system that Colombia Energy is supporting along with the rest of the TBI team. That's made great progress and Colombia energy, last time, I checked was like a week ago is through 90% design and construction. And I have a mock up or I believe they actually have the unit complete or 90% completed in a mockup type of form. And are testing it now, we're getting ready to -- so, the engineering construction of tank extraction system unit is also moving along very well.\nSo to answer your question, I think it's going to be a little bit delay based on some of the permitting side of the house with DOE has to get through. There is still some risk there as far as timelines to go, but the project is moving along. And currently the schedule for the 2,000 gallons is this fall. So, things are still happening. I think we're very encouraged by the fact that I believe it\u2019s a President's budget had TBI in as a line item for $10 million for 2020. So, we're really pleased that DOE still recognizing. This is a viable supplemental treatment capability for the site.\nUnidentified Analyst\nThere were articles in a large pretreatment machine being designed for the Vit Plant for separating low-and high-rad nuclear waste at a much higher rate. I think it's 8 to 10 gallons per minute. So, what is the status of installation and permitting of this pretreatment machine?\nMark Duff\nThat's not in our scope, Steve. That was in the WRPS contract. So, I don't have a status on that. But I know it's ongoing. They made an award and they're moving forward. I'm just not sure the status of it.\nUnidentified Analyst\nSo is this machine going to be the pretreatment machine for the Vit Plant sites?\nMark Duff\nI can't praise you. I can't address all the objectives associated with that equipment.\nDr. Louis Centofanti\nSteve, let me respond. Yes, the Vantec unit is there, it's going through its final permitting also. It will be the pretreatment for as it stands today for the pre-treating the waste before it goes through the Vit Plant or before it comes to us.\nUnidentified Analyst\nSo then one can presume that it can be -- it would be used for larger quantities when and if the test-bed initiative requires larger quantities of low-rad waste for treatment?\nDr. Louis Centofanti\nIt would be -- it should be an option.\nUnidentified Analyst\nOkay, I note that the same week, that Perma-Fix was awarded the second phase of the TBI. The deal we announce 2019 current cost estimates to finish cleaning up Hanford. According to the article, the last cost estimate was in 2016 was about 130 billion to complete all the Hanford cleanup. The 2019 estimate by DOE was quite shocking and that is tripled on the low side to 400 billion and the high side was much a 600 billion. And DOE estimated that work could extend to 20:80 which could mean parts or systems of the completed in Hanford what have to be replaced because of wearing out overtime. The article suggests that other ways of processing the waste needs to be explored based on the stark escalated cost increase. So my question is. How do you look at this increased cost estimation by DOE?\nMark Duff\nWe certainly believe that it plays well for evaluation of alternatives. There's a lot of other factors here and they play into this whole initiative. We feel obviously that the technology we have, we would be very applicable to the tank processing for the low level tank waste. And if you work with BOE to make sure that it's move forward, we can't really address the article that came out. We know we're talking about that we shown dramatic increases in total lifecycle costs. And we do believe our technology is about 10 times less, but the folks in DOE we've been working very closely with us, have been very supportive of us, and we're always moving through the process to get to a point where we can demonstrate it in a largest scale.\nUnidentified Analyst\nI note that last week, Rick Perry, the Secretary of DOE was in front of Congress and underscored the state of escalating costs have hampered and that new approaches are being explored. I ask no comments on that, I think you've answered that. I now move to the tank closure contract. Question, has the bid day closed? Or has it passed? Has the contract closed?\nMark Duff\nAs far as -- and this is all initial public information, Steve, but the RFP, excuse me, the proposals were submitted and response to the RFP on March 21 by all the bidders and my understanding now Steve is that they're just getting ready to enter into an oral presentation session with each of the bidders here in the next couple of weeks. That's kind of the status of it.\nUnidentified Analyst\nAs I read this bid request, this contract is radically changed by DOE and that its spirit is to pre-treat and treat low-rad waste. Am I still here? Hello\u2026\nMark Duff\nYes, Steve, you're here.\nUnidentified Analyst\nThe contract is radically changed by DOE and that its spirit is to pre-treat and treat low-rad waste as well as to maintain the 56 million gallons of waste in the tank farm, thus the name change from tank maintenance to tank closure. The present contract that expires this September just involved maintenance of the 56 million gallons for when the Vit Plant was ready to treat the 56 million gallon, but pursuant to winning the new contractor there, the contractor aside but continued to be responsible to maintain the 56 million gallons in the tanks farm. The contractor has to have a pretreatment capability to separate low and high-rad waste and also provides a delivered cost of shipping to low-rad waste to treatment facility. And I emphasize the word treatment facility and not Vit Plant, but the key point is that cleaning up waste reduces the maintenance cost of waste in the tank farm. And I read the existing maintenance contract was a 7 million or so per contract per year or I am assuming 7 billion over 10 years. Anyway, this contract has been now -- expanded cost-wise with the limit of $30 billion for 10 years, which is about 4 billion or 5 billion more potentially, which I would presume would be for pretreatment and treatment of low-rad waste. So here's my question and there're a couple. So, what you guys think of this contract? How do you bid it? And if so, are you bidding in partnership with larger players? And if so, who are they?\nMark Duff\nThose are all great questions, Steve, and I can argue, all your numbers are spot on. But I guess I would ask that -- to have some understanding that we're already in a procurement situation, we're involved in procurement and therefore we can't tell you anything about the procurement itself, who are we teamed with or anything. It would be sensitive information and that we hope that we can talk about here in a couple of quarters, but there's really nothing we can say. It's so procurement sensitive, Steve, at this point.\nOperator\nIn the interest of time, we have to take the next question but we encourage everyone to [indiscernible] with follow-up questions. The next question comes from the line of Tom Deacon [ph], a private investor.\nTom Deacon\nYes, I just have one question with regard to TBI. You had a difference of opinion with the State of Washington where they have been -- you're trying to renew a contract that I think you've been working on it for last 10 years. But anyway, my point is that you potentially could treat the second 2,000 gallons at Hanford or you can ship into Tennessee. And my question is, when you are you going to make that decision? I mean it sounds like it's up in the year at this point?\nMark Duff\nYes, what you're referring to Tom is the renewal of our req for permit, which has been ongoing for since 2009, which we are making progress with the state on now and hope to have that in place. The Tennessee was a backup alternative for Perma-Fix Northwest. It's certainly our desire and hope that we would be able to do it Northwest, and at this point, we could expect it there. And our current conditions as long as the state supported under our existing license, and -- but we did receive the permit for our mixer, which was the other thing was potentially holding it up and that's been supported by the state as well as our air permit. So, we should be pretty much good to go in northwest right now as far as I understand. Lou, is there anything to add about that?\nDr. Louis Centofanti\nNo. Yes, I think at this stage, at this point of state, it is supported by us at our site. So, we don\u2019t -- the Tennessee was a backup if there were problems with our permit, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case at this point.\nUnidentified Analyst\nSo, that's a real news because the last thing that I read was just a couple of few weeks ago in the Tri-City paper there that they have by Hanford. And the Washington, there was somebody in the ecology department or -- and it sounded like they wanted to be super, super, super, super careful before they allowed you to do that waste rather than shipping than shipping.\nDr. Louis Centofanti\nI guess as Mark said, the option is one is. As we sit today, we have all the permits we need and they are very well defined in the state as given them to us. Here from, if in the end they come up and say, we can't do it then our backup as we move to the Tennessee.\nUnidentified Analyst\nThat would add costs, though, right? I mean it's going to -- it has a certain amount of costs to ship that business.\nDr. Louis Centofanti\nOur shipping costs are fairly minimal.\nUnidentified Analyst\nThe other thing I was wondering about is. It looks like you're really growing the Company nice. I think you have -- everybody has to give a credit to Mark for the great job that he has done since he has come on board. Have you -- I know it's tough to get a talent, but have you been hiring people like you know like I mean higher level people more. Are you planning on expanding I mean it sounds like you're getting a lot of extra work?\nMark Duff\nWell, thanks for kind words, Tom. We do have a great team and there people made a lot of adjustments to support these wins and hopefully we have a much more again this year. But, yes, we actually are hiring project management positions as well as safety positions and field folks as well. So, we have a number of positions open on our website and are in the process of hiring now.\nUnidentified Analyst\nAnd my last question is, I think it wouldn't take a whole lot for you guys to get with this plant closure behind you and additional work. I mean, it wouldn't take a whole lot for you guys to become cash flow positive. Can you see that happening this year?\nBen Naccarato\nYes, if all goes to plan with the cash flow effective, we would definitely and we were cash flow positive last year as well from operations. So, yes, we definitely think we would generate good liquidity in the plan where we see coming up.\nMark Duff\nWe are very optimistic we will we were with M&EC, particularly behind us this year looks much better.\nUnidentified Analyst\nGood. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator\nOur next question is from the line of Chuck Dickinson [ph], private investor. Please proceed with your question.\nChuck Dickinson\nQuestions, I want to drill down just a little bit further on this permitting process with the Washington Department of Ecology. And it sounds like it's progressing I know you've been working with them on that for an extended period of time. Can you give any more color on both the timing and the likelihood of that permitting, when it's going to occur? And what would happen in the interim, if there's any sort of further delay? I don't know how long you can keep going under the current extensions that you have. What I want to have a good feeling about is that you can keep doing everything that you need to do up there in Washington, while this process is taking place with the hope that it comes to fruition and ends at some point and you could get re-permitted or the new permit.\nMark Duff\nYes, Chuck, just a couple of things and I'll let Lou to jump in, but we'll just kind of give you status. We just finished our public comment period and had a public hearing here mid-March and went very well. There were lots of support from the public and from city officials. And so, we're very, we're very comfortable with where we are in a community and we have that support. The state has been working well with us the last year or so.\nThere's been disagreements here and there we're working through the issues to make sure that the permit that we can get the renewal we get, addresses all of the things have changed in the last 10 years, all the things have been added. And those have been added formally and making sure that's our permit robust enough to handle what we're doing now we'll be planning to do it.\nSo, the risk is very low, the state has been very supportive. And frankly, Chuck, the state understands the importance of Perma-Fix as it relates to the closure mission at Hanford. We create a lot of wastes to Hanford that wouldn't have any other alternatives or if it did would be very expensive. So, it's important plant for the environment and for the city as well as the Hanford site and the DOE mission. So, we feel that support, it's taking a lot longer than we thought. But we're pretty confident it won't have any impact on our ongoing operation or future operations. Lou, is there anything to add to that?\nDr. Louis Centofanti\nYes, the only thing I would add which really important to understand is under RCRA, which is the permit that we're working on hazardous materials. We will continue indefinitely in the future under the renewal process. There is -- that will continue. There's no risk with that unless the states have we want you to close. So, at this point as long as we're moving forward, there's no risk to our permanent.\nUnidentified Analyst\nOkay. The only other question I had was the sort of new information here on this Department of Energy and state guidelines or initiative or whatever they've come up with here. I mean you sort of made a real passing reference with regard to how that might favor works you want to do in terms of routing? Do you want to just leave that comment there? Or would you like to elaborate on that a little bit more? Or I don't know, but people have had a have a real sense at least I don't have a real sense that this end state initiative? What exactly it means and just how positive could potentially be?\nMark Duff\nYes. So, I'll just say this Chuck and it's all in that RFP, which is quite like the RFP is. The Department of Energy is looking at projects like what we used to call the tank operating contract, which Steve mentioned, the existing contract. And the contract it was not necessarily incentivized as much to close operations and closed down. There were the way this contract was structured, the changes is in the contract structure is. This new one is that there's great emphasis on completion, on closing tanks. And as it relates to that, as what we offer relates to that, we have a technology that would be able to be utilized to close tanks. And so, to the extent the DOE is looking for that and an award, we certainly have something to offer in regards to a proven technology in its local.\nUnidentified Analyst\nYou had also mentioning or maybe you'd mentioned that under the Phase 2 that you folks have your permitting site, but pretty much ready to go. I assume the DOE gets approval on what they need to do. Is it sensitive to Phase 2? Do indeed take place in Washington that great enhances the possibility of Phase 3 also being done there. In other words, it sounded like, I think the Department of Ecology wanted to say, maybe there's a separate permitting process as you go from a Phase 2 or Phase 3. Am I correct in that? Or is it not really looked out yet?\nMark Duff\nYes, it's safe to say I think, Chuck, the Phase 2 gets rolling. There is good potential for it to roll right into an operational phase. Now, I think the question you're really asking. What kind of quantities are we talking about? And there maybe some limitations on total quantities, you have gallons per year or gallons per month or something like that. But overall, if it once Phase 2 just rolling, you will be in a position to continue, hopefully, continue operations at least for a limited period of time until the next phase or the next level is addressed in regards to quantities.\nOperator\nOur next question is follow-up from the line Stephen Fine [ph], a private investor.\nUnidentified Analyst\nI wasn't done so, but in all due respect. You've bought out one thing that I was asking. Does DOE have any power relative to permitting with the Washington State Ecology?\nMark Duff\nThe power is a difficult word to address, Steve.\nUnidentified Analyst\nWhatever the word is to help effectuate it?\nMark Duff\nThey are independent agency, I know, EPA were -- is they have authority under EPA, the state does. And certainly, if DOE was not supportive, it would be difficult to get supportive EPA. I think that's a subjective statement. But Lou, do you have anything else to add about that being\u2026\nDr. Louis Centofanti\nNo, that's a hard question.\nUnidentified Analyst\nOkay, alright, I appreciate that. I'm almost done. I'm almost done. So just bear with me. I also our note that 1/3/19, there was an article written in the Tricentennial Herald that said, there is going to be a contract coming out later in the year that will award a contractor to treat and maintain the one, the waste once the Vit Plant is done. So my question is, if that is so then why is DOE awarding such a contract years before the Vit Plant is completed?\nMark Duff\nAre you referring to -- when you said about awarding a contract, are you talking about the\u2026\nUnidentified Analyst\nWell, there was an article in you can look this up in the Tricentennial Herald on 1/3/19, and the writer stated that there was a contract coming out or supposedly a new contract coming out later in the year that will create a contractor to treat and maintain the waste once the Vit Plant is done. So, the accent of the article was that, hey, the operator, the person that's building the Vit Plant is not going to operate it. There's going to be a bidding process for a contractor. So, if that is so and you know you have no answer, you have no answer. If that is so, I'm just curious why this is being done so early when supposedly the finishing of the Vit Plant and thereof is not in the immediate future.\nMark Duff\nI'm afraid, Steve, I'm not sure what's they're trying to do in there.\nUnidentified Analyst\nOkay, alright, leave it alone, leave it alone. I throw it out. I just want to thank you for all your efforts, as a stockholder of Perma-Fix, a concerned citizen of the United States relative to nuclear waste and an engineer whose career centered on hazardous chemicals. It seems clear that a change is needed in treating nuclear waste particularly in light of cost escalation, other environmental problems facing our government and particularly it hampered the chance of an earthquake and/or a black swan event that negates any clean up and potentially makes the West Coast inhabitable.\nWe must realize that time is of the essence and the enemy. It seems treatment of nuclear waste must be approached from a different perspective. As a Perma-Fix stockholder and U.S. citizen, I applaud Perma-Fix for positioning to assist and participate in the possible paradigm shift required vis-a-vis treating nuclear waste in a different way that is faster and more cost efficient. So, thank you guys.\nOperator\nThank you. At this time, I will turn the floor back to management for closing remarks.\nMark Duff\nAlright, thank you. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for participating in our fourth quarter conference call and all the questions today. As I've mentioned earlier, our backlog and sales pipeline is growing. We were recently awarded a number of important contracts on our services segment and are bidding on many more, several of which could be substantial, and we are working toward several large projects within the treatment segment as well that could be transformative. We look forward to updating you again next quarter. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nThank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "text": "Score hidden \u00b7 just now They definitely know but it\u2019s not a good strategy to advertise that fact. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re working on a fix and that the 2018 models will probably be included in the repair list like the 2016 and 2017 models. But I doubt they\u2019re working a permafix on the current generations keyboards. Get it fixed, do it again, etc., then the 4-year extra coverage runs it\u2019s course. Congrats, you\u2019re a proud owner of a flat and wide Mac mini with a screen and trackpad when the keyboard inevitably fails again. Go long in shares of companies that make TB3 cords to leave your new desktop permafixed to an external display. Or do what cool people like me do and use an external keyboard on a MBP and feel like fool. \ud83d\ude02 Reply",

            "text": "2 hours ago One thing about Apple Card I don\u2019t hear anyone talking about...integration in financial applications. Since the introduction of Apple Card I\u2019ve been really excited. It matches the cash back from my current card, but doesn\u2019t require $2,500 in purchases to redeem the cash back. However, there\u2019s one deal breaker standing in the way. Mint/Quicken/Personal Cap support. I love to track all my banking and cards in one place (I use mint personally). But since all we\u2019ve seen so far is that it\u2019ll integrate directly into the wallet app, I wonder if it would even support those services. In it doesn\u2019t. Then I think I might have to pass on Apple\u2019s latest and greatest.",

The pair is also anticipated to field questions from select analysts.\nFollowing a rare guidance revision in January, Apple posted earnings of $84.3 billion in revenue on the back of $52 billion in iPhone sales. Despite a handset revenue contraction of 15 percent year-over-year, the company touted a 19 percent uptick in overall growth driven in large part by solid sales in other sectors.\n\"While it was disappointing to miss our revenue guidance, we manage Apple for the long term, and this quarter's results demonstrate that the underlying strength of our business runs deep and wide,\" Cook said during last quarter's conference call.\nIn line with recent quarters, Apple's services arm continued to follow an upward trajectory during the three-month period ending in December. The segment raked in $10.9 billion, an all-time high. Services are expected to boom throughout 2019 and 2020 as Apple introduces a slate of new products to its existing App Store, AppleCare, Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud and iTunes offerings.\nApple's services roadmap was unveiled at a special event last week, with the first of the new products, subscription news service Apple News+ , arriving as part of iOS 12.2 . Other initiatives, like Apple TV Channels and Apple TV+ , game subscription service Apple Arcade , and the Goldman Sachs-backed Apple Card , are due out later this year.\nFor the current quarter, Apple is forecasting revenue between $55 billion and $59 billion, with gross margin estimated to fall between 37 percent and 38 percent. Operating expenses are expected to lie between between $8.5 billion and $8.6 billion.\nAppleInsider will offer full coverage of the earnings call on Tuesday, April 30, starting at 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern.",

            "text": "Quick Take Resideo Technologies ( REZI ) announced it has acquired Buoy Labs for an undisclosed amount.\nBuoy Labs operates as a smart home Internet of Things [IoT] company with a focus on household water usage and response.\nREZI's deal for Buoy provides it with a natural addition to its existing product lines and can be sold through existing channels; the deal makes excellent strategic sense.\nTarget Company Santa Cruz, California-based Buoy Labs was founded in 2015 to develop Buoy, an IoT device that tracks household water usage and delivers real-time data through a subscription-based app.\nManagement was headed by CEO and Co-Founder Keri Waters , who was previously CEO at Vivo Technology.\nBelow is an overview video of what Buoy is all about:\nSource: YouTube\nCompany partners or major customers include:\nDelta Faucet Company Elemental Excelerator Source: Buoy\nInvestors have invested $60K in the company and include Elemental Excelerator and Highway1. Source: Crunchbase\nMarket & Competition According to a market research report by Zion Market Research, the global consumer IoT market was valued at $46.6 billion in 2018 and is projected to reach $143.5 billion by 2025.\nThis represents a very strong CAGR of 17.4% between 2019 and 2025.\nThe main driver for this expected growth is the increase in the number of IoT-based consumer applications, including smart homes, security systems, wearable tech, and personal assistants.\nThe Asia-Pacific region is projected to grow at the fastest rate due to rapid urbanization and industrialization in developing countries such as China and India.\nMajor vendors that provide smart home IoT water meters include:\nFlo Technologies FLUID Labs SmarterHomes Technologies StreamLabs Source: Sentieo\nAcquisition Terms and Rationale Resideo did not disclose the acquisition price or terms and didn't file a Form 8-K or provide a change in financial guidance, so the deal was likely for a financially non-material amount.\nA review of the firm's most recent 10-K filing indicates that as of December 31, 2018, REZI had $265 million in cash and equivalents and $3.4 billion in total liabilities, of which, long-term debt represented $1.2 billion.\nFree cash flow during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, was $398 million.\nIn the past 6 months, REZI's stock price has dropped 38.7% vs. competitor ADT's ( ADT ) drop of 25.6%, as the chart below indicates:\nSource: Sentieo\nIn the roughly six months since its public debut, REZI has produced uneven earnings results vs. expectations:\nSource: Seeking Alpha\nAnalyst ratings are uniformly in a 'Buy' status and the current consensus price target of $26.75 implies a potential upside of 34% from its current stock price of $19.92 at press time:\nSource: Seeking Alpha\nAnalyst sentiment in the most recent earnings call has dropped markedly from the previous call:\nSource: Sentieo\nCommentary REZI has acquired Buoy to expand its service offerings into the home water tracking business.\nAs Mike Nefkens, Resideo CEO stated in the deal announcement:\nBuoy Labs is the first move in our ongoing strategic initiative to identify and execute on tuck-in acquisitions. Their products and talent are a natural fit for Resideo's portfolio of professionally installed and monitored smart home solutions that integrate the critical systems of the home.\nWith this first acquisition as a standalone company after spinning out from Honeywell ( HON ), REZI hopes to expand its addressable market and increase its 'share of wallet.'\nFrom a strategic perspective, the deal makes perfect sense. It can be sold through REZI's existing channels and it reduces the number of vendors that consumers need to coordinate with to track their home energy and resource usage.\nThe Buoy system also provides for a subscription revenue model, which results in lower upfront costs for consumers and a more predictable revenue stream for REZI.\nI expect to see further 'tuck-in' acquisitions from REZI related to home management products and services.\nAlthough REZI's stock has performed poorly since its spin-out, acquisitions like these make complete sense and are a signal of management's clear thinking about how to expand business opportunities in the most efficient manner.\nI research IPOs and technology M&A deals.\nMembers of my proprietary research service IPO Edge get the latest IPO research, news, market trends, and industry analysis.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dr. Carl Schwartz, CEO of Precision Therapeutics. Dr. Schwartz.\nDr. Carl Schwartz\nThank you very much Scott. Good afternoon and welcome. This is I think a really exciting time for Precision Therapeutics. We now have four divisions under or soon to under our control to our shareholders I will talk about. First is Skyline Medical that now has both a domestic and foreign division of its own and is very active in 2018. As such it was a pivotal year. Here are some highlights; we continue to expand our sales efforts not only nationally but worldwide. We hired a new Head of Domestic Sales, expanded our sales force with more experienced personnel, established a European office and hired a Director of Sales.\nI want to point out that although we did not hit our projections in 2018 we still had sales of machines and disposables that set new records for Skyline. We saw independent distributors in Canada, several European countries, many in the Middle East, India, Pakistan, Australia, Taiwan just to name a few and we now have machines in five of the world's seven continents and our efforts continue unabated into 2019. In addition we formed the TumorGenesis division in 2018 to develop the use of biomarkers to test ovarian tumors and to replace lab rats and mice which are more expensive to use, take longer to get results, and these results are less reliable. We also purchased 25% of Helomics, bioinformatics company specializing in ovarian cancer. We have been moving along smartly on the development of our new Generation 3 machine which will be smaller, more compact with fewer moving parts. In addition this new machine will have a separate attachable backing comp available for purchase to help hospitals with limited vacuum.\n2019 has also gotten off to a great start. We will finalize our purchase of Helomics and in the next couple of days we will own 100% of this exciting corporation. We have continued to expand Skyline by widening our sales force to cover more of the world, improved our marketing and our training of hospital personnel to maintain our machines. Our new Generation 3 machine will be out for testing in May and will be available shortly thereafter.\nNow let's talk about TumorGenesis. Richard Gabriel, Head of TumorGenesis has not let any grass grow under his feet. TumorGenesis was formed to develop a new rapid approach for growing and testing ovarian tumors in the laboratory using biomarkers which essentially fools the cancer cells into thinking they're still growing inside the patient and replace the use of lab rats and mice. TumorGenesis has continued to move rapidly signing contracts with developers and suppliers of these biomarkers. These suppliers have built the first biomarker screening kits and sent them to a large U.S. university for evaluations on 14 of the 25 ovarian cancer cell types on behalf of TumorGenesis.\nIn addition these proprietary media screening kits will be offered commercially worldwide so that other researchers may grow the ovarian cancer cells themselves and they will want to purchase the TumorGenesis biomarker discovery kits to screen their own samples. Following up on the work done at this university TumorGenesis will then take these biomarkers found in the first screening and mount them on supports to search for new cancer cells preparation. This protocol will result in the production of the TumorGenesis capture kit. This will bring us one step closer to building tumors outside of the body which will in reality match the patient's own tumor. It's really groundbreaking research if I do say so myself.\nNow we come to Precision Therapeutics latest acquisition Helomics Corporation. As I stated earlier we will own 100% of Helomics in a couple of days. It's corporate mission as stated by our VP of Innovation, Mark Collins, machine learning can discover drugs and make people better and with that single minded purpose we intend to become the leading artificial intelligence company dedicated to women's cancer. Over the past 20 years over $200 million was invested in Helomics to build one of the largest databases of ovarian, breast, and brain cancers in the country. By applying our deep learning software to these cancers we will bring realistic hope to thousands of women with these cancers. Over the next several months we have already and will continue to enter into collaborations with data sharing agreements with other companies in the field to expand our database on these three cancers. Our deep learning software will help to determine what drug combinations will be most effective for each cancer subtype and help pharmaceutical companies to develop them.\nTo achieve our goals we have assembled a world class -- really world class Advisory Board consisting of these strategic luminaries; Dr. Bob Murphy, Professor of Biological Sciences, Biomedical Engineering, and Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University. Amelia Warner recently built and sold two entrepreneurial companies, prior to that she served as Head of Clinical Pharmacogenomics for Merck Research Laboratories overseeing all pharmacogenomics projects. Marc Malandro, VP of Operations for Science at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative established and owned by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Pricilla Chan. And finally Dr. Paul Kornblith, a world renowned Neurosurgeon, Clinician, and Clinical Cancer Researcher. Investors can watch our progress like following our collaboration with business leaders to validate our approach and increase the number of tumors available to Helomics to perform genomics sequencing on.\nOne of our goals is to secure a partner similar to how Foundation Medicine with Roche in 2016. At that time Foundation had information on 18,000 tumors. We have over 150,000 tumors in our data bank and our job is to mind them as Foundation did. Again really, really exciting stuff. And with that I will pass the call to Bob Myers, our CFO who will now discuss our financial results for the fiscal year-ended December 31, 2018. And then we will open the call for questions. Bob.\nBob Myers\nThank you Carl. I will now discuss the financial results for the full year of 2018. Revenue, our revenue for 2018 was $1,412,000 compared with $655,000 for 2017. This represents a 116% increase year-over-year. Our revenue included the sale of 41 STREAMWAY systems and increased disposable supplies. The revenue in 2017 included the sale of 10 STREAMWAY systems as well as disposable supplies to operate the product. Our revenues and product sales increased in 2018 due to our increased sales force and the full initiation of brand awareness. We also sold our first STREAMWAY unit internationally.\nCost of sales, our cost of sales was $416,000 in 2018 compared to $148,000 in 2017. Please note that as our revenues increased through system sales we expect costs to decline as a percentage of our revenue due to our volume discount purchasing agreement with our suppliers. Gross profit margin, our gross profit margin decreased slightly to 71% in 2018 compared to 77% in 2017. In 2017 we experienced a higher gross profit percentage than in 2018 as the company began assisting some customers with the installation cost. In turn this added a value cost to our customers resulting in a higher sales.\nOperating expenses, our operating expenses for the year-ended December 31, 2018 were $8,900,000 compared with $6,600,000 in 2017. The $2,300,000 increase in operating expenses in 2018 contained numerous extraordinary expenses including acquisition cost, forbearance expenses, and start up expenses for TumorGenesis and Skyline Europe. Thank you Carl and I'd like to turn this call back to you for your closing remarks.\nDr. Carl Schwartz\nThanks Bob. I guess I've covered a lot of territory this afternoon as you might have already heard. It is an exciting time for our company, things have never looked better. We want to thank our loyal shareholders for their continued support and will now turn this over to Q&A.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Dan Peter [ph]. Please go ahead with your question\nUnidentified Analyst\nYeah, I was interested in the original 1 million shares that were placed in Escrow was dependent on I think $8 million worth of earnings by Helomics annually and looking at the merger report for nine months ending September 2018 total income appears to be 425,065, how are you addressing that shortfall?\nDr. Carl Schwartz\nWell, I would tell you that yes, we were disappointed in the beginning but we're off to a good start this year and we're looking at the collaboration that have really accelerated with our Helomics and the cooperation of other companies to build this database and to help other companies to develop theirs. So we expect that income level to rise dramatically over the course of the year. They got off to a kind of a rocky start but I think we've corrected that and they are on their way.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Steve Puchaki [ph]. Please go ahead with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst\nHey guys, so you just made a comment about the database and kind of comparing it to the Foundation database and Roche acquiring it, what kind of shape is our database in currently, how rich is the data, and how close are we to being able to monetize if you will?\nDr. Carl Schwartz\nWell, first of all our tumors are in great shape and we have a lot of information. What we don't have is the sequencing which Foundation did with theirs and we're in the process of setting it up to do that now. So it would be a long process. Not meaning years but certainly months and really expensive to get that done. But we will get it done and then we really have one of the most valuable troughs of information in the country by any measure. And so we are -- and plus that database continues to grow we get new tumors daily to be sequenced and checked out and we're now developing a process again to sequence the tumors we already have. So, that's the difference between Foundation and ourselves, among other differences because that's the main one.\nUnidentified Analyst\nOkay, and would you say that's like 3, 6, 9, 12 month process, I would say over estimate just to kind of\u2026?\nDr. Carl Schwartz\nI would think [indiscernible] probably a good year we can get all this done but maybe a year, maybe a little bit late but it would be at least that.\nUnidentified Analyst\nOkay, and then cash flow wise how much cash do we have currently and what's our burn rate, when are we going to have to raise again?\nDr. Carl Schwartz\nBob.\nDr. Carl Schwartz\nOh, hey Steve. Right now we are sitting with about $1 million in the account. Our burn rate for Skyline Medical runs in about $440,000 a month. We are at a higher rate due to the fact that we're churning out the Generation 3 model supporting TumorGenesis and supporting Skyline Europe. And then Helomics is running in the area of about $300,000 a month. We do expect to need to go out to the public again. We have an available baby shelf on an S3 that we could do that with. And we have some other offerings in mind that we will present to the shareholder community in the future.\nUnidentified Analyst\nOkay, now on previous calls we've talked about Helomics and cash flowing, it was real close. For some reason I recall we expected a Q1 breakeven point. Are we ways off of that yet?\nDr. Carl Schwartz\nWell we're slowing than we anticipated. What happened basically is that Helomics was a little behind than where they thought they were. In working with the artificial intelligence chip they've made huge strides since then and that involving themselves directly and that slowed our performance in terms of the diagnostic medication which is the business that we don't want to be in any way. We're doing that successfully with testing results but to also receive tumors every day that enhance our database. So I think that we would be closer to a breakeven on the Helomics side of things as we near year-end this year.\nUnidentified Analyst\nOkay, what about TumorGenesis, would have that fit as far as monetizing it and what's the burn rate on TumorGenesis?\nDr. Carl Schwartz\nFor the burn rate on TumorGenesis is very low. Actually we had a COO that is being paid a consulting fee. We pay out quarterly fees at $15,000.00 to our associated companies, and now we're getting involved with the university that will be running some of our processes in partnership. That will cost us over the next nine months approximately -- I'm sorry over the next three months approximately $100,000. The future will bring some additional cost to TumorGenesis but I think we're going to look to partner up on that and find a way to allay a lot of those costs. But in the meantime Richard has already begun the process of monetizing, he's got his kit built. We have presented it and we're looking to find out just how well that's going to sell in the very, very near future.\nUnidentified Analyst\nOkay, is there an expected date that we anticipate the Board to kind of start bringing value if you will and maybe some of the relationships that they have creating some more revenue and relationships and kind of help us move forward?\nDr. Carl Schwartz\nSay it again if you could.\nUnidentified Analyst\nI was just asking about the Board and when we are going to kind of see some of the relationships that they had previously built to help us out and move us forward?\nDr. Carl Schwartz\nYou're talking about now TumorGenesis or Helomics or both?\nUnidentified Analyst\nI guess that's Helomics Board.\nDr. Carl Schwartz\nYes, well we -- we are the Helomics Board now and we expect to see them in the 20 days begin to bring -- to put things up pretty good. We've got a number of things to be announced that we're excited about and I think we will begin to see -- we will begin to move rather rapidly with this company.\nBob Myers\nAnd Carl if I may add I think to the Advisory Board Member.\nDr. Carl Schwartz\nYes, yes exactly.\nBob Myers\nYes, I think that's what we are -- and I think -- go ahead Carl, you can\u2026\nDr. Carl Schwartz\nNo, go ahead Bob because I misunderstood the question, I apologize.\nBob Myers\nNo problem, we actually expect a lot to happen from our Advisory Board Members now that the merger will be completed in the next few days. These are people that have been helping us along the way. Amelia Warner has helped us along the way, Marc Malandro. I mean they're not, they haven't been invisible to us by any way, shape, or form but there was just so much that could be done until we put the merger together. And now that that is virtually complete I expect that over the next three to six months that the shareholders would see some good progress made and a lot of it will come from those people directly.\nUnidentified Analyst\nOkay, and the stock price and the dollar, when do we have to have the extension in and we can put in for six month extension, is that correct?\nDr. Carl Schwartz\nYou're right on target. We have to -- we have until May 15th for the stock to recover on its own. That still gives us approximately a month and a half. We released the stock under normal NASDAQ rules has to remain $1 or more at the selling bid price when it closes for tenth consecutive trading days. The NASDAQ does have the right to increase that to a 20 day period if they so desire. They haven't indicated that but I just have to alert you to it. If we do that then the notification from NASDAQ goes away and we're back in compliance. If not on May 15th we will submit to NASDAQ a plan of how we will get our stock above the dollar mark and we have six months in order to do that and we will present a plan that will happen favorably and hopefully as reasonable to the shareholders as possible well before then.\nUnidentified Analyst\nOkay, that's fun. Thank you, appreciate it guys.\nOperator\nAnd ladies and gentlemen with that we will conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "text": "Apple Is Willing to Sacrifice Apple TV for Apple TV+ Adam Levy, The Motley Fool Reblog Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is really taking this services thing to heart. When the company took the wraps off its paid subscription Apple TV+ service, it also unveiled a host of platforms customers will be able to stream the service from. Most notably, TV+ will be available on Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Fire TV devices. That's not really a big surprise after Apple said at CES earlier this year that it would make iTunes available on Samsung smart TVs. After that announcement, I wrote, \"Apple will charge customers for access to its content and work to make it available on as many popular platforms as possible. That could mean a partnership with Roku and Amazon as well.\" While Apple has 1.4 billion active devices in use, only a small handful of those are Apple TVs. Roku and Fire TV are, by far, the most popular way to watch streaming video on TV screens, and their lead is growing . Apple TV+ logo. Image source: Apple. People stream television on their televisions Apple controls a significant market share of smartphones and an even bigger share of tablets. It also has a sizable installed base of Mac computers. But Apple's share of TV-connected streaming devices is relatively small. Just 15% of streamers used an Apple TV device, according to a Parks Associates survey from last year. By comparison, Roku and Amazon held 37% and 28% shares, respectively. A similar survey from William Blair analysts last summer found 27% and 29% of consumers stream video on a Roku or Fire TV, respectively, compared to just 16% that use Apple TV. It also found 30% of consumers stream video via the built-in operating system on their smart TV. By partnering with Roku and Amazon, as well as a handful of smart TV manufacturers, Apple will more than quintuple its reach on televisions. That's important because the television is still where most people watch television. Netflix says 70% of its subscribers' viewing hours are on connected televisions. If Apple couldn't reach its potential audience where they want to stream video, Apple TV+ would be DOA. Is it worth it? Apple is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on content for TV+. While its content budget isn't nearly the size of Netflix's $12 billion cash outlay on content in 2018, it still requires a level of scale for the investment to pay off. It might not need Netflix-like scale, but it needs more scale than the built-in Apple TV user base could offer. Ultimately, however, Apple is sacrificing the opportunity to use TV+ as a selling tool for its hardware -- a strategy that was practically presumed until the recent announcement. But the sacrifice might not be that big. Apple didn't mention any support for Android devices, so if users want to stream on mobile they might need to buy into the iOS ecosystem. And Apple generates much more revenue from iPhone and iPad sales than it does Apple TV. That revenue is very likely more profitable as well. It's impossible to tell whether this strategy will result in a more profitable company. But considering the massive television audience outside of Apple's hardware reach and the relatively small size of Apple TV in the company's business, the risk is certainly worth it.

            "text": "SAN DIEGO & BEVERLY, Mass.- Shareholder rights law firm Robbins Arroyo LLP announces that purchasers of American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ARA) filed a class action complaint against the company for alleged violations of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 between August 10, 2016 and March 27, 2019. American Renal Associates is a dialysis services provider in the United States.\nView this information on the law firm's Shareholder Rights Blog: https://www.robbinsarroyo.com/american-renal-associates-holdings-mar-19/\nAmerican Renal Accused of Improper Accounting Practices\nAccording to the complaint, throughout the class period, American Renal consistently asserted in SEC filings that its disclosures were accurate, but nevertheless failed to disclose to the investing public that there were issues with its accounting process and that it lacked adequate internal controls over financial reporting. The truth began to emerge on November 9, 2018 when American Renal disclosed in a 10Q that the SEC requested documents regarding revenue recognition, collections and related matters. On March 8, 2019, before the market opened, American Renal announced it would delay the filing of its earnings report for fiscal year 2018 to examine its accounting practices for 2018 and for previously reported years ranging from 2014 through 2017. On this news, American Renal\u2019s shares fell over 16%. Less than a month later, American Renal announced the resignation of its CFO, and the need to restate its financial results for fiscal years 2014 through 2017. The investigation has yet to be finalized. On this news, American Renal\u2019s shares fell almost 40% to close at $6.01 on March 28, 2019.\nAmerican Renal Associates Shareholders Have Legal Options\nConcerned shareholders who would like more information about their rights and potential remedies can contact attorney Leo Kandinov at (800) 350-6003, LKandinov@robbinsarroyo.com , or via the shareholder information form on the firm's website.\nRobbins Arroyo LLP is a nationally recognized leader in shareholder rights law. The firm represents individual and institutional investors in shareholder derivative and securities class action lawsuits, and has helped its clients realize more than $1 billion of value for themselves and the companies in which they have invested.\nAttorney Advertising.

            "title": "3 Tech Stocks That Pay Juicier Dividends Than Apple -- The Motley Fool",
            "text": "3 Tech Stocks That Pay Juicier Dividends Than Apple Published April 01, 2019 Markets Motley Fool\n Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) started up its current dividend program back in 2012 after years of refusing to give back even a single cent to its shareholders. Since then, the company has dutifully allocated a meaningful portion of its free cash flow to its dividend program and has raised its dividend payouts per share each year.\nWhile Apple is committed to its dividend program, the reality is that Apple isn&apos;t the highest-yielding stock out there. As of this writing, the company&apos;s dividend yield stands at 1.54%. That&apos;s a nontrivial amount, certainly, and the company is sure to raise it when it updates investors on its capital return program next month, but it&apos;s far from the most impressive yield that you can find in the world of tech stocks these days.\nTo that end, here are three tech stocks that offer more generous dividend yields than Apple does: Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN), and Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO).\n1. Broadcom Broadcom is a company that generates a gigantic -- and growing -- amount of free cash flow. The company has historically been focused on semiconductors (also more colloquially referred to as chips), but recently, it has been building up a large and highly profitable infrastructure software business, too, using its acquisitions of Brocade and CA Technologies as the foundation of that business.\nWhat income-oriented investors need to know, though, is that Broadcom allocates about half of its previous year&apos;s free cash flow to its dividend. Broadcom just raised its dividend to $10.60 per share -- a dividend yield of about 3.54% as of writing -- after turning in about $8.2 billion in free cash flow during its fiscal year 2018. The company is forecasting free cash flow of about $10 billion for the current fiscal year, suggesting that as long as the company&apos;s forecast is roughly accurate, shareholders should be in for yet another solid dividend bump later in this calendar year.\n2. Texas Instruments Advertisement\nAnother chip company that&apos;s very committed to its capital return program is Texas Instruments. The company&apos;s policy is to return all of its free cash flow to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. This strategy is something of a virtuous cycle -- as the company repurchases shares, reducing its overall share count, its free cash flow per share for a given level of free cash flow rises. On top of that, Texas Instruments is a good business that has seen its free cash flow trend generally up over the years, which has helped to fuel regular dividend boosts.\nToday, Texas Instruments&apos; shares offer a dividend yield of 2.9%, which is not only respectable on its own, but it&apos;s significantly greater than what Apple stock offers.\n3. Cisco Another tech company whose shares offer a larger dividend yield than Apple&apos;s do is networking technology giant Cisco Systems. Cisco is another company that generates a large amount of free cash flow and isn&apos;t shy about distributing the wealth to its shareholders. Its dividend yield as of writing stands at 2.59%.\nOver the last decade or so, Cisco&apos;s free cash flow has trended up and, along with it, so has the dividend.\nCisco isn&apos;t the fastest-growing company on the planet, but it is a growing business, with analysts expecting the company to grow its revenue by 4.8% in 2019 followed by another 3.4% rise in 2020. Analysts also predict that Cisco&apos;s earnings per share (EPS) is on track to rise nearly 18.1% in 2019, followed by another 9.7% boost in 2020. Given that Cisco&apos;s business seems to be moving in the right direction, I think shareholders should be able to safely count on dividend increases in the years ahead.\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom Ltd When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has quadrupled the market.*\nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Broadcom Ltd wasn&apos;t one of them!

Though it didn't come close to replacing your laptop, it had a 9.7-inch, 768-pixel resolution display and A4 processor. Despite the criticism, many lined up to buy the iPad, and after 80 days, Apple sold 3 million units . Updated: Caption: Lynn La Photo: Josh Miller/CNET 16 $269.99 at Walmart Read Full Review Apple iPhone 4 (2011)\nThe iPhone 4 sported one of the more distinct design updates from Apple and was the first iPhone to feature a Retina Display (meaning it had a 960x640-pixel resolution compared to the 800x480 display on Samsung's flagship at the time, the Galaxy S ). When Jobs introduced the phone to audiences, he also conducted the first public FaceTime call.

With a classic, well-constructed design, it's the company's first wearable device. Updated: Caption: Lynn La Photo: Sarah Tew/CNET 18 $139.95 at Walmart Read Full Review Apple iPhone X (2017)\nThe iPhone X dumped the home button and replaced it with gestures. It dumped the fingerprint scanner and replaced it with facial recognition.

            "text": "Spine Injury Solutions, Inc. ( OTCQB:SPIN ) Q4 2018 Results Earnings 4:00 PM ET\nCompany Participants\nAndrew Barwicki - Investor Relations\nWilliam Donovan - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nJohn Bergeron - Chief Financial Officer\n[Call Starts Abruptly] your coordinator and moderator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. Thank you for joining us on the Spine Injury Solutions conference call and interactive webcast to discuss the financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nOn the call with me today are Dr. William Donovan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Bergeron, Chief Financial Officer. Dr. Donovan will provide an update on the company's highlights and key activities for fiscal 2018. And Mr. Bergeron will then review the financial results for the year. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions.\nThis morning, Spine Injury Solutions issued its earnings press release and this afternoon filed its annual report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All of our public filings can be viewed on the SEC website at sec.gov, or on the Spine Injury Solutions' website, which is www.spineinjurysolutions.com.\nDuring the course of this conference call management may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or financial performance of the company within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions made by management regarding future circumstances over which the company may have little or no control that involve risks and uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements.\nWe refer you to the company's Form 10-K and other recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the description of these and other risk factors.\nAnd now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill to begin the discussion.\nWilliam Donovan\nThank you, Andrew, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our 2018 fiscal year end conference call. Today, I'm going to review our business operations, including discussions regarding our affiliate programs, Quad Video HALO, and our plans moving forward.\nWe believe the Quad Video HALO has potential on a global scale. We recognize the capital needs for Quad Video HALO to be successful. This said, we are speaking with funding sources from financiers, investors and potential partners, including potential acquirers to either fund the Quad Video HALO, license, or acquire the technology.\nThroughout 2017 and 2018, we've had many discussions with doctors and affiliates. And the end result has always been the same; the Quad Video HALOsystem does the job it was intended for. That being said, we believe the way medical procedures and the healthcare system in general is changing, the Quad Video HALO meets many criteria and there is value there. These values can only be recognized by having the proper funding and people dedicate to sales and marketing.\nWith respect to the overall operations, as you have may read in the 10-K or the press release this morning, our 2018 revenues were flat as compared to 2017. A major reason for the flat revenues is attributed to our capital resources. Our limit to access the proper funding has been a major obstacle for our growth.\nThroughout the company history, we have been able to grow successively through our bank line and collections. However, the cost of doing business and gross profit margins have been negatively impacted.\nI've also been asked to talk a little about brain testing. Over the past 40 years, I've treated thousands of patients with whiplash injuries, resulting from motor vehicle accidents. The physical signs and symptoms with whiplash injuries are similar to traumatic brain injuries, that I have identified some importance findings with TBI that we can focus on by the newer use of some technology. As you know, concussions and TBI have generated a lot of attention since the NFL settlements.\nWe are seeing a lot of potential TBIs with whiplash injuries, secondary to auto accident. As an example, if the airbags deploy in an accident, there's an 80% plus chance that the patient has had a TBI and it's from the blast forces. Based on new literature, they feel the blast forces are what's causing the TBI. This is no different than the IED bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nWe are working on developing screening procedures to identify which of these whiplash cases have an associated TBI and we're using VNG testing, various types of neurocognitive testing, various types of balanced testing, and now we're adding in some newer neurocognitive testing for malingering prior to any referrals to a neurologist or an neuropsych doctor.\nIf the testing is positive and we have positive documentation with neurologist and neuropsych evals, we then need to set up SPECT scans and DTI imaging studies. These are two different types of imaging studies that give a picture of the brain itself. Obviously, then that leads us into programs for cognitive testing in rehab, vestibular testing in rehab and we're now starting to explore exercise with oxygen, especially with the vestibular rehab.\nI want to now turn over this program to John Bergeron, our CFO.\nJohn Bergeron\nThank you, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. I will now review results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Revenue for fiscal year 2018 were $1.835 million, compared to $1.855 million in 2017. The decrease in revenues was primarily attributed to the lack of cash flow, which forced us to curtail our funding of cases in the fourth quarter.\nNet loss for fiscal year 2018 was $671,000, as compared to a net loss of $405,000 for fiscal year 2017. The increase in the company's net loss is due to a higher mix of cost of sales, an increase in bad debt expense, higher interest costs and investor relations expenses coupled with lower travel and payroll expenses. It should be noted that we collected over $92,000 in accounts receivable that we had previously written off. These collections are offset against bad debt expense. In 2018, we had $1.8 million in collections, compared to $1.78 million in 2017.\nFinally, our total debt in 2018 went up a $105,000 from prior year. The Wells Fargo line of credit still has a 185,000 in capacity to borrow on December 31st. We did pay down a $135,000 in debt on other notes to shareholders.\nWe reserved a large amount for doubtful accounts based on the aging of AR in the fourth quarter. As a general rule, the older the account, less likely to collect. However, please know we collect accounts there are over 5 years old every quarter. We also took a $50,000 charge on our QVH inventory due to obsolescence issues. We also retired some fixed assets off our books that were fully depreciated. So of the $671,000, we had $603,000 of it was non-cash charges.\nFinally, we tested for impairment on our goodwill figure, but found that the discounted cash flow from our current customers exceeds the total on our goodwill, so there will be no impairment recorded.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to -- back to Bill.\nWilliam Donovan\nWell. Thank you, John. Before we move on to question-and-answer session, I would like to discuss some of our options and plans we have. First and foremost, we believe the Quad Video HALO has potential.\nHaving said that, the potential will only be recognized if it is properly funded with a proper sales and marketing budget, and team. As such, we are exploring financing options and the possibility of selling the technology. Although, this is not an easy decision, we believe it is in the best interest to Spine Injury Solutions and shareholders. With our current financial situation and limited capital, we acknowledge that we cannot implement a sales and marketing plan to expand the QVH.\nOur core business has a proven business model. However, with the limited capital, that business too faces challenges. We believe our collections will continue successfully and allow us to operate the company. We are actively seeking funding options that will allow us to grow. We are working with a few bankers and brokers to assist us in capital raises and financing options.\nThank you for your interest and time today. Andrew, we're now ready to take questions.\nA - Andrew Barwicki\nThank you, Dr. Donovan. At this time, I would like to remind people that you are welcome to enter your questions on the webinar. We did receive eight questions via voice and email, which I will start with those. But in the meantime, feel free -- to all participants on the webinar, feel free to answer your questions and we will read them aloud. The first question came from [Bryan Peluso]. The question is as follows;\nWith little to no revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018, what is the company going to do for the rest of 2019?\nJohn Bergeron\nWell, we have $2.9 million in net accounts receivable, so we can continue to operate the company. That will allow us to seek alternative financing options. With respect to 2019, we are exploring a number of different options for financing.\nAndrew Barwicki\nThank you. The second question comes from [Grant Albores]. The question is, is the company trying to raise money or increase the current credit bank line? And if they don't get any more money in, what will the company do for its future?\nJohn Bergeron\nJust like I said a minute ago, Grant, we're meeting with and discussing various financing options to grow Spine Injury Solutions. With respect to the credit line, we prefer that the credit line be paid off rather than tapping it further, we're requesting a credit line increase.\nAndrew Barwicki\nThank you. Second question comes from [Grant Albores] as well to follow-up question. What are the -- what is the explanation for 2018 revenues and bottom-line loss?\nJohn Bergeron\nFunding, our primary issue in the fourth quarter was having the capital to go out and fund additional settlements. We also focused some of our time on VNG testing. It has a higher return, better margins and we believe a better investment opportunity which will provide return on investment to shareholders. Like I said earlier, of the $671,000 loss, $603,000 of it is non-cash.\nAndrew Barwicki\nOkay, thank you. The next question comes from [Jeffrey McPherson]. Has the company laid off employees and is management still taking their salaries?\nWilliam Donovan\nJeff, at this time, we do not see a reason to let people go. We have been working with a minimal work first for many years and we'll continue to do so. We also believe based on the potential in VNG testing and other tests, that we have many opportunities to grow and that will require the appropriate staff. At the request of the Board of Directors, I stopped taking the salary in Q1 last month.\nAndrew Barwicki\nThank you. The next question is from [Mark B]. Can Spine Injury Solutions be sold to a larger company?\nJohn Bergeron\nYes, there's always the possibility of a merger or acquisition. At this time, we don't have anything to announce. But I can assure you that we're exploring all our options.\nAndrew Barwicki\nThank you. Next question comes from [George Anders]. Is it with Spine being in business any longer, what happens to all the money that is owed to Spine Injuries Solutions from all those legal cases you have?\nJohn Bergeron\nOkay, we do expect to be in business because we do have to collect on those accounts receivable on our balance sheet. Those receivables belong to the company and we intend to collect on them. As we said earlier, that we will use those to operate the company while we seek additional funding.\nAndrew Barwicki\nThank you. Next question also comes from [George Anders]. Why does management not have employment contracts in place?\nJohn Bergeron\nI'll take that one too. Both Bill and I are committed to this company. We don't have an agreement in place to interfere with any potential deals. For example, if a company were to come in and consider acquiring us, we did not want employment agreements to interfere additionally, or may add back to the balance sheet in the event that we can't make payroll. Having said that, if we have to go for -- if we have to forego pay cheques we'd rather not burden the balance sheet. As a management I want to focus on company growth, not my personal salary.\nAndrew Barwicki\nThank you. The next question comes from [Bill Gracie]. Can anything be done to collect the current accounts receivables quicker than has been done in the past?\nWilliam Donovan\nBill let me take that. We do have a good system in place that includes prompt timing regarding collections. We have always looked to improve. But from an overall standpoint, we cannot expect better than the normal timeframes. It became apparent that many of our cases are going to trial because of the size of the case and the location of the venue and this delay settlements by months and sometimes two to three years.\nAndrew Barwicki\nThank you. The next question is from -- my apologies, if I say this one, [Josh Einiger or AXA]. There are two things here. First, if your core business model would really work, you wouldn't have such funds to raise some capital for in my opinion. Second thing is that we have been led to believe that 99% of the money would get collected and now we have $530,000 in bad debt, doesn't fit somehow. Please elaborate.\nJohn Bergeron\nI'm not sure where you got your number of 90%. It's collecting. Also remember that a bad debt expense is just as an estimate, that's what it is. It's just an estimate. I don't know if these accounts will be received or not. For accounting purposes and make the auditors happy, I've reserved one.\nI'm just not sure about your number where you came up with that.\nWilliam Donovan\nWell, I think what he's referring to is the failure rate of 10%, which means you're collecting something on at least 90%. That's true. And if you have just smaller cases, those turn over much quicker. As you get on to the larger cases with multiple procedures, and if they end up going to court, you maintain a 90% collecting something on the case but it gets delayed. And that\u2019s where you run out of money because of the delay in the settlements. We expect to collect on the settlements to have the company continue operation. But we have to be very, very careful about funding, new accounts receivable that we know, if it's a big case, it may take three or four years to settle. So this is an issue that we have to deal with on every case where we have an opportunity to fund the accounts receivable.\nAndrew Barwicki\nThank you. The next question is from [William Ryan]. You're focusing on VNG testing. What exactly does that focus mean and specific, how do you intent to turn that focus into a profit?\nWilliam Donovan\nBill, I appreciate the question. As you know, when you are in practice, the number of whiplash injuries is unbelievable. All of these years I now realize that many doctors like you and me were missing TBI symptoms and cases. I feel there's a large opportunity here because as you and I know there's a large number of whiplash injuries. And it's been shocking to me when we do our battery of tests what has been showing up, and it will require a proper set up and a proper system. But in these cases, we would not be a funding mechanism. Spine Pain is not large enough to continue as a funding company. However, we can put programs together and at the testing completed that would help the patients and the doctors.\nAndrew Barwicki\nThank you. Follow up question from [Josh Einiger or AXA], again my apologies if I said his name incorrectly. Question is, the company's put so much money into acquiring Video HALO, and now it seems like nobody wants it, despite that we were told to believe that it can sell on its own. Can you please comment on Quad Video HALO sales?\nWilliam Donovan\nI think that what we have learned Josh, Quad Video HALO is ideal for teaching hospitals. I started using it, when it was developed because I was at the beta test site. And it worked wonders in my practice. I have been surprised that other doctors didn't experience the same issues. However, I think with changes in healthcare, there's significant opportunities in education and documentation of procedures.\nAndrew Barwicki\nThank you. Next question comes from Frank. The Spine Injury Solutions over the years was a successful company with increased revenues and bottom-line profits. It would seem to me as if the business [Audio Gap] \u2026\nWilliam Donovan\nHello. We lost you.\nAndrew Barwicki\n\u2026. back to numbers from 2012 or 2013.\nWilliam Donovan\nCould you repeat the question? We lost you, there was an interrupt. Hello?\nAndrew Barwicki\nYes, my apologies. This question comes from Frank. The question is, the company was -- Spine Injury Solutions was a successful company for many years. Revenues were increasing and profits were there. What does the company has to do to get back to those numbers and is there something that the company can do to get back to that level?\nJohn Bergeron\nWell, I think the first thing is we have to raise additional funds. We can't operate without them. And again, we are investigating every possible investment -- investor that comes forward. Nothing -- everything will be considered. That's probably the biggest things. We just need the money.\nAndrew Barwicki\nOkay. At this time, there are no further questions. We've answered all the questions that were submitted via email, voicemail and online here at the webinar. I thank everybody for joining and participating in the conference call. And we look forward to speaking with you in the future. Thank you, everybody, and you may disconnect at this time.",

( OTC:PRKR ) Q4 2018 Results Earnings 1, 2019 4:30 PM\nChristopher Chu - The Piacente Group\nCindy Poehlman - Chief Financial Officer\nJeffrey Parker - Chief Executive Officer\nOperator\nGood day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the ParkerVision Fourth Quarter 2018 Conference Call and Webcast.\nAt this time, it's my pleasure to turn the floor over to Christopher Chu. Sir, the floor is yours.\nChristopher Chu\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this conference call will contain , which involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties about our business and the economy as well as other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected achievements and anticipated results. Included in these risks are the Company's ability to maintain technological advances in the marketplace, the ability to secure new customers for our products and technologies, maintaining our patent protection and the outcome of litigation, among others. Given these uncertainties as well as other factors related to our business, we caution you to not place undue reliance on any contained in this conference call. Additional information concerning these and other risks can be found in our periodic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nOn today's call, we will hear from Cindy Poehlman, Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a review of the Company's financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018. Following Cindy's remarks, Jeffrey Parker, Chief Executive Officer, will provide an update on the Company's business.\nThank you again for joining us. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Cindy. Please go ahead.\nCindy Poehlman\nThank you, Chris, and good afternoon to those of you joining us for ParkerVision's fourth quarter and year end 2018 conference call. We reported today a net loss of $7.2 million or $0.27 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $6.3 million or $0.32 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017. Our net loss for the fourth quarter is heavily impacted by a $4.6 million loss related to the increase in the fair value of our contingent payment obligation for the quarter.\nIf you take a look at our non-GAAP net loss which excludes this change in fair value and also excludes share based compensation, you'll see a very different picture. Our non-GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $2.5 million or $0.09 per share, which reflects a 50% decrease from the non-GAAP net loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $5 million or $0.26 per share.\nOur fourth quarter operating expenses were approximately $3 million or 55% lower than operating expenses for the same period in 2017. That decrease is reflective largely of our restructuring efforts in the latter part of 2018, along with some decreases in litigation expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 2017. On a year-to-date basis, our net loss for 2018 was $20.9 million or $0.85 per share compared to $19.3 million or $1.09 per share in 2017. Non-GAAP net loss was $14.2 million or $0.58 per share for 2018 and $16.4 million or $0.93 per share for 2017.\nThe results for 2018 include approximately $1.8 million in non-recurring, restructuring and inventory impairment charges, most of which were incurred in the third quarter of 2018, which we discussed on our last call. Liquidity continues to be an area of focus for the Company. During 2018, we used proceeds from both debt and equity transactions to fund our operations. We used cash for operations of $10.3 million in 2018, compared to $14.1 million in 2017.\nIn the fourth quarter, our cash used for operations decreased by 60% to $1.2 million compared to $3 million for the same quarter last year. We are continuing our efforts to further reduce our operating expenses in 2019 as well as exploring opportunities to properly finance our future operations.\nWith that, I'm going to turn the call over to Jeff, for a brief business update, but I'm available to answer any questions you may have at the end of the call today. Jeff?\nJeffrey Parker\nThank you, Cindy, and good afternoon. Thanks to those of you who are attending our update call today. My comment is going to be pretty brief as it seems to be that the norm with patent litigation these days is an exercise and hurry up and wait. But let's review kind of where we are in the various enforcement actions that represent our intellectual property program today.\nCurrently we're waiting on the next steps for two different actions that we have underway in the middle district of Florida; one in the Federal Court in Jacksonville, and the other in Federal Court in Orlando. We also have an action which we believe is near to its conclusion in Munich, Germany.\nSo, starting with the Jacksonville District Court, we expect a ruling on our Markman, which addresses claim construction anytime now. The court indicated that the Markman hearing itself that was held the end of August of last year, that a ruling would occur in short order. However, that didn't come with a date certain, so we can only hope that this will happen anytime now.\nIn the Orlando District Court case, the stay that was placed on that case after IPR's were filed was officially listed in January of this year, and the court has now received the proposals from both parties for key dates that lead up to trial, as well as guidance on which patents and claims we proposed to take forward to the trial. This court's been responsive after the IPR challenges in this case were resolved and asked us quickly after the IPR resolution if we were ready to move forward. So hopefully we will see guidance on the latest proposals we submitted very shortly.\nOn the Munich, Germany case, we attended what we believe was the final hearing a couple of weeks ago in Munich, in mid March. The purpose of this hearing was very technical in nature. A court appointed expert attended the two-day hearing as a guide to the court on the differences that exists between ParkerVision's guidance and Apple's guidance on highly technical issues around the invention itself and its use in Apple products. One of the ground rules is that the expert can have no correspondence outside of the public hearing with any of the parties even including with the court. The expert's role was to answer questions from both parties as well as the court, and to provide guidance on highly technical matters.\nCandidly, I wish we would have more time as there wasn't enough time even in the two days for all the topics. However, keep in mind that the use of a technical expert for this court is unusual and normally the court doesn't depend on having an expert to help sort through these types of topics and gets to decisions without the use of a court appointed expert.\nOverall my view on this case is that the patent we asserted clearly covers energy sampling and not prior our voltage sampling as the defendant has stated. The claim itself in fact never even one-time uses the word \"Voltage\". On infringement, we provided very detailed guidance in our briefs on exactly how the infringing products practice the claims in a step-by-step proof.\nThe expert himself stated at the onset of the hearing that it was his opinion that this type of down converting circuit was not known at the time of the filing of this patent. But that today it is widely deployed and commonly understood. Counsel has currently guided us that their expectation is that there will be a ruling some time in April. And so for now, we will await the court's decision.\nAnd that's really the update that we have on the three actions that are currently underway; Jacksonville, which is involving Qualcomm and Apple; Orlando, which involves Qualcomm and HTC; and Germany, which involves Apple and Intel.\nSo, for now, I'd like to open this call up for any questions you may have.\nThank you, sir. Mr. Parker, there doesn't appear to be any questions at this time.\nJeffrey Parker\nOkay. Well, listen folks, thanks for joining us for today's update. And I hope that in the very near future we can bring you good news from one or maybe all of the actions that are currently underway. Hope you have a great week. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time, and have a great day.",

The path has been slow and arduous. Like most things Apple, the grand vision and execution unfolded on the company\u2019s own schedule and not on any predetermined timeline. Apple sometimes leads, sometimes follows, but often invents a whole new category.\nAt its event last Monday, Apple unveiled a no-fee, cash-back credit card available in the United States in partnership with Goldman Sachs, that comes with an Apple-branded titanium card. Chief executive Tim Cook called the move \u201cthe most significant change in the credit-card experience in 50 years.\u201d\nStory continues below advertisement\nThe Apple Card embedded and enabled on the iPhone is a game changer. Why? Apple will retain full data rights within its ecosystem (albeit used and processed within devices rather than Apple servers). This means Apple and its partners can offer financial products right on the iPhone. Apple Card will have immediate and deep financial connectivity and it will be able to see everyday purchases in real time, while populating a rewards card in real time. So where is this going?\nAt Framework Venture Partners, we believe that the future of finance will be shaped by what we\u2019ve labelled Fintech 2.0. Simply put, our thesis is that standalone financial products and services will largely disappear and will instead become embedded in the flow of applications people use every day. The value won\u2019t just be from this integration, but rather from the way in which artificial intelligence will enable purchases, savings and lending to be managed and delivered in an optimal and intuitive way.\nCombining real-world attributes with digital footprints into a seamless product will change the face of banking and ultimately the experience of businesses and consumers. Imagine for a moment that the Apple Card is used for all of a person\u2019s daily transactions. After some relatively short period of time, say 12 to 24 months, Apple will be able to tell with a high percentage of accuracy what a person\u2019s income, financial and personal situation looks like on an intimate level.\nThis itemized visibility will mean that Apple is likely to forecast when you get married, have children or will be looking to make a major purchases. With all this data, Apple could then offer this person real-time money movements, savings, investments and even mortgages with virtually no paperwork. More importantly, Apple could offer these products with preapproved amounts and rates customized to that person\u2019s projected credit risk.\nWhile this seems scary to some, to millennials who are struggling with personal financial literacy, this may be the solution they were looking for. Only 24 per cent of today\u2019s millennials demonstrated basic financial knowledge, according to a study in the United States by PwC. The need for help has become a chronic societal issue.\nEnter Apple: Getting advice in real time on how to save, how to spend and finding solutions for this in real time is the future. Our belief is that within 10 years, Apple Card will migrate into Apple Finance. This shift will direct you where to buy your next pair of shoes at the best price within your budget. Apple will be able to take your excess savings and provide products optimized for your personal situation. Ultimately, placing cash within the Apple supply chain could displace Wall Street\u2019s savings accounts, investment funds and much more.\nWhile the timing of all of this is difficult to predict, what isn\u2019t difficult to guess is that Apple won\u2019t stop with Apple Card. The future of fintech is clearly on the smartphone and within software, not inside a branch and mainframes.\nStory continues below advertisement\nRelated",

            "title": "Apple (AAPL) Stock Outlook: Q2 Earnings, iPhone Sales & Services Growth",
            "text": "Shutterstock photo\nShares of Apple AAPL have climbed over 20% this year, along with FAANG peers Netflix NFLX and Facebook FB , to outpace the S&P 500's 13% jump. Apple and CEO Tim Cook hope that new Services like Apple TV+ will propel long-term growth for the tech titan. But despite its new offerings and its 2019 climb, Apple's near-term outlook appears rough, especially in terms of iPhone sales.\nRecent News & Overview\nApple just recently lowered the price of many of its products, including iPhones, iPads, Macs, and AirPods, on its online store in China, according to multiple reports. Prices on these products were lowered by roughly 6% on average and come after official Chinese third-party Apple sellers such as Alibaba's BABA Tmall and JD.com JD lowered some Apple prices earlier this year. Apple's new price cuts have been attributed to the recent reduction of a value-added tax in China from 16% to 13%.\nIt is unclear if Apple's lower prices will positively impact sales in the market that has for years offered a range of much less expensive smartphones from the likes of Xiaomi and Huawei. Investors might remember that Apple stock plummeted at the start of the year after Cook warned shareholders of a major slowdown in China and lower-than-anticipated iPhone sales.\nAAPL's first-quarter revenue ended up falling 4.5%, driven by a 15% drop off in iPhone sales and a 27% decline in revenue in Greater China. The world's second-largest economy, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, accounted for roughly 16% of quarterly sales, while iPhone sales were responsible for 61% of Q1 revenue.\nSince the disappointing quarter, Apple has focused on its Services future. The company last week unveiled its long-awaited streaming TV platform that hopes to one day compete alongside Amazon AMZN Prime, Netflix, Hulu, and Disney's DIS soon-to-launched streaming service. Apple also showed off its $9.99 per month, magazine-heavy news service, a new Apple credit card in partnership with Goldman Sachs GS , and a subscription-based gaming offering called Apple Arcade.\nOutlook\nApple's Services business has been closely watched by Wall Street for years, but the unit that includes Spotify SPOT competitor, Apple Music and more, will face even more scrutiny going forward. But before we look at what to expect from Services, let's see how Apple's biggest units are projected to perform this quarter.\nOverall, Apple's adjusted second-quarter earnings are projected to sink 13.2% on the back of a 5.8% decrease in quarterly revenue. Peeking further ahead, Apple's full-year 2019 revenue is expected to dip 4.1%, with its adjusted EPS figure projected to fall at a similar rate.\nMore specially, Q2 iPhone revenue is projected to tumble roughly 19.5% from $38.03 billion in the year-ago period to $30.57 billion, based on our current NFM estimate. This would mark a larger year over year decline in Apple's most important business than Q1. Meanwhile, Apple's Services unit is projected to jump nearly 23% from $9.19 billion to reach $11.29 billion. Investors will likely be pleased to note that this estimate comes in above Q1's 20% Services growth.\nBottom Line\nAs we mentioned at the top, shares of Apple have climbed over 20% this year. With that said, AAPL stock still rests 18% below its 52-week high of $233.47 per share. This gives the stock more room to run heading into its second-quarter earnings release, which is expected in early May.\nApple is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) based on its mixed earnings estimate revision activity. The company clearly faces a substantial downturn ahead. But if investors and Wall Street know to expect lower iPhone sales and top and bottom-line declines, there might be a better chance that Services growth can help propel the stock forward.\nApple's overall near-term outlook could be hard for some to swallow, but the iPhone market is still one of the world's largest companies. Therefore, along with its massive pile of cash, its quarterly dividend, and industry-matching valuation, Apple stock might be worth buying or holding onto.\nZacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2019\nIn addition to the stocks discussed above, wouldn't you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-holds for the year?\nFrom more than 4,000 companies covered by the Zacks Rank, these 10 were picked by a process that consistently beats the market. Even during 2018 while the market dropped -5.2%, our Top 10s were up well into double-digits. And during bullish 2012 - 2017, they soared far above the market's +126.3%, reaching +181.9%.\nThis year, the portfolio features a player that thrives on volatility, an AI comer, and a dynamic tech company that helps doctors deliver better patient outcomes at lower costs.\nSee Stocks Today >>\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "text": "New people are being targeted for Amex Platinum 100K \u2013 Check now! Dear Apple Fans: You Can Do Better Than The Apple Credit Card\nWe covered the news about the upcoming launch of the new Apple credit card a little while ago. My first impression was so what? This thing is a dog with fleas. Maybe calling it junk is going too far but I bet 10\u2019s of millions of people will get the card even though they could do better. And there probably won\u2019t even be a welcome offer on the card. Why I Don\u2019t Like It\nThe card will earn the following rates: 2% when using Apple Pay 3% on Apple purchases 1% back on everything else\nBlah\u2026those are pretty paltry. You can easily earn 2% on everyday purchases with or without Apple Pay. And unless you are buying an Apple computer every few months or accessories often you won\u2019t use the 3% back much. And in app purchases, who wants 3% when you can get 15% off those purchases pretty much all the time , plus 2% or more from your credit card on top of that.\nEven if you are purchasing Apple products you can do better using a business card that earns 5X when purchasing it from the cell provider . And Apple computers are for sale everywhere. You can even stack portals, rewards points , and better earning rates when you purchase them outside of Apple. What About Their Other Claims?\nDon\u2019t get me wrong instant rewards sound pretty cool. But it isn\u2019t anything new really. The Barclay Arrival+ card has had you earning points as soon as your charge posts for years now. The redemption is more restrictive but it is about the same thing.\nWho cares if the card is \u201cdigital\u201d if you can add any card to virtual wallets as it is. I don\u2019t see the \u201chype\u201d there.\nUsing your card right after approval, as if we need to get less than optimal rates right away. But even if that were the case American Express and some other banks will give you a virtual credit card number right away for online purchases. Trust me, better earnings are worth the wait anyway.\nSecurity they say? Hasn\u2019t like every famous person\u2019s iPhone or cloud been hacked and had their photos leaked? I laugh every time I see those Apple security commercials.\nUnless this thing comes with a free Apple Watch or an iPhone I don\u2019t see the attraction. Then Why Will It Be Popular?\nThen why will it be popular, because it is Apple. People will pay more for similar performance, or even worse performance, just because it has an Apple logo on it. People also like to keep everything in one family. They become loyal to a brand that won\u2019t be loyal to them in return . Overall most people are sheep and will go where everyone else will go. That leads to a ton of consumers using inferior products. But the card is Titanium! They can now feel good when they rip it out of their wallet instead of using their cracked iPhone screen to pay for their coffee I guess.\nDon\u2019t be a part of the flock, demand better ! Just so you don\u2019t think I am a Apple hater or Android lover etc. I do own an iPhone :). TAGS ",

            "text": "Now that we have entered the second calendar quarter of 2019, investors are looking toward earnings season in a couple of weeks. One of the biggest questions will surround China, as the country has not come to an official trade agreement with the United States just yet. Perhaps the biggest name that has been impacted by this has been technology giant Apple ( AAPL ). The company issued a large revenue warning for its important holiday quarter thanks to weakness in China surrounding iPhone sales, so investors are wondering how quickly the company's second-most-important market can turn.\nOn Monday, it certainly appears that Apple made a move to boost sales. According to multiple reports, the company cut prices on its official China website by as much as 6% for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and AirPods. As CNBC details in this article , the price of the entry-level iPhone XR was lowered by 300RMB to 6,199RMB. The higher-end models of the iPhone saw their prices go down by 500RMB each.\nEarlier this year, consumers in China saw prices cut on official Apple third-party sellers like TMall and JD.com (NASDAQ: JD ). Monday's news comes on the heels of a value-added tax cut in China for manufacturers from 16% to 13%. However, investors also should realize that the US dollar has weakened a bit against the renminbi during the first calendar quarter of Q1 as seen below. The dollar has lost about 2% since the iPhone XR/XS line was announced, and a little more than that from the yearly-high.\n( Source: cnbc.com)\nInterestingly enough, the CNBC article says that anyone who purchased a device in the last 14 days whose price was reduced can receive a refund for the difference. That would imply that Apple management knows its overall revenues for the quarter are decent, because otherwise I don't think they'd potentially refund tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars. This also will mean a slight margin hit for the fiscal second quarter.\nThe big question now is how soon can Apple return to revenue growth in the Greater China region? As the chart below shows, the December period was the worst percentage change in Apple revenues there in the past nine quarters, a decline of almost 26.7%. I don't think anyone is expecting to see growth in the March ending period, but investors and analysts are hopeful that there will be some sequential improvement (not as large a decline).\n( Source: Apple financial information page, seen here )\nAs we look toward earnings season coming in a hurry, Apple made a move Monday to cut prices on its main site in China. While the US trade war has not officially ended, a cut to the value-added tax and weakness in the dollar likely helped Apple pass these savings on to consumers. While it likely will be some time before the company returns to growth in its second-most-important market, management is certainly trying to boost sales in the region. Apple shares are definitely pricing in some good news moving forward, as the stock has recently regained the $190 level for the first time since November.\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.\nAdditional disclosure: Author\u2019s additional disclosure: Investors are always reminded that before making any investment, you should do your own proper due diligence on any name directly or indirectly mentioned in this article.

            "title": "Polaris Industries: Ready To Rally - Polaris Industries Inc. (NYSE:PII)",
            "text": "Welcome, reader. In this article, we are going to review the state of Polaris Industries, Inc. (NYSE: PII ) as they are today, following the company's rapid expansion from $1.6B annual sales to their most recent report's $6B sales (Polaris Industries' FY2008 10-K , FY2018 10-K ). Growth has come primarily through acquisition and expansion into the Australian market.\nAfter reviewing the company's financial results, which I outline below, I have to say the company appears to be in good shape. I am bullish Polaris Industries stock as I believe their operating earnings and business position are being undervalued at $84.43.\nPolaris Industries': Activity From The C-Suite The growth through acquisition since 2008 has transformed the state of this business: From carrying no long-term debt outside of their credit facility to issuance of a couple billion in debt of which $1.95B in long-term bonds remains outstanding. The company also operates on a more global scale, coming with the commensurate risks in foreign currency incomes such as from their expansion into Australia.\nReturning to favorable aspects of the business, reviewing the company's reports from both pre and post the great recession indicate a surprisingly resilient sales number. The company made a full 80-90% as many sales or better, taking out revenues acquired during the period, during the recessionary period as they did during the years 2004-2006 and maintained profitable operations to boot.\nThe robust profitability of those lines is a good sign the business will continue generating enough cash to protect shareholder value from negative economic events so long as they do not become much more leveraged. Continuing their streak of strong sales is important here because the company's growth in long-term debt will be a substantial weight on the bottom line until the bonds are retired.\nAll in all, because of the robustness of profits during downturns, so far, their acquisitive behavior is defensible for conservative investors.\nHow Threats To Polaris Have Increased Throughout This Period Of Rapid Growth Inventory turnover has slowed down considerably from typically exceeding 8 turns per year, which the company achieved over many years, to recent reports of a turn rate at 6.6. Adding more high-cost products such as with the company's recently closed acquisition of Boat Holdings, LLC for $805M is likely going to drag their inventory turnover lower.\nThe threat here is, while selling bigger and more expensive items for a healthy profit margin is great (and reduces the turnover number cited above), in the case of an economic slowdown, we're going to see worse performance from the business as credit for big purchases dries up. So, in the case of setbacks, the stock won't be able to avoid being depreciated due to earnings deterioration despite their history of robust earnings.\nPolaris' Top Tier Brands As a result of the Boat acquisition, the company now owns the boating names Bennington, Godfrey, Hurricane, and Rinker. Through this acquisition, Polaris has increased their exposure to the growing popularity of the pontoon boat.\nTheir ATV and Snowmobile businesses are each among, if not the biggest, players in their respective industries. And, the company's Indian Motorcycles brand is legendary among bikers. All in all, the branding picture is good, with Polaris owning top global brands in most of their lines of business.\nMoney Talks: I Am Bullish Polaris Industries Polaris cleared $251M of free cash flow available to owners for 2018 after making their typical volume of capital expenditures. Hence, the maximum dividend distribution they might be able to make at today's earnings, and stock price level attains to a theoretical dividend yield of 4.77%.\nCash from operations came in at $477M during the recent year, about $100M lower than their all-time high takes of 2016 and 2017. The stock is trading at a price to earnings ratio of 16.51x, a 27% discount to the broader market as measured by the S&P 500 and a more modest 9% discount to the DOW Industrials Index at a P/E of 16.99.\nI believe the DOW Industrials is a good comparison because of the large amount of manufacturing operations (reflected in that index's lower P/E). However, I believe Polaris deserves a premium to the DOW P/E because of their strong profit margins and industry-leading position.\nOdds are good we will see the company's cash from operations improve, in part because of the addition of more big-ticket items to their product mix via the Boat purchase. Big ticket durable products tend to generate a lot of cash upfront.\nThe figures are stacking up nicely, with a long track record of successful business operations, the company has built up substantial vertical integration in their product manufacturing process which helps them protect profit margins long term.\nMy take: Polaris is a solid pick for a long-term buy and hold from today's price.\nSupplementary Data: Data by YCharts\nIn the red line, we can see the Polaris has shrunk total shares outstanding by roughly 9% since 2015, making steady progress. Juxtaposed with their share price, it appears management has been chasing the stock price up on these purchases, which is unfavorable for long-term shareholders.\nThe company is in the first innings of its second decade as a leveraged corporate. At 33% debt to revenue, the company is soundly positioned, and as an investor, I'd like to see them accumulating cash while maintaining the dividend and deploying a small portion of cash to buy back stock below $100 per share.\nLove the message?
