Since then, the company has dutifully allocated a meaningful portion of its free cash flow to its dividend program and has raised its dividend payouts per share each year.\nWhile Apple is committed to its dividend program, the reality is that Apple isn't the highest-yielding stock out there. As of this writing, the company's dividend yield stands at 1.54%. That's a nontrivial amount, certainly, and the company is sure to raise it when it updates investors on its capital return program next month, but it's far from the most impressive yield that you can find in the world of tech stocks these days.\nOne person hands a dividend check to another. More Image source: Getty Images.\nTo that end, here are three tech stocks that offer more generous dividend yields than Apple does: Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) , and Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) .\n1. Broadcom Broadcom is a company that generates a gigantic -- and growing -- amount of free cash flow. The company has historically been focused on semiconductors (also more colloquially referred to as chips), but recently, it has been building up a large and highly profitable infrastructure software business, too, using its acquisitions of Brocade and CA Technologies as the foundation of that business.\nAVGO Free Cash Flow (TTM) Chart More AVGO Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts .\nWhat income-oriented investors need to know, though, is that Broadcom allocates about half of its previous year's free cash flow to its dividend. Broadcom just raised its dividend to $10.60 per share -- a dividend yield of about 3.54% as of writing -- after turning in about $8.2 billion in free cash flow during its fiscal year 2018. The company is forecasting free cash flow of about $10 billion for the current fiscal year, suggesting that as long as the company's forecast is roughly accurate, shareholders should be in for yet another solid dividend bump later in this calendar year.\n2. Texas Instruments Another chip company that's very committed to its capital return program is Texas Instruments. The company's policy is to return all of its free cash flow to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. This strategy is something of a virtuous cycle -- as the company repurchases shares, reducing its overall share count, its free cash flow per share for a given level of free cash flow rises. On top of that, Texas Instruments is a good business that has seen its free cash flow trend generally up over the years, which has helped to fuel regular dividend boosts.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://ycharts.com/companies/AVGO/free_cash_flow_ttm", "https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/free-cash-flow.aspx?utm_campaign=article&utm_medium=feed&referring_guid=eaa8a3c6-2437-4975-a6d5-4849bbdde9ae&utm_source=yahoo-host", "https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/dividend-yield.aspx?utm_campaign=article&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;referring_guid=eaa8a3c6-2437-4975-a6d5-4849bbdde9ae&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.XKxMiYNElxW2LP1ljdJyw--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/motleyfool.com/b9d1533061c1a5ebb61e5e12a788e5d4", "https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/free-cash-flow.aspx?utm_campaign=article&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;referring_guid=eaa8a3c6-2437-4975-a6d5-4849bbdde9ae&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host&quot;", "https://ycharts.com/companies/AVGO/chart/", "https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/dividend-yield.aspx?utm_campaign=article&utm_medium=feed&referring_guid=eaa8a3c6-2437-4975-a6d5-4849bbdde9ae&utm_source=yahoo-host", "https://ycharts.com", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.XKxMiYNElxW2LP1ljdJyw--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/motleyfool.com/b9d1533061c1a5ebb61e5e12a788e5d4);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nw1OUGdwiuHcSgWNQcBAHw--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/motleyfool.com/672db67e3009136958b5c14ade663402);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nw1OUGdwiuHcSgWNQcBAHw--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/motleyfool.com/672db67e3009136958b5c14ade663402", "https://ycharts.com/companies/AVGO/chart/&quot;", "https://ycharts.com/companies/AVGO/free_cash_flow_ttm&quot;", "https://ycharts.com&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "texas instruments", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "broadcom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "broadcom broadcom", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T02:41:12.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "07ae10eb057ae57c3c91fb5565026d8f6bc04071", "url": "https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-aapl-stock-outlook-q2-205608354.html", "site_full": "sg.finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/topic/technology", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo Finance - Business finance, stock market, quotes, news", "title": "Apple (AAPL) Stock Outlook: Q2 Earnings, iPhone Sales & Services Growth", "title_full": "Apple (AAPL) Stock Outlook: Q2 Earnings, iPhone Sales & Services Growth", "published": "2019-04-02T04:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uNWkU89lmjGeQn6YC98jmQ--~B/aD01OTY7dz05MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/ebe69840ed41531b93684c41c3b497a1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "07ae10eb057ae57c3c91fb5565026d8f6bc04071", "url": "https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-aapl-stock-outlook-q2-205608354.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Benjamin Rains", "published": "2019-04-02T04:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Apple (AAPL) Stock Outlook: Q2 Earnings, iPhone Sales & Services Growth", "text": "Shares of Apple AAPL have climbed over 20% this year, along with FAANG peers Netflix NFLX and Facebook FB, to outpace the S&P 500\u2019s 13% jump. Apple and CEO Tim Cook hope that new Services like Apple TV+ will propel long-term growth for the tech titan. But despite its new offerings and its 2019 climb, Apple\u2019s near-term outlook appears rough, especially in terms of iPhone sales.\nRecent News & Overview\nApple just recently lowered the price of many of its products, including iPhones, iPads, Macs, and AirPods, on its online store in China, according to multiple reports. Prices on these products were lowered by roughly 6% on average and come after official Chinese third-party Apple sellers such as Alibaba\u2019s BABA Tmall and JD.com JD lowered some Apple prices earlier this year. Apple\u2019s new price cuts have been attributed to the recent reduction of a value-added tax in China from 16% to 13%.\nIt is unclear if Apple\u2019s lower prices will positively impact sales in the market that has for years offered a range of much less expensive smartphones from the likes of Xiaomi and Huawei. Investors might remember that Apple stock plummeted at the start of the year after Cook warned shareholders of a major slowdown in China and lower-than-anticipated iPhone sales.\nAAPL\u2019s first-quarter revenue ended up falling 4.5%, driven by a 15% drop off in iPhone sales and a 27% decline in revenue in Greater China. The world\u2019s second-largest economy, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, accounted for roughly 16% of quarterly sales, while iPhone sales were responsible for 61% of Q1 revenue.\nSince the disappointing quarter, Apple has focused on its Services future. The company last week unveiled its long-awaited streaming TV platform that hopes to one day compete alongside Amazon AMZN Prime, Netflix, Hulu, and Disney\u2019s DIS soon-to-launched streaming service. Apple also showed off its $9.99 per month, magazine-heavy news service, a new Apple credit card in partnership with Goldman Sachs GS, and a subscription-based gaming offering called Apple Arcade.\nOutlook\nApple\u2019s Services business has been closely watched by Wall Street for years, but the unit that includes Spotify SPOT competitor, Apple Music and more, will face even more scrutiny going forward. But before we look at what to expect from Services, let\u2019s see how Apple\u2019s biggest units are projected to perform this quarter.\nOverall, Apple\u2019s adjusted second-quarter earnings are projected to sink 13.2% on the back of a 5.8% decrease in quarterly revenue. Peeking further ahead, Apple\u2019s full-year 2019 revenue is expected to dip 4.1%, with its adjusted EPS figure projected to fall at a similar rate.\nMore specially, Q2 iPhone revenue is projected to tumble roughly 19.5% from $38.03 billion in the year-ago period to $30.57 billion, based on our current NFM estimate. This would mark a larger year over year decline in Apple\u2019s most important business than Q1. Meanwhile, Apple\u2019s Services unit is projected to jump nearly 23% from $9.19 billion to reach $11.29 billion. Investors will likely be pleased to note that this estimate comes in above Q1\u2019s 20% Services growth.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7RPp1PGjLzuEfOLAtJIQGw--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/1e41d05731c227de56b0c5b37fcef0de);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7RPp1PGjLzuEfOLAtJIQGw--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/1e41d05731c227de56b0c5b37fcef0de", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qTYk41wt7rpaA9vs75JDzQ--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/c8d4ae9fb2382a91913867b5ac42cfc0", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qTYk41wt7rpaA9vs75JDzQ--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/c8d4ae9fb2382a91913867b5ac42cfc0);"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "facebo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tim cook", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "aapl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "apple aapl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "faang", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "netflix nflx", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "recent news & overview apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alibaba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huawei", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "xiaomi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T02:41:12.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "677d4c6ffc4a1915a671c1b03778a982bfc9eb48", "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/apple-doing-something-china-almost-230510614.html", "site_full": "news.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "http://rss.news.yahoo.com/rss/business\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines", "title": "Apple is doing something in China it almost never does: Cutting iPhone prices", "title_full": "Apple is doing something in China it almost never does: Cutting iPhone prices", "published": "2019-04-02T02:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4N0_lX2vBZG.OQgd6RANPg--~B/aD03MjI7dz05ODI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.news.bgr.com/9a29bd8950416519cfe3a90efbade24a", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "677d4c6ffc4a1915a671c1b03778a982bfc9eb48", "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/apple-doing-something-china-almost-230510614.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T02:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Apple is doing something in China it almost never does: Cutting iPhone prices", "text": "Apple is doing something in China it almost never does: Cutting iPhone prices Andy Meek Reblog Apple is taking something of an unusual step to stem the tide of losses in China that the iPhone maker said at the end of 2018 led to a shortfall in its all-important holiday quarter worth several billion dollars. That shortfall, you may remember, was attributed in large part to lower than anticipated iPhone sales volume in China, which is why it was revealed on Monday that Apple has decided to do something pretty unlike Apple in order to try and make up for it. The solution: Cut prices. A CNBC report Monday notes that Apple took the action earlier this year on official third-party sellers in China like Tmall and JD.com. That report also speculates that Monday\u2019s price cut may be a response to China\u2019s increase in the value-added tax there. Related stories Apple officially cancels AirPower The Apple cuts haven\u2019t just included iPhone sold in China. The company actually dropped prices on most of its key products \u2014 including iPads, Macs and AirPods as well as iPhones \u2014 sold via its official online store in China by almost 6%. In one example, the price of the base model iPhone XR was cut 4.6% from 6499RMB to 6199RMB (which is equivalent to a drop from $968.34 to $923.64). Likewise, CNBC reports that the prices of both the iPhone XS and XS Max were each cut 500RMB, which is equal to almost $75. For some more context around why Apple would do that, consider that 15 percent of Apple\u2019s holiday quarter revenue was attributable to sales from China. During that quarter, though, Apple earned a little more than $13 billion in revenue from China, down almost $5 billion from the same quarter in 2017. \u201cIf you look at our results, our shortfall is over 100 percent from iPhone, and it\u2019s primarily in greater China,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC earlier this year just before the company reported its fourth quarter earnings. Apple hasn\u2019t set a date yet for its next quarterly earnings report, but the assumption is that it will be in early May. It will come amid a subtle shit in emphasis for the company, for which hardware sales remain the biggest revenue-generator. Nevertheless, its top leaders are also keen to grow Apple\u2019s services revenue as hardware sales increasingly mature. Sign up for BGR's Newsletter .

Dan?\nDan Gladney\nThanks Scott. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. It\u2019s been a very busy last few months for us at ReShape Lifesciences as we continue to horn in and optimize our strategy to become a leading provider of solutions for obesity and metabolic diseases.\nAnd this last quarter as certainly one filled with hard work and change, culminating in the acquisition of Apollo\u2019s LAP-BAND product line in exchange for the sale of the ReShape Balloon business to Apollo Endosurgery.\nAlthough, we did discuss in detail a transaction of Apollo, when that deal was announced, I would like to take some time today to reiterate the rationale and then give you some additional information regarding integration and our strategic plan as we move forward.\nAs many of you know, LAP-BAND is a very well known, minimally invasive weight loss technology with over 20 years of commercial success and proven clinical efficacy. We were thrilled when we were made aware of the opportunity to bring this asset into ReShape Lifesciences.\nLAP-BAND is both FDA approved and reimbursed by most private payers in the United States, and in fact, the LAP-BAND is the only weight loss implant technology that is currently reimbursed in the U.S.\nThe acquisition of LAP-BAND has given us an approved reimbursed well known product to offer now for patients in the Body Mass Index of 30 and above and also provide us a distribution system outside the U.S. that is already in place. This will not only allow us to hit the ground running with LAP-BAND internationally, but will also save us both time and money once our next-generation ReShape Vest is approved. We really believe that the product is a perfect addition to our portfolio.\nLAP-BAND has a track record that has brought immediate significant revenue and gross margin to ReShape Lifesciences with very little required investment. As you are aware, much of last year was challenging for ReShape as our cash needs outweighed our ability to finance the company, putting us in a difficult operational position.\nThe addition of the revenue and margin from LAP-BAND could not have come in a better time for the Briatric surge in customer base that is synergistic to the core call point for ReShape since our inception. We are confident in our ability to successfully sell the LAP-BAND, and in fact, have already seen immediate results since the acquisition of the product late last year.\nTouching quickly on our decision to divest the ReShape Balloon. Unfortunately the growth of the ReShape Balloon was not what it was projected to be at the time we acquired the business in October of 2017. This unanticipated underperformance of the Balloon business was primarily due to an FDA letter related to the risk of inter-gastric balloons which hit the business harder than expected.\nIn addition, the cash required to run the ReShape Balloon product line was significantly higher than projected at the time of acquisition. Together, these factors hinder both our ability to generate significant revenue and as a result our ability to further capitalized the company and grow in a way that was consistent with our corporate vision.\nWe therefore made the decision to divest the ReShape Balloon and to cut our losses allowing us to refocus our financial and operational resources on the future and on the ReShape Vest, which we believe is the next big step for bariatric surgery.\nTurning to the integration of the LAP-BAND, we have really hit the ground running in the United States. As you remember, when we acquired the LAP-BAND, the sales trend was on a decline as Apollo was allocated and virtually no resources to the product, and we shared that our goal initially would be to reduce the sales decline.\nWe have increased the number of reps selling the LAP-BAND from two professional that were selling with Apollo to five full-time sales reps in United States, as well as a full-time sales trainer and we already incredibly -- and we're already incredibly excited and proud of the effort from our sales team. In fact, we've already seen a reduction and the sales declined thus far in quarter one.\nOur strategy and approach in addition to reaching new accounts is to stratify the top customers who represent a significant part of the business and to increase the number of LAP-BAND procedures for these accounts. We want to spend more time to field these existing customers who only do a few procedures a year and to help them understand the benefits of doing more procedures. Our reps are really focusing on education and patient follow-up to reinforce the efficacy and success LAP-BAND procedure. We are also working in partnership with some existing accounts and utilizing co-ops spending programs to help drive business.\nNow outside the United States we are working hard to build an infrastructure, which until now that existed for ReShape Lifesciences. OUS markets account for approximately 40% of existing LAP-BAND sales, with Australia being the number one international market for us. As part of the transaction and the transition Apollo has continued to sell the LAP-BAND outside the U.S. in order to give us time to set up our infrastructure.\nOur plan internationally is to focus first on Australia where our goal is to hire two sales professionals and then on to Europe where we are planning to add a third and fourth, excuse me, a three to five person team, all of whom will be supported by distributors in key markets.\nWe are on target to have our infrastructure set up in Australia by the end of April and by the end of second quarter in Europe, at which point we will be a position to realize revenue in those geographies.\nWe are thrilled that this acquisition of LAP-BAND also provides us with the technology that is a perfect precursor to our ReShape Vest, both products wrap around the stomach, they are sold to the same call point the bariatric surgeon and are both incredibly exciting technologies that we believe our best-in-class for weight loss.\nWe also believe that ReShape Vest is the next big step for bariatric surgeon following on the heels of LAP-BAND. Additionally, divesting the ReShape Balloon and acquiring the LAP-BAND provides us with the financial flexibility to further develop the Vest.\nTurning now to the ReShape Vest. We've made great progress in the past few months. In February we held the live surgery training course and investigator meeting in Prague for bariatric surgeons and key opinion leaders who are serving as investigators in the company's ENDURE II trial in the European Union. This training generated our continued excitement about the ReShape Vest.\nAs a reminder, the ReShape Lifesciences ENDURE II trial is an investigative prospective nonrandomized multicenter study to assess the safety and effectiveness of the ReShape Vest for treatment of obese patients. The trial will include up to 95 subjects at eight to 10 investigational sites located in Spain, the Czech Republic, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nOur most exciting news in the Vest is that Dr. Jordi Pujol, our principal investigator in Barcelona, Spain, successfully implanted the first patient in our ENDURE II trial last week. The patient was discharged from the hospital at the expected time and continues to do well.\nOne year data from enrolled subjects will be used to support the CE Marking application for the Vest and we will continue to follow patient outcomes for up to two years. We estimate receiving CE approval in quarter four of 2021.\nTurning to our financial performance, while we ended the third quarter with a healthy amount of cash on the balance sheet, we did spend significantly in the last fourth quarter on the LAP-BAND acquisition and at subsequent integration, which has included building, the OUS infrastructure and adding an entirely new ERP system. Those investment dollars are already showing their benefits in the form of LAP-BAND revenue and margin. We truly believe in this product and its value to ReShape, our customers and our investors.\nIn order to bridge our balance sheet as we wait for a positive financial impact of LAP-BAND sales, we will continue to do some small financings, last Friday, March 29th we announced that the company had entered into a definitive agreement with certain institutional investors for a $2 million convertible note financing. The details of which Scott will share with you later.\nUltimately, once the company shore up its cash position and has a bit more experience traction with LAP-BAND the plan will be to have discussions to relist ReShape Lifesciences stock back on NASDAQ.\nIt is with mixed emotions that I made the decision to retire from being a public company CEO and announced my retirement as the CEO of ReShape Lifesciences. It has been a wonderful experience with the business and a -- that I was so fortunate to work with. I truly believe in the mission and the vision of ReShape.\nI worked closely with the Board that handpicked Bart as my replacement and I believe he is the perfect fit. I thank everyone for the opportunity to be CEO and lead such a wonderful team and I'm thrilled to be able to stay involve as the Chairman of the Board.\nI am now turning the call back over to Scott Youngstrom, our CFO, who will walk you through our financial results. Scott?\nScott Youngstrom\nThanks, Dan. Let me highlight a few activities that occurred over the last quarter of 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2018 the company's Board of Directors and stockholders approved a 1-for-140 reverse split of the company's outstanding common stock that became effective after the close of market on November 7, 2018. [Inaudible] and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock splits for all periods presented.\nOn November 25, 2018, the company raised $10 million through a registered direct offering, which supplemented the $16 million that was raised through the company's aftermarket stock offering programs throughout October and November of 2018. These capital raises enabled the company to move forward with a significant and strategic business.\nOn December 17, 2018, the company acquired Apollo Endosurgery -- acquired from Apollo Endosurgery substantially all of the assets exclusively related to Apollo's LAP-BAND product line and Apollo acquired from ReShape substantially all of the assets exclusively related to our ReShape Balloon product line.\nAs part of the agreement we were also required to pay Apollo a cash consideration of $17 million of which $10 million was paid at the closing of the transaction, $2 million is payable on each of the first and second anniversaries of the transaction, and $3 million is payable on the third anniversary of the closing date.\nAdditionally, as a part of the transition services agreement, Apollo will manufacture the LAP-BAND on our behalf for up to two years, served as our distributor of the LAP-BAND product outside of the U.S. for up to one year and provide other specified services.\nAs Dan mentioned earlier, last week on March 29th we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement with certain institutional investors for a $2 million convertible note financing, which will be in the form of a private placement. In connection with the financing we will also amend the exercise price of warrants to purchase up to 8 million shares of common stock held by the investors that were issued on November 25, 2018, from $1.50 per share to a penny per share.\nMoving on to the financial results for 2018, when you review our financial statements and related footnotes in our 10-K, you will notice significant changes in our presentation due to the reporting requirement surrounding our acquisition of the LAP-BAND product line. You will notice a line called loss from discontinued operations net of tax that removes the effects of our Balloon business, which we sold as part of the Apollo transaction. Our 2018 and ongoing financial analysis will focus on our performance for our continuing operations.\nFor example, our revenue for the year ended 2018 totaled $2.8 million. However, we are reporting $607,000 as this is comprised of $450,000 of LAP-BAND revenue for the 14-day period from December 18th to December 31st plus $156,000 of revenue generated in 2018 by the vBloc product line.\nIn comparison, we reported $1.3 million of total revenue 2017. However, in our continuing operations, we will show -- only show $569,000 for the year ended 2017, which is comprised of $319,000 of vBloc revenue and $250,000 of service revenue. No activity associated with the Balloon product is reflected in our ongoing financial statements. However, details of our Balloon business can be found in the footnotes to our financial statements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we reported ongoing revenues of $607,000 and gross profit totaling $442,000, a gross margin percentage of 73%. For the year ended December 31, 2017, ongoing revenues were $569,000 and gross profit totaled $236,000, a gross margin percentage of 41%.\nThe significant increase in gross margin in 2018 was driven by the higher margin LAP-BAND product line as compared to the lower vBloc and service revenue margins generated in the comparable prior period.\nThe company anticipates gross margins will remain in the 70% to 75% range throughout 2019. This is a significant improvement over the 25%, 3% and 13% gross margins reported by the company our previous three quarters of 2018, respectively, which primarily reflected the previously discussed low margins associated with the product Balloon line.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2018, the company reported revenues from continuing operations for the LAP-BAND product of $450,000 and associated gross profit of $372,000. There were no corresponding revenues from continuing operations for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018, totaled $16.3 million, as compared to $22.8 million in 2017. This decrease is primarily due to the reduction in headcount as compared to the prior year and lower overall expenditures as a part of our integration strategy.\nIncluded in SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018, were stock-based compensation and warrant expense of $2.9 million, inventory write-offs for obsolete product of $2 million, legal fees related to patent infringement defense and transactional fees of $2 million and severance of $569,000.\nIncluded in SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, in addition to the expenses picked up with the BarioSurg acquisition included a non-cash charge of $8.7 million related to stock compensation and warrants expense.\nPrior year SG&A also included $1.2 million of expenses related to our acquisition, $1.1 million associated with severance and one-time charges, and $720,000 of amortization expense, a total of $3 million.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, were $4.3 million, as compared to $6.4 million for the third quarter 2018. The company feels that the current quarterly run rate of approximately $4.5 million is indicative of the SG&A expenses to be incurred throughout 2019.\nResearch and development expenses for 2018 totaled $5.4 million, as compared to a similar amount of $5.4 million for 2017. This is primarily due to the development of the gastric vest and the vBloc block and stem research throughout both 2018 and 2017. For 2019, our primary R&D investments will be on the ReShape Vest product line as minimal R&D will be required for the LAP-BAND product line.\nWe continue to review our organization including our cost structure in an effort to best align revenues and costs. As part of the integration and cost control efforts, we have reduced our overall employee count from a combined 97 ReShape medical and EnteroMedics employees at the beginning of 2018 to a total of 36 ReShape Lifesciences employees at present.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $5.5 million and the company's debt was the $7 million asset purchase consideration payable to Apollo for the LAP-BAND product line. We are targeting our net monthly burn in 2019 to be no more than $800,000 per month.\nLastly with the earlier discussed acquisition of LAP-BAND, expansion in our sales force and our reach into the OUS markets and with the recently announced addition of our new CEO with previous LAP-BAND experience, we want to reiterate that our strategy is one of controlled expansion as we grow into our new markets while at the same time preserving cash to support the clinical programs around our ReShape Vest.\nWe feel that we will be better able to give revenue guidance after experiencing a few more quarters of activity. We have a goal to turn the U.S. revenue decline around and optimize the OUS markets by revitalizing previous customers.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Bart Bandy, our new President and CEO. Bart is a seasoned leader in the medical technology space with almost three decades of experience, a third of which time was spent building the LAP-BAND market and awareness for both Inamed and Allergan. What a perfect fit for Bart to bring his experience and vast network within bariatrics as he helps us build the future of ReShape. We could not be more excited for Bart to join the team. Bart, we welcome you to ReShape.\nBart Bandy\nThanks, Scott. I could not be more pleased to be at ReShape Lifesciences. As Scott mentioned, I have spent over the past 25 years in various operational and commercial leadership roles with a significant portion of that time dedicated to this obesity space. Given my experience in building and growing organizations\u2019 product and sales in healthcare and bariatric surgery specifically, this is a great fit for me.\nIt was a tremendous pleasure to oversee the growth of the LAP-BAND technology during my years at Inamed and then Allergan, and I am truly excited to be reunited with this technology and to bring my experiences to ReShape.\nI see a unique opportunity in ReShape and that there is still is a treatment gap that has not been filled for most obese patients. The technology is there but the market awareness and penetration has never been realized. ReShape has the solutions, both with the LAP-BAND and with the exciting ReShape Vest that is currently enrolling patients for the CE Mark study in Europe. Our product portfolio has an exceptional opportunity to drive sustainable growth in a global market.\nTurning to my vision for ReShape Lifesciences, the technologies at ReShape truly change people's lives, both physically and emotionally. That is what gets me excited. We will work with the KOLs and the physician community to build a robust technology roadmap that thinks ahead into the future, establishes deep awareness of the clinical evidence to support the benefits of our technologies from both an outcomes and a cost perspective, and build a best-in-class team dedicated to enhance professional and patient education from surgical discernment and practice through post-procedural follow-up.\nWorking together with the committed community of medical professional we can enhance patient outcomes and improve the lives of many people battling obesity and metabolic disease. I look forward to spending more time with all of our stakeholders over the coming months and providing updates on our strategies and progress. Thank you for everyone to come out today.\nQ -\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude your program and you may all disconnect.

ShieldSaver uses proprietary license-plate recognition technology to gather data on both cars and consumers, which can be used for several purposes. The most obvious is to identify when repairs are needed to approach car owners about getting the work done. But the data also has value to other stakeholders , such as insurance companies, parking-lot owners, parts suppliers and people buying cars, as it can give them a better understanding of both individual vehicles and the bigger picture.

The Indian company was awarded the contract to supply over twenty-six thousand male condoms. Critics have questioned why local pharmaceutical companies were not given the contract. But speaking to Citi News, the Public Relations Officer of the Ministry of Health, Elorm Ametepe said the contract was awarded after an International competitive tendering process. According to him, after financial evaluation and tests by the FDA on the condoms, the company that offered the lowest price was given the contract. \u201cIt was an international competitive tender which was advertised so it was open to all companies both local and international. After the initial evaluation, samples of the condoms submitted by each of the bidders were sent to the Food and Drugs Authority for quality testing. Only those condoms that passed the quality testing were evaluated financially. The company that offered the least price was selected and in accordance with the procurement law, the recommendations of the evaluation report were sent to the central tender review committee and they scrutinized and gave their approval.\u201d He said the contract was given in accordance with the procurement law, the recommendations of the evaluation report were sent to the Central Tender Review Committee. \u201cThere is this erroneous impression that the public procurement authority gives approval for a recommendation for the award of contracts. The law requires that the results of the tender are published at the GPA website.

Gavin Newsom. Siebel Newsom has eschewed the traditional title of \"first lady\" and instead prefers \"first partner.\"\nThe group announced \"13 inaugural corporate commitments to their CA Equal Pay Pledge,\" including Apple. Apple did not respond to a request by CNBC for comment.\n\"Anything that brings attention to the fact that this still exists, and especially gets a high-profile effort to get companies to make the commitment to pay equity, is encouraging,\" said Ariela Gross, a professor of law and history at the University of Southern California Law School.\nAccording to Siebel Newsom, the \"13 inaugural signatories\" agreed to voluntarily conduct an annual companywide gender pay analysis as well as review hiring and promotion processes \"to reduce unconscious bias and structural barriers and promote best practices that will close the pay gap to ensure fundamental equity for all workers.\"\n\"We do see when audits happen, we discover, 'Oh yeah, look, it turns out there are these discrepancies,'\" said Gross. \"There's a lot that can be done to remedy them.\"\nCalifornia women \u2014 about 41 percent of the state's workforce \u2014 make 89 cents for every dollar that men make , according the National Partnership for Women & Families, a D.C.-based nonpartisan advocacy group. The figure averages 80 cents nationally, translating into an annual gender wage gap of $10,169.\n\"The wage gap across the country has been very persistent over the years,\" said Vasu Reddy, senior policy counsel for workplace programs at the national partnership group.\nAccording to Reddy, California has one of the smaller wage gaps among states, but she said it's still tough on women because of the state's high cost of living. \"We're talking about a gap that is still costing women thousands of dollars each year that could be spent on food, housing payments, utilities, and other basic necessities,\" she said.\nAmong other companies participating in the equal-pay pledge are Salesforce and Airbnb, both based in California.\n\"Equal pay is not just about the equitable treatment of women or an individual company's fair treatment of women \u2014 it is about human belonging,\" said Beth Axelrod, vice president of global employee experience at Airbnb. \"And for Airbnb, whose mission is belonging, equal pay is foundational when it comes to advancing belonging \u2014 and that means equal pay for equal work for all.\"\n\"Four years ago, Salesforce committed to equal pay for equal work and it has become part of our company DNA,\" said a Salesforce spokesperson who didn't wish to be identified. \"But this isn't something we want to own by ourselves \u2014 industry action is crucial.\"\nDallas-based AT&T also is on the list as an inaugural participant.\n\"AT&T is committed to pay equality \u2014 regardless of gender or ethnicity \u2014 for people who hold the same jobs, have the same experience and performance levels, and work in the same geographic area,\" said Rhonda Johnson, state president of AT&T California. \"Equal pay for equal work is part of our strong commitment to a diverse and inclusive workforce, and we appreciate the opportunity to join First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom in this ground-breaking initiative.\"\nThe California Commission on the Status of Women and Girls participated in Monday's announcement, which includes a campaign to raise awareness of the pay gap in California and targets employers, labor unions and employees.\n\"We are excited to have sponsored the work of the Pay Equity Task Force and recognize the importance of these resources in establishing a real cultural change in the state of California that ensures women are treated equitably in the workplace,\" said CCSWG Chair Alisha Wilkins.\nThe launch of the campaign follows the Democratic-led U.S. House last week voting 242-187 in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act , a measure co-sponsored by more than 200 Democrats and Republican Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey. The proposed federal legislation includes amending the Equal Pay Act to allow plaintiffs to participate in class-action lawsuits for cases of pay discrimination.\nSeven Republicans in the House voted for the Paycheck Fairness Act. However, the legislation faces a less-certain future in the GOP-controlled Senate. Critics of the proposed bill have called it \"misguided.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/workplace/fair-pay/americas-women-and-the-wage-gap.pdf", "https://www.gov.ca.gov/2019/04/01/first-partner-jennifer-siebel-newsom-the-california-commission-on-the-status-of-women-and-girls-and-times-up-launch-equalpayca-to-help-close-the-pay-gap-in-california/&quot;", "https://www.heritage.org/government-regulation/commentary/democrats-paycheck-fairness-act-would-make-them-pay-some-male", "https://www.gov.ca.gov/2019/04/01/first-partner-jennifer-siebel-newsom-the-california-commission-on-the-status-of-women-and-girls-and-times-up-launch-equalpayca-to-help-close-the-pay-gap-in-california/", "https://www.heritage.org/government-regulation/commentary/democrats-paycheck-fairness-act-would-make-them-pay-some-male&quot;", "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/house-democrats-advance-the-paycheck-fairness-act", "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/house-democrats-advance-the-paycheck-fairness-act&quot;", "http://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/workplace/fair-pay/americas-women-and-the-wage-gap.pdf&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "salesforce", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jennifer siebel newsom", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "siebel newsom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ariela gross", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gavin newsom", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "siebel newsom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of southern california law school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T03:05:39.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "59b14846970ba49ed080af784a97f5b47c450f5d", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-inc-to-move-court-against-power-tariff-hike/articleshow/68677030.cms", "site_full": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Nashik News, Latest Nashik News Headlines &amp; Live Updates - Times of India", "title": "Nashik Inc to move court against power tariff hike", "title_full": "Nashik Inc to move court against power tariff hike | Nashik News - Times of India", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "59b14846970ba49ed080af784a97f5b47c450f5d", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-inc-to-move-court-against-power-tariff-hike/articleshow/68677030.cms", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tushar Pawar", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Nashik Inc to move court against power tariff hike", "text": "NASHIK: Prominent industrial associations in Nashik have decided to take the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) to court over the recent hike in power tariff for industries and consumers that will be implemented from April 1, 2019.\nThe associations have decided to move high court once they get the electricity bills based on revised fresh tariff.

There should be uniform power tariff across the state. Otherwise, industries would move elsewhere,\u201d he added.\n\u201cWe are upset with the fresh tariff hike.

The Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2018 was filed by the company with the SEC today.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Dr. Bassam Damaj. Dr. Damaj?\nBassam Damaj\nThank you, Gary and good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. As we discuss performance of our business during the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. As we announced about a week ago 2018 was a very exciting year for Innovus as we achieved our stated goal of $24 million in revenues, which is 2.7 times our revenues from 2017. And we were also able to reduce our loss from operations by decreasing our sales and marketing expenses as percentage of revenue for the fourth quarter. And we were able to increase our gross margin for our product to 81%.\nAnd we were able to achieve this by doing four things. One, optimizing our sales and marketing platform to the highest return on our investment and print media outlets. Second, adding additional successful new products. Third, extending our sales and marketing in Canada. Fourth, expanding our online sales. And fifth by adding new sales channels for our products.\nWe continue to make significant and fast strides as we continue and work towards our goal of sustained growth and profitability. And before I go into my details discussion on our corporate and business performance, I would like to turn the floor over to Ryan. So he can discuss our financial results. Ryan?\nRyan Selhorn\nThank you, Bassam. As Bassam mentioned, our annual revenue for 2018 was $24 million, compared with $8.8 million in the previous year, a 2.7 times increase. And our fourth quarter 2018 revenue was $4.8 million compared with the same quarter in the previous year of $2.4 million, or 100% growth. It is worth noting that we started generating revenues in 2015 with $750,000, which increased to $4.4 million in 2016 to $8.8 million in 2017 and to $24 million in 2018. And we expect the growth to continue to 2019 and beyond.\nThis is an impressive growth trajectory by all measures compared to many other publically traded companies in our space, and same market cap both on the OTC and NASDAQ.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we firstly reduced our quarterly revenue growth to improve our operating results by defining highest return print media outlets for our products in specific demographic and geographic targets. Our revenue growth continues to be driven by our core products, which we have defined as product generating over $1 million annually, or which are on a run rate to achieve $1 million annually, including Diabasense, Vesele, UriVarx, FlutiCare, Apeaz, ProstaGorx and Sensum.\nAdditionally, we are excited that we expect to launch at least eight new products in 2019 and beyond including ThermoMax, BreastLift and HealthiFeet all acquired from Boston Topicals in December 2018 as well as internally developed products, MZS sleeping aid sleeping our first Hemp-Derived THC-free oil, Trexar for enhanced sensation, Ride Rx [ph] for muscle soreness, Musclin to increase muscle mass endurance and activity, Regenerum to increase muscle fiber with along allowing longer and more intense exercise and Octiq as a lubricant for the for eye redness.\nDuring the fourth quarter we continue to expand into the Canadian market with approximately 27% of fourth quarter product sales generated in Canada, bringing our annual product revenue from Canada to approximately 19%. As we've announced during the first quarter, we now have 12 products approved by Health Canada and intend to continue to market there.\nIn addition, we're working with Health Canada, to expand our branding, and potentially add additional indications, allowing us to promote our approved products for a larger patient population.\nMoving to discuss our monthly subscription revenues, which is defined by monthly auto shipments of products to our customers, this is a very profitable channel of our business, as the only cost to the company is the cost of the product and the shipping. Our goal is to keep increasing our monthly subscription to levels to add profits to our bottom line. Our subscription channel continued to grow in the fourth quarter recognizing $1.1 million in sales, a 22% increase from the previous quarter of $860,000.\nOur total annual subscription revenue was $3.1 million compared with $1.6 million in the previous year, an annual growth rate of 93%. We continue to focus on ways to improve our customers experience with our products to encourage more consistent usage and purchasing.\nOur gross margin for product sales for the year was 81.1%, an increase over the previous year\u2019s rate of 79%. We continue to work to find efficiencies in our fulfillment expenses, especially as we diversify our revenue channels as Bassam will discuss shortly.\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 65.5% in the fourth quarter, compared to 71.3% in the previous quarter, and 83.4% in the comparable quarter in 2017. And for the year the sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue was 71.7% compared with 77.8% in the previous year.\nAs we previously discussed, this is a primary focus for the business to identify ways to reduce the sales and marketing expenses to generate new sales, which will help us achieve our goal of profitability. We will accomplish this by using our proprietary beyond human sales and marketing platform to systematically produce the strongest return on our marketing spends. Throughout 2018, we have been able to gather a significant amount of data regarding the effectiveness of print marketing spend in both the U.S. and in Canada and we are now using this proprietary data to optimize our marketing spend for current products and for the launch of our new products.\nAdditionally, we have launched a new concierge service, which assigns personal reps to our customers and works with them to keep them on their subscriptions longer and introduce new products without the need for a large marketing spend in the media.\nThe revenue recognized from repeat customers, which includes the subscription platform is instrumental to the direct to consumer platform, and the continued growth in this avenue makes us optimistic for the future results.\nGeneral and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue for the year was 33.6% compared with 58.7% in the previous year. As we've mentioned, on previous calls we do not believe that our general and administrative expenses will rise significantly in future quarters compared with our continued expect revenue growth as we feel we now have an established and experienced team to focus on future growth and profitability within the organization.\nLoss from operations for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was $1.36 million, which includes $319,000 of non-cash stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, compared with $1.5 million in the previous quarter with $301,000 on non-cash items. We were happy to see improvement in the loss from operations in the fourth quarter despite reducing our revenues by $2.6 million during first quarter compared to the third quarter, while having to maintain a consistent general and administrative expense. We believe we're moving in the right direction towards profitability.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2018, we used approximately $500,000 in cash from operations compared with the usage of $2.1 million during the third quarter of 2018. Cash management remains a critical -- remains critical within the organization and is ideally driven by appropriate inventory management focused on ordering the necessary units at the right time, while taking advantage of the most optimal pricing from our manufacturers.\nLastly, at March 29, 2019 our cash balances are currently $1.7 million with an additional cash held by our merchant processors of approximately $600,000, which we record in other current assets for a total of $2.3 million.\nWith that, I will turn the call back to Bassam.\nBassam Damaj\nThank you, Ryan. We are very proud to report that 2.7 times increase in our growth of our revenues from 2017 to 2018. And with that the expansion of our commercial capabilities and product growth to over 30 products sold in the U.S. and Canada and in nearly 10 additional countries will not. Although we are happy with the strong and consistent revenue growth and the high margins we have achieved, I am not happy we did not reach profitability yet, as this is something we as a company need to achieve as soon as reasonably possible.\nWith that relatively fast growth in order to be self-sustaining in the long run, be profitable and recognize the true value of the company, by uplisting to a national exchange, we will need to do four main things. First, we need to be able to raise enough non-debt capital to allow us to launch as many products as we can to increase the bottom line from each product to cover our G&A and meet the liquidity and stock shareholder equity requirements for NASDAQ uplisting.\nSecond, we need to be very selective in our marketing spend and only spent on marketing channels and products that yield high and profitable returns. Third, we need to add new revenue channel, such as proprietary ingredients and or offer private label products where there is zero marketing costs to the company for the revenues generated. And fourth, increase our online presence and start using our online platforms as marketplaces to increase the product offerings from third parties and revenues from those products from the listing and sales of those products.\nAnd let me detail each of those four points, because I think those are important pillars to our strategy and business to reach our goal of profitability.\nFirst, let's discuss about our planned NASDAQ uplisting. We all know the limitations of being listed on the OTC market in terms of liquidity, valuations, inability of more funds to invest in companies like us, independent -- the lack of independent analyst coverage, expensive capital raises and artificial down valuation of companies by certain group and [indiscernible].\nI am sure, you felt as we felt that a few days ago when our share price was brought down artificially to $1.50 by certain group, which prompted the company to call the OTC market and FINRA and request they investigate. Lucky for us we were able to recover and we thank both the market surveys group at the OTC markets and the short sales compliance group at FINRA for taking and addressing our complaints and be assured that we will be calling upon FINRA and the OTC Markets whenever we feel that there is something artificial going on with the share price.\nI think the strong vote the company received by shareholders to affect a reverse split shows both management and shareholders are along and on Board to do what is needed to meet NASDAQ requirements and uplift as soon as possible. And here I would like to thank our shareholders for their vote of confidence that allowed the company to effectively this reverse split and have enough shares to bring in the required shareholder equity to uplist. I can tell you that the company has already submitted this application to uplift to NASDAQ capital market. And we are working with the NASDAQ initial listing team to ensure that we meet all of the uplisting requirements. And we will keep you update -- upraised on the progress towards that goal.\nSecond, I want to discuss our selective marketing spending as this is very important. As Ryan described, we are laser focused on growing our revenues in the most efficient manner. To do so I would like to elaborate on three main pillars of this effort. First, using a three years' worth of data from our proprietary beyond human sales and marketing platform to close to 1 million customers and from thousands of newspapers and magazines as we were able to determine, which of our product can be sold with greatest return of the investment in the best direct-to-consumer method, such as either a newspaper, a magazine, a direct mail, a postcard, et cetera.\nThis was a big breakthrough for us. Because as you have seen some our fourth quarter, we spend less on marketing and achieved higher return. And we will continue to do so and add as many products as we can to finally be able to generate enough profits from our sales to cover our G&A.\nSecond, negotiating more favorable rates from our service providers from the call centers, distribution, inventory control, posters and the like, the sheer dollar volume and amount we spend with our marketing agency service providers and manufacturers allows us now to negotiate better pricing, better payment terms allowing more money towards our EBITDA and more flexible use of our cash.\nAnd third, increasing the number of products in our core group of seven products that sell or have the potential to sell more than 1 million per year and de-phasing the sale of certain products that cannot meet those core product criteria. We believe adding an additional five different products in our core group of products will allow us to generate enough profit to cover our G&A expenses and move to overall profitability.\nBy doing so, we are putting the majority of our marketing and sales dollars into our core products and trying to elevate certain other products into this core product category. At the same time that we are doing this and we are focusing on our core products, we are evaluating ways to capitalize on our non-core products by evaluating whether a spinoff of a publically trading company with those products add dividends to the shareholders, or just an outright sales to another company would maximize the value of such products beyond their current revenue to the company.\nThe acquisition of Boston Topicals product is a good example, adding CBD oil based product and negotiating additional OTC ANDA drug that has switched from Rx to OTC to add to our pipeline are just examples of how we're trying to add more products and accelerate this process.\nThe third pillar is adding new revenue channels. Now adding new revenue channels where the marketing costs is a fraction of our print marketing costs is a big focus for the company. The company has a growing number of proprietary ingredients clinically validated and a lot -- and are in large demand by a large number of supplement companies that look for branded and patented ingredient.\nThis is a strategy employed by large pharma across the globe to complement their [indiscernible] and non-costly revenue. Add to that that we are looking as a potential to private label some of our products to other companies or a second brand of our products as now they are known and in demand to be able to generate revenues without the high cost of direct marketing. Those type of channels, although we do not expect them to become the major source of revenues for the company, we believe should add significant profit to our EBITDA and contribute to our profitability and get us there faster.\nThe forth pillar is expanding our online presence and start using our platform as marketplaces. Now that we have a large and established online presence, by very large revenue generating stores, online stores across the globe, acquiring platforms such as Prime Saving Supplement Hunt. And our new Asian marketplace being developed will allow us not just to expand the offering of our products, but also allowing third parties to sell on our platform, which will bring us lifting revenues, services and the like.\nAnd we have been experiencing this through our current Supplement Hunt and private saving costs, where we have now launch a few brands such as Muscle Effect, SlimFast, Vega and the like seeing on our platforms. The more we add third party products the more we generate revenues without the need to spend on marketing costs.\nSo all the efforts of the company are currently focused on achieving these goals and the take home point from my discussion today are six fold. First, we now [indiscernible] significant and consistent revenue year-over-year, which we expect to continue to grow for 2019 and beyond. Our revenues are not one-off revenues. They're not revenues from a single licensing deal. Those are revenues from product sales consisting and growing product sales. This is very important point.\nSecond, we were able to achieve high product gross margins of 81% specifically 81.1%. And this is very important because for us, the larger the gross margins, the more potential profit for the company. And having margins of 81.18% is a great achievement by any means for any company.\nThird, we have an exceptional and growing proprietary product pipeline. As you have seen our products continue to grow, the number of units we ship continues to grow both in the U.S. and in additional territories as we add new channels, new markets, and this is how we are continuing to grow as we said we have a very strong pipeline coming up, that we expect to continue the growth of the company.\nFour, as I mentioned before, we have filed our application with NASDA to uplist to the NASDAQ Capital Market and we are working to meet the initial listing requirements to potentially list on the NASDAQ market as soon as we have those requirements met.\nWe are only right now spending marketing dollars on products and channels that yield high return and add to our EBITDA to take us to profitability. And here we get a lot of focus from shareholders, why aren't you selling this product on this channel? Why is your product now at this price on Amazon? Why are you doing this? And why are you doing that, and we always keep telling them we cannot disclose this information.\nWe know which channels are the high yielding channels for us. We know what channels do not require a lot of amount of marketing dollars. And we will stay focused laser focused on only spending marketing dollars on those specific products and channels that will only add high returns to our EBITDA and take us to profitability.\nAnd six, and I think this is an important point if we are able to execute our spin-off of the non-core product, it would be the first time in the history of Innovus that we\u2019ll potentially pay a dividend to its shareholder. And again, we have a lot of shareholders that have been with us for a long time. It is very rewarding for shareholders to be in companies where there is potentially a path to being paid a dividend.\nAnd with this, I thank you for your continued support and interest in our company. And I'll open the line of questions for our analysts. And then I will follow by the responding to the long list of questions received from the shareholders by phone and by email. Operator?\nOperator\nWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Beth Senko with Zacks. Please go ahead.\nBeth Senko\nHi, guys. I hope you can hear me. It's a little echo in here. Question, on the media expense ratio, it looks like it dropped about 500 basis points to about 70% just measured strictly by marketing expense or overall sales and marketing in the quarter to play sales the quarter, I'm wondering if you can break out how that looks for the U.S. versus Canada. I think as we spoke last quarter, Canada has got a much better MER than the U.S. and I'm just wondering how much of that drop is just more the Canadian sales and if you could comment on the trend in the U.S. market?\nRyan Selhorn\nThanks, Beth. That\u2019s absolutely a great question and you are correct that the sales and marketing expense did drop overall. So in terms of breaking it out for you, the Canadian market is -- tends to be anywhere from I\u2019d say 25% to 40% better than the U.S. market from a media efficiency ratio. And, so we continue to see that. So some of the change and the reduction in the percentage overall is from increasing to Canada.\nBut we also, as we kind of mentioned, we've specifically focused on certain newspapers and magazines within the United States that are providing us with better media efficiency ratios, and we\u2019ll continue to do that. So there's a little bit of a combination of both the improvement on the U.S. strategy as well as expanding further into Canada.\nBeth Senko\nOkay, good. Second question then on direct mail used to be a big part of your marketing expense, like it just recently is and as far as second quarter of 2018, have you dropped direct marketing entirely or at least direct postal marketing?\nRyan Selhorn\nNo, so another good point. So direct mail is still a very -- a primary focus of ours of our attention and we do significantly well in direct mail. We did slow down the direct mail a little bit in the fourth quarter, compared to what we've done in the previous quarters. A lot of it has to do with some of the end of the year strategy that we kind of implemented. But I can tell you that moving into the future, we will continue to use direct mail quite a bit as we've been able to optimize those returns and they're pretty consistent from campaign by campaign. So we always know what we're going to get.\nBassam Damaj\nI think here also Beth, I'd like to maybe interject, I think it's important that we've been doing this now for three consecutive years. So we know when is the best time to launch a campaign whether it is in the newspapers or in the direct postage, and the year-end is not actually a good time to do that. So, companies learned the hard way, now we have three years behind us, so now we tend to choose and prepare ahead of time, when we will know that we will see a good respond versus do not spend on newspapers, on ex-holiday, you know what I mean.\nSo, that is actually coming -- is making the platform more efficient, where now we don't have -- we know that we should not be spending expensive marketing dollars at this time at this campaign, but we need to spend that at a different time.\nBeth Senko\nSo -- go ahead. I was going to say and then on that note, first quarter is historically the time when everybody wants to make their lives better. So should I assume we should expect a big step up sequentially in marketing spend. And I'm wondering if there are any particular large campaigns that have occurred in the first quarter that we should be on the lookout for when you report earnings.\nBassam Damaj\nMaybe as a separate point, as we said, we -- although we are experiencing growth, and we\u2019ll potentially see that when we put our numbers out. But our main goal is not just to increase revenue here, our main goal is to keep the efficiency and higher MERs in order really to start generating enough profit to cover the company's G&A and expenses and move to profitability.\nSo as I mentioned before in my previous call, I am not looking to double revenues to $50 million and making $60 million, something we can do. But my goal is to grow, but to be able to be a profitable growth. So there are not actually several campaigns that we started, of course, because as you mentioned, the beginning of the year, the January and so February are actually very good time in order to start the new campaigns. And we did actually quite a bit of new campaigns, but those are efficient and high return campaign for us.\nBeth Senko\nOkay. Last two questions, sort of both related to cash. One, if we were to look at this potential business spin-off. How much of the inventory on your balance sheet is related to these non-core products? Because I guess, spin-off doesn't work the other option, of course, is just write down that inventory?\nRyan Selhorn\nSure. Yes. So\u2026\nBeth Senko\nI know it's...\nRyan Selhorn\nNo, that's quite all right. So from an inventory standpoint, we don't think that the non-core products are really that significant to the $2.4 million that we have on the balance sheet as of year-end. So, they're not that material compared to our core products.\nBeth Senko\nOkay, good. And then lastly, I can't remember the number $2.5 million or $3.5 million, $2.3 million, I guess you've got in cash on the balance sheet?\nRyan Selhorn\nCorrect, correct.\nBeth Senko\nYes. Is that enough? I mean, you just a financing, do you need to do another one, can you give us some guidance when that's going to -- when you're going to have to go back to the trough?\nBassam Damaj\nI think it's important to note here, Beth, is that our focus right now, I mean, we just filed our 10-K and you probably -- I don't know, if you had a chance to see it, but basically\u2026\nBeth Senko\nNo.\nBassam Damaj\nAgain, there is no going concern on the company's liquidity, which means there is enough cash, whether from the cash we have or the revenues coming in on production that will cover the expenses. But -- and as I mentioned in my call it the important for the market to understand that we want to uplist to NASDAQ. In order to uplist to NASDAQ, there are specific shareholder equity requirement the company has to have and specific actually NASDAQ looks at cash and liquidity different way than has been looked actually by other markets.\nSo, we need to take that into account that we would need to raise what we need to raise in order to meet those requirements and uplist to NASDAQ. Because I actually will not and do not want to see another scene like what happened last week with some certain market makers that really tries to bring the stock down to $1.50. This is something -- and always think about the cash requirement that what is required to meet the NASDAQ capital requirements initial listing.\nBeth Senko\nOkay. And have you had any preliminary meetings with investors either debt or equity, which would get you away from this convertible debt, which is rightfully expensive?\nBassam Damaj\nSo maybe we should clear out. I mean, the debt we have is non-convertible, whether the company decides to settle or not now this is the decision, but we do not take any convertible note. The note we have are non-secured, non-convertible that really are paid off mostly either equity six times, or in monthly payments. But as you've mentioned, there are a lot of funds out there that cannot invest in OTC traded companies.\nAnd we have a great history with those funds, we have a great relationship with them. And the management does not believe that it will be actually difficult for the company if there is an uplisting to be at the same time as raise. We will not go and do a raise without an uplisting, any raising of equity needs to be done in conjunction with an uplisting to NASDAQ.\nBeth Senko\nGot it. Okay, thank you so much.\nBassam Damaj\nNo problem. And go ahead.\nOperator\nShowing no further questions on the phone. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for some previously submitted questions.\nBassam Damaj\nThank you. Thank you, Gary. So here, I was like, actually, we've received several pages of questions from the shareholders actually. And I think I would like to go through them. As we always do and try to -- and we believe this is the most efficient way of answering all your questions that you send us. The first question is coming what are your plans to uplist to NASDAQ? Why don't you do that now?\nI mean, I believe we addressed the NASDAQ uplisting plans in details on my call. So we will not go into more answers to this.\nThe second question, when will you hear from your partner about the second FlutiCare and approval?\nWe have been advised by our ANDA manufacturing partner that they're still working with the FDA on getting the final approval for the OTC ANDA. We really -- this is in the FDA hands, not in our hands. We will update the shareholders as soon as there is the formal approval from the FDA. We are eager to see the approval as you all are and we will definitely update you once that happens.\nThe third question is coming, what are the results of your core product pilot study with CBS?\nSo, as you probably know, we had three products in the pilot program with CVS. It was I believe 12 stores chosen by CVS not by us and the company was not actually allowed to market those products or push any marketing spend on those. CVS wanted to see what those products will do on their own.\nOne of the products this graduate actually from the pilot programs to category arrival, and we've had multiple discussions with CVS and the different category managers, and we await the response of the category manager response, which is held in July or November pending the opening available on their shelf space. So we are actually working with CVS on one of those products. And we will update as soon as we have an answer from the category manager.\nThe fourth question, what are the company's plans for its current CBD oil product and for future CBD oil products?\nI mean, we publicly disclose that we launched our first CBD oil product, which is MZS Sleeping Aid in the U.S. We recently did that. I mean, as you know the CBD oil and Hemp-Derived product is a growing market that is developing little by little but one has to be careful with two things. First, commercializing those products in 14 states is still illegal. There are 14 states in the U.S. that have restriction on settings dietary supplements containing CBD oil, believe it or not, although the farm bill has passed, Congress, but the state have their own regulations and companies especially public companies have to be very careful with this. So not to be actually entangled in legal battles with those states.\nIn addition, there are -- there is very limited number of merchant processors and banks that will accept to either process payments through credit card payments, or even accept to deposit cash in their bank, if it is derived from the sale of CBD oil. And I'm sure many of you don't know this, we still in the U.S. we still have restrictions, this is not Canada, Canada is a much more open market.\nBut again, we have to be very careful with that. We still believe that this is a market that is worth going to that's why we went into this market. And we believe that we should continue to be in the market and consider additional opportunities of products or partnerships to grow in that specific aid.\nThe fifth question, why has there been no insider buying for a long time, there has been plenty of opportunities to get shares at a great discount?\nFirst of all I do agree with the shareholder that the share are at the great discount right now. So, -- but management and board members did buy on the open market multiple times. Shareholders, can confirm that by the Form 4 that have been filed with the SEC. But also shareholders have to bear in mind that our insider information policy and the number of transactions we do the management and the Board of Directors are continuously in possession of insider information and thus we are prohibited from buying shares on the open market, while we are in possession of this information, we do a large amount of transactions we are continuously growing. So the management does have insider information all the time.\nBut when we feel that it is the right time, and that there is no legal issues to buy shares on the open market, we will do it as we have done it in the past.\nThe next question, why do you have such great difficulty in achieving profitability despite excellent gross margins?\nI mean, here I think we discussed in details why we didn't achieve the profitability in 2018 and what we\u2019re doing to achieve it. But again, I mean profitability is a process this is not something that happens overnight. And I think it is important to understand that most companies that are profitable usually do it over a period of five years or more to achieve that profitability because it has to be sustained. And we only started to make significant revenues three years ago. I mean again, grand you now we are a $24 million, but this is the first year that we do a $24 million in revenue.\nAnd we do believe and we are working hard where we want to see the profitability coming to see a reality and be profitable and be independent of the market. So we are working hard to execute on the business plan that I have detailed for you on the call to be able to achieve that profitability as soon as possible.\nPlease explain in detail why you believe March 15 was the best date to execute? There is a split note that you had a full 12 months to bring the company in best position for yourself. Why did you rush it?\nI mean, this is not a question that should be asked. I mean, we did not rush any of our split. We have our application filed with NASDAQ Capital Market, usually when a company files that the company does not go and just announce these things. So the shareholders are not aware of what they're doing to uplist the company to NASDAQ.\nWe filed the applications we have specific uplisting requirements including having a share price of above $3 to $4, depending on which category we fall into in the NASDAQ Capital Market initial listing requirements. And this is what we have done, we have started executing into meeting our initial requirements, and we will continue to meet them and if NASDAQ is satisfied and when tested [ph] as a top list.\nNext question, we are an unprofitable nano-cap company and your total compensation for 2017 including bonuses was $1.16 million, which is 13.2% of the annual revenues. Please explain why this compensation should be perceived as appropriate for shareholders?\nThis is a question that keeps being asked, right. I'm not sure where you're getting your numbers, but let me start first by saying that in 2013, when I started as a CEO of the company, we had zero cash in the bank. So I personally extended a $2.5 million line of credit that converted at $0.40 and I repeat it converted at $0.40 and did not take a salary for three years.\nI am sure you did not mind at that time, and you expect the CEO to continue to work provide cash and not be paid and work for you free. That I mean, the work doesn't function in that matter. And we have to understand we have to be realistic.\nIn addition, which is important here, and that can be confirmed by our findings with the SEC. I returned a large number of my RSUs to the company in 2016. I have not been issued any equity by the company since 2016. Three years, I haven't received a single share actually from the company. So if you think I'm overly paid I think you should actually go back and take what I've been paid over the six years I am been into the company.\nI received one cash bonus, since I started work in the company since 2013. And you have to be bothered by that fact and we brought all the financial and personal sacrifice that I personally suffered growing this company to $24 million of revenue.\nIn addition, please note that there is a vote on the management compensation every three years. And during the last vote the company received majority of vote from the shareholder on the pay. So I'm not actually clear where you got to a question that the shareholders did not approve that.\nSo if you believe honestly, that you can do a better job at running the company, please come forward I would be more than happy to present you to our Board of Directors so you can present your plan, how to run Innovus better than the current CEO and take us to profitability faster if you can do that. I'm actually getting pretty frustrated in part of those type of questions and this will be the last time that I will certainly entertain such questions.\nThe last question that's coming what are the ways average annual sales to reach profitability in other words where is breakeven point with regards to sales?\nI think it's important that this is something we do not disclose, this is proprietary information to the company, but definitely you will be able to see that from our future filings. So this is not something that we will disclose at this time.\nWe have one last question. How is the return on investment between the Canada and the U.S.?\nI think we've already covered that from the question of the analyst from Beth from that Zacks.\nThe last question that I received, can you actually discuss why Zacks downgraded you to a sell few days ago?\nAnd again, we did actually contact Zacks for that. And it was actually a glitch in the system when the symbol moved from INNV to INNVV after the reverse split for 30 days. And I believe that was actually corrected by their system. So we have not been downgraded by Zacks. This was a computer glitch that -- unfortunately that's happened at that time.\nSo with this, I believe this is the end of the questions that we have. Again, I would like to thank you for your continued support. And we look forward to update you again on our continuous growth and our efforts towards profitability for the company hopefully this year. Thank you very much and have a great day.\nOperator\nThe conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

(NASDAQ: FUV ) Q4 2018 Earnings 11:30 AM ET\nCompany Participants\nGreg Falesnik - Managing Director\nMark Frohnmayer - Founder, President and CEO\nConference Call Participants\nGreg Falesnik\nGood afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Arcimoto, Inc. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Webcast. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. This conference is being recorded today, April 1, 2019 and the press release accompanying this webcast was issued at the close of market today.\nAt this time, we will now play a brief corporate update review. Over to you, Mark.\nMark Frohnmayer\nGood afternoon everyone, good morning everyone on the West Coast. I've got to a little quick quarterly year long update video and we'll kick in through the slide presentation and open it up for Q&A.\n[Audio/Video Presentation]\nAll right, so before I dive into talking about the specifics of what we've been doing in Arcimoto over, really over the course of the last year and then the last quarter. Just a note, what we've really been doing from a market communication perspective, is beginning to tell the story of the platform. So, Arcimoto's mission to catalyze the shift to a sustainable transportation system really is all about going after the wide range of vehicles trips on the road that are overcapacity for vehicles that we use.\nAnd when we look at the market as a whole, it is a giant market, it's a giant problem and it's a giant opportunity. And we've really, we've looked at four different particular use cases that cover really a whole range of vehicle usage on-road. And the platform story is really all about using the same electromechanical platform to tackle each of those various problems and right sized the footprint of daily mobility. So one platform all electric, lighter footprint, more efficient by an order of magnitude in today's cars and cost effective, this is what took us many years to develop and it's what we have refined over eight generations of product development. It's an incredibly fun and compelling stable ride on the road, and yet very useful for a wide range of daily trips.\nOur market entry product is the Fun Utility Vehicle, the FUV. We are a consumer first brand. We -- the Company was started out of individuals, the individual desire to take part in a solution to sustainable mobility. And so, we think it is very important that our customers be able to make that choice and that we lead with that consumer focused brand. But ultimately, we see a wide range of commercial fleet opportunities as well.\nThe Rapid Responder, which is really just the FUV with blinky lights on it and supplies for emergency responders is a totally natural fit application for the platform and is something that we feel very strongly about that fleets particularly city fleets, emergency fleets, campus fleets have the opportunity to select much more efficient products that also do a better job of moving rapidly to emergency sites and so on.\nAnd then finally, where we really see just a giant opportunity is in last-mile delivery. So, this last couple of years, we've seen just massive investment go into food and grocery delivery. Opportunities, nearly every logistics company out there is looking at how to speed up delivery operations, so doing just in time delivery, same day delivery, and yet doing so more efficiently and with lower operating costs. And this is where we see the deliveries are fitting into just a huge number of opportunities on the road. This is for us and incredibly exciting product development.\nAnd again, between the Deliverator the Rapid Responder, and the Fun Utility Vehicle, we're estimating that more than 90% of the parts are going to stay the same between all of those different products. And by the way, for folks who have questions, there is a Q&A function in the interface, the zoom interface where you can put a question in, and we'll do Q&A right there at the end.\nAs we look to the future, the future is autonomous. And we see the Arcimoto platform as an ideal platform for autonomous driving for a giant chunk of the trips taken on the road today, about 80% of ride -- 85% of rideshare today is one passenger. And when you combine one in two passenger autonomous rideshare with last-mile delivery, that is where we see the Arcimoto platform really hitting the sweets spot in terms of utility, footprint and affordability with options for partnerships, with sensor suppliers, software vendors, building out that full stack for daily autonomy and transit.\nOur go-to market approach initially will be focused on direct experience in rental. So, the Fun Utility Vehicle, we're planning to have a 100 of those on the road starting next quarter. And some of those will go into our very first rental operations in Eugene and in Southern California. And the rental model for us is really just -- is a way of getting people, an experience of the vehicle, a really good experience of vehicle where you have a chance to actually drive it for a half a day or for a full day without having to have the pressure of a salesperson in the vehicle with you and where the outlets that actually offer rentals are themselves profitable enterprises.\nWe see vacation rental and tours as being sort of the first foray into that market, and then ultimately, we also see that the Fun Utility Vehicle is an ideal vehicle and ride sharing platform. We have moved from an empty building in at the time of our IPO to a functioning factory. We plan to kick off our first pilot production tomorrow. So, we are going to be actually -- where we have been doing station builds up until the end of this quarter where a full vehicle would be built on an individual station.\nStarting tomorrow, we will begin building vehicles in station -- in assembly station with starting at a 2-day takt time where the vehicles will move from station to station every two days where all the parts are there, ready to be put on the products and then vehicle goes out to the end of the door at the end of its time on the assembly line. And we're anticipating that 2-day takt time is going to be reduced to one day than a half a day than once every two hours, as we ramp up production speed and increase getting vehicles out the door.\nSo, our production targets really have not changed in terms of getting to a higher scale of production that is from a year from when we are starting production, we intend to be producing at 200 units per week production rates. We have slightly upped our, what we're anticipating our average sales price to be on account of the introduction of new products in the family. And we have seen a big jump in preorders over the last quarter versus the quarters before, which we see as indicative of market support for the imminence of production of the Arcimoto.\nAs we look over the long ramp, this is really just the beginning. The whole purpose of the getting the amp up and running, getting to a rate of 200 vehicles per week is to prove out a factory production model that we will then sale aggressively, opening new factories in, we intend to open another factory on the East Coast with the support of the advanced technology vehicle manufacturing program in the form of energy. And we're in discussions with folks actually in a number of locations all over the world about production of Arcimotos in other markets.\nAs we look at our Arcimoto as a whole, it's really all about being as efficient as we can possibly be improving out a globally scalable model, going after a massive opportunity. And I think you could see that in terms of our opportunistic and strategic capital raises over the course of the last year. The majority of which were done above market had strong insider support. And we see pursuing that same strategy including going after really the opportunity for non-dilutive financing for the big scale steps as we really aim to make a real impact on greenhouse gas emissions and the transportation sector as we know it.\nOr two goals for the next year, this is really where the rubber hits the road. So, we plan to deliver more than 400 evergreen addition FUVs. The opening -- once we are in production, we will be opening our rental locations, starting first in Oregon and California that putting in place our services and delivery network, and completing additional products based on the Arcimoto platform for much wider market opportunities. We'll also be fleshing out the full option set for the FUV and getting ready for higher scale production in 2020 and beyond.\nJust a quick note on the space as a whole, we have seen massive investments over the last year. At healthy valuations, we believe Arcimoto has a compelling and unique story to tell in this space. And then as we get into production, that's something that we will continue to do.\nAnd that about wraps it up for the planned remarks section, and again, go ahead and if you have questions, go ahead and put them in into the Q&A interface and I will be happy to answer them.\nA - Mark Frohnmayer\nEvery single electric vehicle manufacturer ends up, the actual step of developments into production for every EV maker is just a massive undertaking, I'm actually very proud of the performance of the team. It has been -- there have been lots of sticky wickets, lots of unknown unknowns, but we have been crushing through them really I think quite an impressive pace, and we are very excited to get production vehicles on the road.\nIn terms of selling the platform to others, yes, we -- the idea of the platform is it actually provides a platform that, that not only we but other manufacturers can customize and even individuals can customize to their particular needs on the road. We can envision vehicles suitable for contractors, vehicles suitable for a wide range of custom purposes where we would normally require a much larger footprint vehicle.\nThere was a report -- next question, there was a report out about recall the vehicles. Could you comment? Yes. So, over the -- we recall our beta fleet of vehicles, we had a number of issues that we discovered over the course of 2018, and we brought those vehicles back-in, in order to solve those issues. This was -- it was planned that the beta vehicles we're going to have things that we would work out and that has been very informative on the development of the product for the retail edition.\nNext question, as the initial 100 Evergreen series sold out. The initial 100 vehicles series, yes, we have the full evergreen, the full first 100 vehicles is now fully allocated. The Evergreens we plan to be selling the Evergreen through this year, but those first 100 that we're pushing to get on the road next this quarter are now fully allocated.\nAnd in terms of the next question, which is when do we anticipate moving to markets on the West Coast? We'll have a handful of our first 100 Evergreens out on to very early supporters out on an investor's out on the East Coast actually right after the turn of the quarter. We're still going to be very much focusing on West Coast delivery throughout the year. But we will be -- the plan is by quarter four to be opening up to two other areas of the country as well.\nQuestion, how do you differentiate yourself from Electra Meccanica SOLO, another three-wheel electric vehicle. While we should look at the SOLO as another product that that aims to satisfy a certain swath of the transportation marketplace, the differences between the FUV and the SOLO are primarily that the FUV carries two people, the SOLO to carries one. The FUV has dual motor front wheel drive. The SOLO has rear wheel drive on the single rear wheel.\nThe SOLO is designed much more as an automotive style product where the FUV has more of a motorcycle feel that has the ability to take the doors off, experience the air around you. And so in terms of which product is going to be more appropriate for you, if you're doing a lot of long distance commuting, you want an automotive feel and style, the Electra Meccanica might be the right product for you.\nIf you're traveling around with a friend to go out on a date or two, to hike or whatever, then the FUV would be a more appropriate choice. Both have awesome applications in rideshare. When we look at the delivery market, the Deliverator version of Arcimoto has a bit more storage space about double the storage space of the Electra Meccanica. So, we think that for certain delivery applications, it will be more appropriate choice.\nLet\u2019s see the next question. Is there a normalized scale on how many commercial sales are mixed into the personal use preorders? In other words, how severely will the preorders to be delayed as rentals and commercial usage vehicles are built. So, the query question, Arcimoto has always planned to have vehicles in market that early prospective customers can drive. So, we were always going to fold rent, initially, the plan was to do test drive outlets that the rental facilities are really just a more much more efficient way for us to do that.\nWe don't see the commercial opportunities really jumping line of our preorder customers. So, the preorder customers, we are saving your spot in line based on when you put down a $100 reservation. And then when we open up the region that you are in that opportunity will be preserved in the order that you are in the queue.\nIn terms of our commercial focused vehicles. The fleet focused vehicles like a Rapid Responder and the Deliverator. Those are peoples we have built one prototype of each. We do not plan to put those actually into full production until 2020. And those are going to be what helps build the scale of opportunity for 2020 as well as help drive on the cost through economies of scale. So, the commercial vehicles we see, is really actually a major win for our retail FUV customers as well.\nNext question is. What publicly available charging infrastructure can be used with the FUVs? The FUV has a standard J1772 level to charging plug. So any of the standard charging stations that you see all over the place, the charge points in the blinks and that have that standard J plug. Those all work with the FUV?\nNext question is. When will the rental locations be open? The plan is to reopen the geolocation commensurate with when we deliver the very first retail series, FUVs, which will we are targeting for this quarter. And we expect that the San Diego location will be open, if not at exactly the same time then very shortly thereafter.\nThe next question is do you have motorcycle license to drive the FUV? The answer is that varies by state. In our initial focus states of Oregon and California, no motorcycle license is required. Currently in Washington State, you need a motorcycle license to operate it. And you can actually take that motorcycle endorsement tests using the Fun Utility Vehicle. So, we are going state by state, working in states where the laws require a motorcycle endorsement and saying hey, look, this vehicle has it -- the learning curve is about 30 seconds. It's a stable platform vehicle. You don't need to know how to ride a two wheeler in order to pilot it. And we found very good reception that message so far.\nNext question, can you talk a little bit more about autonomy? Is the plan to provide the platform for the companies to integrate cameras, lidar, radar and their software platforms? Or do you have your own plans? It's really -- it\u2019s a mix of both. So, we are going -- we plan to do a baseline implementation of an Arcimoto autonomous vehicle with partners. We expect to be heavily engaged in the integration step of that. And we are also plan to open the platform and sell the platform to folks who want to use it for their own autonomous fleets software and the full software in center stack that they're developing.\nNext question is. Can you tell us about the federal loan program that you're applying for? And how important is the overall strategy of the Company? The ATVM loan program is the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing loan program. We're in the early stages still of applying with federal government for that money. It is a program that was constituted in order to further development and manufacturer of advanced technology vehicles and ultra-efficient vehicles. And in terms of how important is it to us our overall strategy, we don't -- we're not counting on it until it is, it is an approved application and is it is money that will be coming into the bank.\nBut it is one example of a non-dilutive capital source that would allow us to dramatically increase production scale here in the U.S. And it would be in terms of whether that happens before or after potential joint ventures and overseas production that would have essentially the same characteristics in terms of non-dilutive large scale capital really remains to be seen. But right now what we're building is, is really the argument and demonstrating the true market potential that justifies those sorts of capital formation activities.\nThe next question is. How many preorders do you now have? We reported at the end of the quarter that we have 3,883 orders, that's up from I believe honestly 3,200 and change at the end of at the end of Q4. So, we saw an acceleration in preorders over the last quarter and we actually expected that acceleration. The peers will continue to accelerate as we actually begin delivering vehicles in the market as we open up our visual locations and as we really fleshed out the whole product family on the road for our commercial customers.\nMark Frohnmayer\nAll right, well, thank you all for joining us today. 2018 was a pivotal and transformational year for Arcimoto. After more than a decade of development, we are now really on the cusp of production starts. We're starting to do our pilot production tomorrow. We're still working through a variety of testing and final regulatory compliance issues. At the conclusion of which, we will begin delivering for the first time Fun Utility Vehicles to our retail customers.\nWe have expanded this quarter our offerings from one product to three to hit a much wider swath of the overall market place including rapid response, local last mile delivery. And we believe that Arcimoto is positioned very well in this rapidly changing transportation space to make a meaningful difference by right sizing the footprint of daily mobility.\nI am very proud of all that our team has accomplished. This transition from product development to production is a huge hurdle for every EV endeavor and our team's ingenuity and really passionate commitment to developing a true sustainable mobility solution as well as the incredible support that we have received from our stakeholders that has powered us through to this next step. It's been critical and it's allowed us to get to the point where we're truly on the verge of beginning to address urban congestion and climate change.\nAnd so, thank you again for participating and we'll next you next time.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mark frohnmayer", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "greg falesnik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "arcimoto, inc.", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "arcimoto, inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "arcimoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west coast", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T03:18:51.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "295023d959c96f0e3a945fd9adb88f095ad7e7be", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4252210-imageware-systems-inc-iwsy-ceo-jim-miller-q4-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript", "site_full": "seekingalpha.com", "site": "seekingalpha.com", "site_section": "http://www.seekingalpha.com/feed.xml", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "mutual_funds"], "section_title": "All Articles on Seeking Alpha", "title": "ImageWare Systems, Inc.

Please go ahead, sir.\nWayne Wetherell\nThank you, operator, and welcome to those of you joining our call today. Our financial results are available in the recently published news release and on form 10-K. For context on today's call, I will provide a brief summary of those results.\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $4.4 million compared to $4.3 million for 2017. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $1.1 million compared to $1.2 million for the same quarter of 2017. Revenue for both years primarily reflects our legacy business. Gross profits for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $3.5 million as compared with $3.3 million in 2017. Gross margins increased to 80% in 2018 compared to 77% in 2017. Gross profit for the quarter was $906,000 as compared to $975,000 in the same quarter of 2017. Gross margins for the quarter increased to 85% compared to 80% in 2017. The 2018 net loss from continuing operations was $12.5 million as compared to $10.2 million for 2017. The fourth quarter net loss from continuing operations was $3.1 million compared to $2.4 million for the same quarter of 2017. We ended the year with $5.7 million in cash.\nThis concludes my financial summary, and I'll now turn the call over to Jim the progress update of our business strategy.\nJim Miller\nThanks Wayne, good afternoon to all. I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to speak with you all today. Most of you on this call have been on our calls before, and you're already familiar with our technology overview and with what our patented multimodal biometric technology does how it's different from and superior to, other competing technologies and why it's needed. For anyone who would like to drill down into that information one-on-one, our investor relations team is available to speak with you or you can visit our updated Web site at iwsinc.com, which I think you'll find extremely informative.\nSpeaking of biometric technology, you may have seen last week's Wall Street Journal story about the growing use of biometrics in the workplace and workers' concerns about the security of the data when companies gather employee fingerprints and retina scans. Continued data breaches like the very recent problem with FEMA have begun to frustrate the mass-market. But this type of news only strengthens the ImageWare value proposition. We are the only company that offers true anonymous biometric security. We do this by employing a technique we developed and patented to separate biometric matching from personal information, so that in the remote event of any security issue an intruder would only have access to useless biometric templates without knowing who they belong to. With our portfolio of patents 22 issued and 25 pending for cloud based anonymous storage, transmission and matching of multimodal biometrics, only ImageWare can provide the ultimate level of authentication assurance and security.\nI'd like to take a minute from the formal presentation to point out what is fundamentally different about the inventory of today as compared with the image of the past few years. We've always known and as I believe that our long-time investors do that ImageWare was ahead of its time with a very powerful best-of-breed scalable and patented biometric technology. The important question for all of this was could this technology become a successful business. As you may have seen in the two recent 8-K filing announcements that question no longer exists. The business from our partnership with Contactable with the mobile communications carrier put ImageWare on a path to profitability. And there are a handful of new transactions in the pipeline that we expect to announce in the second quarter. As to the question of why this is happening now, well in three years we've struggled to close deals. Well, our answer is that we aren't doing things very much differently and we haven't come-up with a magic formula.\nWhat has happened is that the market, the biometric authentication market has begun to catch-up with us. Identity is the new security perimeter. Throughout the world companies and governments spent billions of dollars to install firewalls, threat detection systems and other products that protect the perimeter of their network. But having spent those collective billions we're still left with the fact that's reported by Verizon. 8% of all security breaches are the result of compromised passwords and pins. So, they don't work. And on top of it all, those passwords and pins are not easy to use or remember, and we change them with incredible frequency.\nWith the introduction of the IWS Digital Identity platform, we now have all the products integrated together, which allow the customer to create a digital identity, fully vetted against the government issued document, use it thereafter for reliable biometric authentication and manage that identity through its lifecycle, all from one vendor, ImageWare. The need for this digital identity platform is finally being understood and addressed and our value proposition and message are finally resonating in the market. That makes for a huge difference, and it's here now.\nNow, I'll focus on what we and our partners are doing in terms of our sales efforts. On February 8th, we filed an 8-K, which disclose that we had entered into a definitive agreement with a global financial services provider to provide multimodal biometric authentication solutions for a healthcare application. Under the agreement, our GoVerifyID mobile biometric solution will be part of the system used to help ensure compliance with mandates under the 21st Century Cures Act, which require states to implement Electronic Visit Verification, or EVV, for patients, which will create a digital record of the care provider and authenticate the care provider and the patient.\nOur new customer is set to begin his use of the system in May. EVV is mandated by federal law for personal care services provided under Medicare. It will be expanded over the next several years as mandatory for home care services provided under Medicare. Using both biometrics and GPS on a laptop or mobile device, our product creates a digital record of the caregiver, the patient, the address visited and it allows access to electronic medical records, which can be detected to be protected under HIPAA by biometric authentication.\nLast quarter, we told you we entered into a license agreement with Contactable, a partner of ours whose products allow for the creation of a person's digital identity starting with vetting that identity against a validly issued government identity document, such as a driver's license or a passport. Earlier this year, Contactable entered into a five-year agreement with ImageWare to resell our biometric products, which have been fully integrated as part of their offering. On March 18th, our 8-K filing disclosed that through Contactable ImageWare has been awarded a contract to provide the biometric authentication as part of the services provided to a major multinational mobile telecommunications company. The initial phase of the agreement is for a region, which has approximately 30 million mobile customers with additional phases anticipated. Contactable will provide the IWS multimodal biometric engine for the biometric authentication.\nWhile I'm precluded from discussing price points for the moment, the size of the contract will yield material results for IWS as we move through the various phases of implementation. The mobile carrier will use biometrics for such things as mobile payment authentication, fraud detection and prevention, et cetera. The carrier will have a mandatory phase-in period for all existing customers and of course biometrics will become the new standard operating procedure for all new customers. Our partner will start their deployment in the second quarter and we will follow on in the second half of this year. This particular carrier has several hundred million subscribers worldwide, so this opportunity is expected to be a game changer for our company.\nAs important, it delivers a key ingredient to us we've been lacking. While we have world-class references in our government space, such as the Canadian Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Veterans Administration and State of Arizona, we've lacked those large references in our private sector business and now we'll have them. As we stated in the past, mobile carriers are a perfect user for our products and we look forward to concluding deals with other mobile carriers this year. I'm catching you up on previously discussed deals and projects. Our partners at CDW closed eight deals for our GoVerifyID enterprise product in 2018. Most all were for employees of small credit union. Of course this how one moves from small groups of employees to larger groups of credit union customers. CDW tells us that it expects to significantly increase the number of these deals in 2019. We're very excited about our partnership with ForgeRock, a leading player in the identity management space who has integrated our GoVerifyID product and our identity proofing into ForgeRock's products. Our two companies will kick-off their joint marketing and sales of these products to ForgeRock customers at their U.S. national sales event in Nashville, Tennessee on April 30th.\nOn the Fujitsu front, we continue our work with Fujitsu and their partners on securing a large reference account for the MedClick product, which you'll recall is a private labeled version of our pillphone application. We're in the process of the initial deployment for the Canadian financial institution, which we sold in last year's Q3 with Fujitsu's and we continue to support Fujitsu's efforts as they work with ServiceNow to introduce a new version of a HelpDesk product, which using biometric authentication will make HelpDesk both more efficient and more secure. This effort has been a long path to travel but we continue to see evidence of why it continues to be worthy effort as it makes its way toward deployment. IBM selected ImageWare to work with them to create the biometric authentication software for the next generation Canada TSA restricted access identity control product. This is a $2.8 million order. We generated our first revenues in our Q4 from that effort, and we have just completed another milestone, which will generate revenue in our quarter one. We continue to anticipate completion of this entire project in this calendar year.\nThe question of our need for capital has been asked by a number of shareholders if we decide to raise capital to help speed our growth and strengthen our balance sheet. We believe that capital is available from existing shareholders who would like to increase their ownership. We've also semi regularly receive questions about the 2-plus million share short position in our stock and about making sure they gain in IWSY. But I thought you'd like to know that one of our stockholders has recently taken action by contacting the SEC to request an inquiry to naked short selling in our stock, asking that action to be taken against the people and companies involved in these security violations. These regulatory wheels typically drive slowly, and we'll keep you posted of any future developments. But suffice it to say that we'll all be very happy to have naked shorting stop.\nAnd one last thing before we turn to questions and I've said this before but it's important to say it again. The process we take with each partner and potential customer is unique to that specific partner or customer. Each has its own set of objectives, market forces, processes but these would be navigated prior to going to market. Sometimes these processes especially involving very large companies move the regulation pace but they are in fact all moving forward towards very large markets as evidenced by our two most recent 8-K filings for agreements, the logjam has finally been broken and the market is exploding.\nAnd now, I'd like to turn over for any questions you might have.\nOperator\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Paul Penney of Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nPaul Penney\nWith respect to your two 8-K customers, can you give us more detail on number one, when they'll be starting the pay and show-up on the statements. Secondly, when you will be able to name them by name, and three, can you give us just a bit more detail in terms of their willingness to be a reference customer for future growing RFPs?\nJim Miller\nThanks Paul for the question, let me see if I can do them let me do it in reverse order, if I could. As to reference, emphatically yes. As you know and as I just alluded to in my remarks that has been one major thing we believe that has eluded us. Nobody likes to be first. People are much better at being 3rd or 4th, particularly when it comes to adoption of a security product. So we have that in place now. And yes, both companies are very happy to have this and be referenceable for us and for them. They both the companies involved are making their way to their own public disclosure of the deals in the healthcare space that will come as we go to full production deployment in the initial state, which is now scheduled end of April, 1st of May. They are finishing up their final integration of our product into theirs and doing their tests and checks. And we will be on to that and it's our understanding that they'll announce that when it's out for deployment.\nSimilarly, I know that with our partner and the telecommunications company, they are actually working out the details as we speak of what would be an announcement about this. So we would expect that'll be out there fairly shortly. It's a little frustrating for us too, as you can imagine. But in both these cases, we act effectively as subcontractor. So the rules of the road are set by our prime or by our ultimate customer, and the penalties are too big to avoid compliance with that. So, we stay with the agreements we made.\nIn terms of on-boarding, similar thing, the healthcare should start in May. And when it does that as people come onto the system, it's a software-as-a-service model. So it will yield per person per month revenue. We go into the billing cycle and the turnaround, so we're expecting to start generating those revenues in May on the healthcare one.\nOn the telecommunications went a little bit different there again, we're effectively a subcontractor to the contract holders, which is our partner Contactable. They'll be starting work at the end of April this year. And so, we'll be coming on after them. But I think effectively what that's going to mean is more in the after the June timeframe, because they need to set up some things and get their on-boarding put into place. You can't have biometric authentication until those digital identities are created and successfully put in the database. The good news is, as I said in my remarks, this is mandatory program, it's not optional. So, all the subscribers in the system are going to be pushed onto the system. So a couple of different use cases with different paths to revenue, but that's how we're looking right now for it.\nQ - Paul Penney\nAnd then can you give more detail on your progress with some of your retailers, you alluded to Fujitsu and some of the others you've had for some time? Is there anything you're doing to maybe better engage them or motivate them to actively sell the product and yes, and what you're on that?\nJim Miller\nI think one of the things that we're seeing happily is that, we've called on quite a few companies and partners. We've had quite a few partnerships with folks now. And one of the things that people have been saying is when they initially partnered up they didn't have a complete understanding of the market. So they've had to do a little learning, that old saying, you don't know what you don't know. And then when know it, you are way smarter, because it isn't just a lesson someone else told you've actually lifted and learned it yourself. So we've seen a number of these companies come back to us now. So folks like, for example CA, who we started and stopped now back we engaged with a new freshness into the partnership, which we're excited about. Similarly with Fujitsu our longest and oldest partner, I think has spent a fair amount of times, trying to figure out how to move these products to market, where we belong in a complex eco-structure called Fujitsu Corporate\nYou also have to navigate around the changes in personnel, which we've had a few of. But we have gone back to each and every one of the signed partnerships and a couple over the ones where we had engaged in conversation, and we're pretty gratified and excited by the reaction we're seeing. Folks who'd waved it off or folks who'd even entered a partnership agreement but just couldn't quite figure out how to get to market. I think part of that was they were in the same place we're in that was we're early to market. And now that market is turning around for all the reasons we know and discuss, the security issues in the world have not abated, they're not going to abate. They're only getting worse and so they are now finally demanding actions. So a number of these partners now are re-engaging back with us, maybe more importantly than us reengaging with them, because that shows us that they have a desire and an interest in getting this thing going at last.\nSo we're in, we've got a pretty broad array. As I said, the ones that we have reported and a whole bunch of ones that we have tried to make partners in previous attempts but didn't are now coming back and we're in those discussions about those partners. So I think there's really a fundamental change that's gone on the marketplace that's driven all this interest. And the good news is we'll be the big beneficiaries of that.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Harvey Kohn with HRK Strategic Advisory. Please go ahead.\nHarvey Kohn\nI appreciate, and I'm pretty excited about the multitude of contracts that we are currently working on. And my two questions were partly answered if you think that they were fully answered, you can just move on. But they involve the two large contracts that we recently announced the two 8-Ks, and the first one. I wonder if you could give us a little bit more clarity and color on how that helps your product work, what does it do in terms of security, why is it needed in that healthcare area? And the second question is, we talked about the telecommunications company, and depending on where we're looking and reading. We're talking about a huge range or an implementation of I don\u2019t know $30 million or $40 million, if I can use that number. And my question will be that assuming those hypothetical users, what period of time are we talking about. I mean these are not, as you said, these are mandatory sign-on. So my question would be is that $30 million in a year once they start or $30 million in a month, or five years or what's the timeframe for that?\nJim Miller\nAs I said, we are not the main contract holder. We are provider to the main contract holder. You need to get digital identities vetted and created first before biometric authentication goes to work, so there's a little fundamental foundational work, I'll call it that goes on before we get involved. In terms of how many people can be added to the system, tens of thousands or in excess of that can be added in a single day to be candid, I don't think anybody's ever on-boarded a system of this size in the private sector in this way. So it's a little bit of new territory for all of us. But assuming that the carrier does its part to ensure that the ultimate end users are mandatorily put on the system, let's put it that way. There's no reason why you couldn't add thousands and thousands of hundreds of thousands of people over real short periods of time. So that's how it sets up. I wish I had an exact date, time and place a number for you, but the fact that of the matter is that we don't have a historical record in this context to go off. So I just don't have that.\nIn terms of the healthcare deal, it\u2019s really exciting. I think it's a perfect use case for biometric authentication. It's one that we have modeled internally here well before this deal came to pass. First of all, I think what folks should understand that it's federally mandated. That is that the notion of electronic visit verification mandated by federal legislation called the 21st Century Cures Act, which requires the states to implement an EVV program for all personal care services supply them to Medicare. And that is a mandatory deadline of January 1, 2020. The services are expanded to include all home health care and that mandatory deadline is in 2023. And there are penalties or non-compliance every year from now until then. So that there is a perfect storm situation, if you will where the government is creating the mandatory piece of this puzzle so this is an elective.\nAll states in the country are going have to go on to this program. And very simply what it does our GoVerifyID program uses biometric authentication to authenticate the healthcare provider it will also authenticate the patient as that's required. And it will use GPS to give you a location of where the care was provided in terms of a physical address, as well as a digital date and timestamp. So it really creates the perfect record. More importantly, it creates the record required by the federal law and we are pretty excited by it. Again, mandatory programs going to be used by all the states. Our particular customer is going to roll it out in one designated state. They have a number of other states also under agreement. So that has started as one and rolled down the road with them to others. And is it replicatable? Yes, emphatically yes. Could it be used by other providers in the space? Emphatically, yes. So again, there is a big opportunity here and we have a ready product for it. We have a customer for it. And we believe there are other customers out there as well.\nOperator\nThe question comes from Elliot Knight of Knight Advisors. Please go ahead.\nElliot Knight\nJim, a year ago on the conference call, you said let's spend a minute reviewing how ImageWare generates its revenue, and you went through it with numbers. Those numbers may have changed. And I wondered if you could update your statements explaining and outlining how the company is rewarded for its software?\nA - Jim Miller\nThere we have two models that we are at work with right now, one for our legacy business, which is mostly government, state, local, some federal clients and that model works traditional old school software. There's, generally speaking, some upfront license that is purchased. And then the recurring revenue is most often in the form of maintenance and support, which typically run anywhere from 15% to 20% of the original total of the contract. And so that's one. The second one, which we have been moving toward in our private space products with GoVerifyID, particularly is software-as-a-service. So we will be paid an agreed on price per person using the system every month that they use it. So again, very typical software-as-a-service model, transformational potential for our financials, because you will read yourself from the one-time peak and then you go into the valley, which is really periodic maintenance payments in favor of every month you're getting paid for supplying your service.\nAnd, that's what these two deals that were announced are also important to keep in mind, because they are that model software-as-a-service per person per month. And it's also possible to price things transitionally per month as well. So when I say per person per month, you should also think there's a possibility and we've got folks we're in conversation with who want to do this per transaction. Every time someone comes on the system and uses biometric authentication, there is a fee paid for that service. If they come on 12 times in a month, that fee will be multiplied times 12 so again, transformational potential for the financial aspects of our company. And we're also by the way seeing some initial positive and really hopeful signals from government. They are changing their historical bias against software-as-a-service and moving quite frankly in step with all the industry, most all the software that you can think of is either sold in hours or headed rapidly to the software as a service model.\nAnd again, very hopeful signs that we've had some government customers reach out and ask for pricing based on our software-as-a-service model, which would be just absolutely awesome development for us to move our government customers on to that. So that's how we do it, those two models that's how it's priced, volume impacts price. The price points can be anywhere from $1.20, to $1.40, to $1.50 first in a month down to $0.50 or $0.60. Again, it's all negotiated. It's all dependent on volume. It won't shock you to know that the more people that are on the system, the better the price gets. So that's how it works.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Jeffrey Link of Invemed Associates. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Link\nThe question after we have met back in December one of the areas I was trying to focus on was the sales side. And I don't if you're able to talk today about what you're doing in terms of adding sales personnel to make sure that you're able to meet the demand of all these RFPs and interest that you're now receiving.\nJim Miller\nWe are actively looking as we speak for additional experienced folks in software as a service area. We've added one individual, very accomplished veteran in SaaS business executive sales personnel here that has joined the company just in the last couple of weeks. We will be adding a couple more, both for domestic and international markets as well. So it's an active process. We've moved some believe folks around since you visited with us and we've added one new key sales executive on sales staff. And by that I mean active outselling not management, but actually day-to-day selling and we'll be adding a couple of more here in a very short timeframe. You identified the need with a lot of interest and we need to put a few more folks on making sure that interest gets created to deals and therefore revenue.\nJeffrey Link\nJust a question about non-competes when you land a deal like the Contactable landed that cellular company or the deal with the home health care services company. Are they asking that you don't sell to any of their competitors? Are you able to open this up to folks within that industry, or they give you any restrictions?\nJim Miller\nNo, the short answer is no. These are non-exclusive deals. I will tell you that from time-to-time folks don't ask. But the answer has historically been no and for the foreseeable future, probably will be the same. And part of that Jeff is some of our already pre-existing contracts with our partners, so to speak, that ship has kind of sailed. Exclusivity has already been out of the possible, because we have large parts of the world under contract with partners like Fujitsu, where they can already have the right to resell the product, and in any vertical market. So no. But again the short answer is no. We're big believers in non-exclusivity and the product plays well in lots of spaces with lots of different customers so we have so far been pretty successful in making sure the contracts are non-exclusive.\nOperator\nNext question comes from Brad Watson with the Watson Company. Please go ahead.\nBrad Watson\nI'm just wondering if ImageWare has ever considered selling to another company in terms of being taken over by a larger company with more resources, maybe Microsoft or Apple or one of the bigger telecommunications companies like AT&T or Sprint that has more resources to better leverage the product that ImageWare has to offer, particularly with the mobile identification, companies like AT&T who have hundreds of millions of customers rather than just 10 million or 5 million, or something like that?\nJim Miller\nWe do we do look at that as that possibility. I think it would be irresponsible for certainly a public company to not bear that in mind. But I will say to you what I think I've said before publicly and what we've certainly said here internally. With 50.1% of our shareholders decided to put the company for sale and to actually sell it, then that's what we're going to do, whether someone likes me or anybody else agrees or not, frankly. But we're always -- I think and I've said this before too, I think the outcome of success is eventually the possibility or the probability of what you're suggesting. As you're successful in lining up these contract, as you are successful in introducing the new model successfully, as you move to profitability and those metrics, you will attract folks who want to own it. And absolutely again when the shareholders are ready to do that our management is ready to do it too.\nBrad Watson\nI noticed that Neil Goldman is one of the major shareholders for the company. Is there something that you've discussed with him at all? Is this something that the board of directors have the actual conversations about? Or is Goldman really the guy that really decides all the stuff since he is the majority shareholder, or it's just been talks about the shareholders perhaps maybe get it done?\nJim Miller\nMr. Goldman is a Member of Board, he is the largest shareholder. The decision is made by the whole group of shareholders, not just any one person. And again, we have discussions at the Board level as appropriate. So if there is someone who has indicated interest then of course we will discuss it, and with an absolute open mind, by the way. I mean, the idea is to make these decisions in best interest of all the shareholders, not just one group or one person. So, we act that way as appropriately.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from John Gruber with Gruber and McBaine. Please go ahead.\nJohn Gruber\nI just wondered what's if things go right, what was the two contracts, what will be the revenue in the second half of '19 and in '20 and the year of '20 from those two contracts?\nJim Miller\nJohn, I'd like to answer that question for you, but I really can\u2019t. It's part of our agreements with both of those companies. We've been told that we're really not at liberty to discuss the price point in that at least now\u2026\nJohn Gruber\nI didn't ask the price point, I just asked for the revenue that will be reported\u2026\nJim Miller\nRight absolutely, and they clearly will. But we are not in a position today to put out a projection, which you are asking for revenue on these two over those time frames that you suggested. I just don't know. It's not that I have it sitting here with them. I'm not willing to share. We just don't know it.\nJohn Gruber\nSecond question is can you give us any sense of what the, since like this is March quarter is over. What the rough revenue was in the March quarter given that we've been stuck in this $1.1 million, $1.2 million a quarter for heck of a long time?\nWayne Wetherell\nThis is Wayne. We have not provided any forward-looking statements on our financial results, and it wouldn't be appropriate for us to at this time. We'll be coming out with our financials on the first quarter fairly soon.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Dan [Kaplan], a Private Investor. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst\nFirst of all, I have a comment and then a question. Thank you for your presentation and your recent progress. However, for several quarters, investors have been routinely told the cash flow breakeven was just a quarter away. These are net projections can negatively impact the degree of confidence for shareholders and in management. You are the stewards of our hard earned money, the ones we entrust for a favorable return on our investments. It's time for shareholders to have the opportunity for face-to-face interactions with ImageWare's management and director. This will allow shareholders to get a closer sense of who you are, enhancing the level of optimism and trust. Will you make a commitment that a notice will be made within 30 days to announce the date for an Annual Shareholder Meeting?\nJim Miller\nThanks for your question, Dan. We'll certainly make the commitment, I don't know if I can do it or we can do it within 30 days. But we certainly agree with your statement that it's an appropriate thing to do and so no problem committing to do.\nOperator\nThis concludes time allocated for the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Miller for any closing remarks.\nJim Miller\nThanks Janie. As you look around our industry and where it fits in our world changes afoot. And life for this business changes hardly ever immediate or swift, it's time consuming and often painful. And results when the pain seeks to alleviate has reached a boiling point can no longer be tolerated, forcing change in habits and behavior. The mobile phones, colored televisions and personal computer, staples in today's everyday life. We're not anywhere near immediate hit, taking many years to be adopted by the mass consumer market. So it is in the identity authentication space. For ImageWare, we are seeing that change in real time, folks who over the past several years were not ready, or interested in securing their identity biometrically, are now realizing finally that the multiple levels of pain of multi-billion dollar data breaches can no longer be tolerated.\nThe market is finally catching up to us. They're also realizing that for the collective billions paid in network protection it has not alleviated the problem. Identity is the new security and as that reality takes hold, ImageWare and its investors will reach significant benefits. As always, we very much appreciate your continued support, as well as your taking time for today's call. And we look forward to speaking with you on our next one. I wish everyone very good afternoon or good evening.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines.

Mr. Tienor, you may begin.\nJason Tienor\nThank you. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us for this afternoon's 2018 year end earnings call. We understand that you've been waiting patiently for a summary of our 2018 full year performance as well as an update on our ongoing activities with ROTH Capital Partners. We appreciate your continued interest and support of Telkonet and are eager to share our progress with you this far.\nI believe that we're all fully aware of many of the macroeconomic difficulties that businesses experienced throughout 2013 year. Closer to home Telkonet realized substantial impacts due to a number of these negative market forces. The implementation of Chinese tariffs throughout the year not only had a negative impact on overall revenue through delayed customer purchases caused by higher production costs, but also had a dramatic impact on our gross margin due to an inability to pass the increased costs onto our market.\nWhile this is not unique to Telkonet as a small but growing technology company, these impacts take a toll on our fragile growth initiatives. 2018 also saw an industry-wide shortage of technology components with far reaching impacts across the manufacturing sector. Due to limited availability and increased pricing, our logistics required us to increase volume purchasing in order to lock-in product as well as pay the increased prices when necessary due to competitive pressures. This also saw product lead times for a long lead items reach as far out as 10 months requiring extensive planning and placing pressure on quarterly shipments. As of today, we've not seen signs of this pressure waning either.\nAnother impact of the full year performance was the difficulty in achieving peak operating capacity due to a shortage in the qualified workforce. While this also is not unique to Telkonet, it bears mentioning that we're currently in a period of rampant growth and this impact is felt on a daily basis everywhere from our production facility and logistics department to our operations personnel.\nLastly having undertaken a strategic industry review early in 2018 a significant amount of resources were spent on activities not involved with revenue generating projects. While this was taken on for valuable reasons, overall it continues to have an impact on the performance of the company. With all of this being said and while 2018 may not appear to have the growth year that it was through our financial filings, we truthfully experienced an enormous level of success throughout the year on a number of measures that positioned us firmly for a better 2019.\nOur early results in the first three months of the year have demonstrated our efforts success and we're excited about what it will mean for the full year of 2019. By 2018 revenues, we have shown a flat year-over-year performance, but our sales activity was anything, but while entering the year with less than $0.5 million in backlog resulted in sales of just over $8.4 million in minimal revenue growth. Our sales activity resulted in a record year of more than $10 million in new sales and carrying more than $4 million in backlog and an additional $1.7 million in verbal commitments into 2019.\nThis volume activity was driven by consistently rising quarter-over-quarter performance in 2018 that has continued into 2019 as well. Not only are we seeing trending record sales volumes and growth, but we're also seeing significant increases in recurring revenues with growth of 69% for 2018 over 2017. A large reason for the extensive sales growth in 2018 was the increase in activity of our channel partners.\nWith more than 69% of our annual sales performed by these channel partners, we're finally reaping the benefits of our sales and marketing efforts over the last several years to cultivate these sales channels. Additionally, another significant indicator of this valuable partner channel growth is that the increased growth in backlog is due to the large volume of partner projects initiated by existing relationships and providing early entry into new developments and early construction projects. This increased visibility into future periods as well as the entire company excited about the 2019 fiscal year.\n2018 also saw the successful completion of several projects, several years in the making. The first of these was the award of the first of several potential residential projects being deployed across military bases. Working with one of the nation's largest [SCO's] [ph], Telkonet was able to market, sell engineering and deploy $1 million project that is one of the largest in the company's history and was the first of its kind in the residential market.\nThis project is also the first of several potential phases which provides ongoing revenue potential as well as expanded product and service sales to existing and new projects within this relationship. While minimal product had shipped during 2018, the first large tranche of products shipped recently in Q1 totaling more than 2800 units. Because of this first project a second project was recently awarded with the first product shipping within the first quarter as well. This relationship and the associated opportunities were developed over the last four years with the first responses to requests taking place in 2016 and the first award happening in 2018.\nAn entirely new product and application was developed specifically for this customer with the intentions for further development and integration and expanding the offering and support services extensively. Additional testing is currently take place to expand the first deployment into phase two. Another example of the extensive effort deployed towards some of the company's largest wins is the recently announced Hilton Connected Room Initiative, is the first of [I] [ph] certified to work within the connected room. We've been in development and testing with Hilton for more than two years. As one of only two providers certified to work within this franchise wide initiative. Telkonet is in the enviable position of participating in the deployment of this brand wide standard for more than 5000 properties over the next several years.\nThrough the close relationship developed and having been installed within the internal corporate demonstrations and several first trial properties, we also were able to recognize several valuable opportunities within the Hilton Connected Room program and engineer multiple products designed to fulfill those opportunities and create significant value within our target markets. Since that time we've been able to expand on the market potential for these new products and expect to see significant gain both in their offering and integration within our platform.\nAs you can see by the performance of 2018 from a sales perspective. The company is positioned for a banner year in early activity has already proved to be true. The longstanding efforts to win large projects and grow an unbelievable channel program have borne fruit and are successfully yielding results. Our ability to provide visibility to record backlog and a vibrant sales channel has positioned the company comfortably for meeting its forecasts and goals for 2019 moving forward.\nNow as our performance as demonstrated, Telkonet's technology and market penetration continue to strengthen our position as a leader in our target markets and our technology platform is a prominent stat for automation and IoT solutions. These developments have generated a growing level of interest in our marketing and sales activities as the industry interests and end user experience, energy savings and complete solutions expands, because we've witnessed the maturation of the IoT industry early on, we recognize that the opportunity -- to recognize more significant gains in both platform and revenue growth could be increased through evaluating available strategic market synergies.\nDue to this, we evaluated a number of investment think partnerships and ultimately chose ROTH Capital Partners to provide a strategic market analysis of potential transactions that might increase Telkonet's shareholder value. Through this exercise, we've been introduced to a large number of interested parties and participated in numerous presentations and discussions that have yielded a variety of opportunities and early results.\nIn addition to executing a number of strategic partnerships through technology integrations and market opportunities, we've been participating in ongoing negotiations regarding a number of potential strategic transactions of various types. Obviously, Telkonet's strategic value in these conversations is a matter of substantial interest and the significance of Telkonet's position as a public company carries a variety of difficulties due to the requirement of receiving shareholder approval for any type of transaction.\nAs you can imagine moving through this process there are inert difficulties for an interested party in negotiating a transaction that has no certainty until after Telkonet moves through a complete proxy process to getting shareholder approval. And working with ROTH, we continue to manage through this process and our ongoing discussions and look forward to having additional information to share very soon.\nAs we've just completed our 2019 first quarter yesterday with extremely positive results, we look forward to our upcoming Q1 earnings call on May 15 and soon after 2019 shareholder meeting on May 23. I would ask that you watch for your upcoming shareholder proxy for additional information regarding our ongoing negotiations and activities and make sure to vote your proxy in all items noted as well as encourage any fellow Telkonet's shareholders to do the same.\nAs I mentioned earlier, while 2018 financial performance may not portray the success that we saw throughout the year, its activities have positioned us for a successful 2019 and we've already experienced this traction in Q1. Based on our early success, a substantial backlog and expanding pipeline, our strong channel partner performance in our ongoing markets successes, we see the framework for a fantastic year and the expansion of the strategic opportunities currently ahead of us.\nWe truly appreciate your continued interest and look forward to answering any questions you might have.\nWith that, I'd like to hand the call over to Gene Mushrush, Telkonet's Chief Financial Officer for a review and the quarterly financial performance with you.\nGene Mushrush\nThank you, Jason. Ladies and gentlemen good afternoon and welcome.\nToday I will be presenting our 2018 year end financial summary. For the year ended December 31, 2018, total revenues grew approximately 2% to $8.4 million compared to last year. Recurring revenues grew 69% to approximately $816,000 during the current year. A decline in non-recurring educational revenues was offset by a similar increase in hospitality revenues. The majority of our revenues are transactional base which are influenced by circumstances such as scope, timing and budgets resulting in year-over-year variations.\nYou may recall on January 1, 2018, the company adopted Accounting Standards Codification topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers was superseded nearly all legacy revenue recognition guidance. ASC 606 outlined a revenue model based on when control of promised goods or services are transferred by an entity to a customer. The company concluded the most significant impact versus past guidance related to the timing of revenue recognition for contracts with single combined obligations. For these contracts revenues recognized at points in time in the past would not be recognized over a course of time based upon a percentage of completion metric.\nThe impact of new standard had on current year-to-date revenues when compared to prior guidance was a decrease of approximately $820,000. Please refer to our Form 10-K for expanded disclosures on this topic. Gross profits were relatively unchanged at $3.8 million, while the gross margin percentage dropped 1% to 45%.\nAs mentioned during our second quarter earnings call, the U.S. federal government began imposing tariffs on a large number of products imported from China in July 2018. Our core products are manufactured in China and are subject to set tariffs. During the year additional tariffs of approximately $260,000 were imposed representing an adverse impact on gross margins of approximately 3%. This impact was softened by the growth in recurring revenues. Telkonet incurred year-to-date operating expenses of $6.8 million compared to $7.3 million for the same period prior year a decrease of 7%. Non-recurring expenses related to the 2017 sale of the company's wholly-owned subsidiary where the primary components for the year-over-year decrease.\nSales, general and administrative expenses fell to 57% of revenues compared to 67% for the same period prior year. We incurred operating losses from continuing operations of $3 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively. We reported a net loss of $3 million compared to net income of $3.7 million for the fiscal years ended 2018 and 2017 respectively.\nThe gain on the sale of the wholly-owned subsidiary was approximately $6.6 million in 2017. Negative EBITDA is a non-GAAP measurement of $2.9 million and $3 million were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively. We reported approximately $4.7 million in cash and equivalents at December 31, 2018, compared to $8.4 million last year. The outstanding balance on our credit facility was approximately $121,000 and $680,000 and available capacity was approaching $500,000 and $200,000 at December 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively.\nCash used in operating activities of continuing operations during the year was $3.9 million compared to $3.1 million last year. We reported working capital surpluses measured as current assets less current liabilities of $6.2 million and $9.5 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively.\nOur current ratio was 3.8 compared to 4.5 at this time last year. Our average daily sales outstanding improved 18% to 48 days compared to 59 last year. Our cash conversion cycle an indicator of the company's efficiencies and managing working capital assets and liquidity increased to 170 days from 97 at this time last year. A shorter cycle means greater liquidity which translates into less need to borrow, more opportunity to leverage spend via cash discounts in an increased capacity to fund the expansion of the business into new product lines and markets.\nIn closing, thank you for your interest and to our shareholders specifically. Thank you for your continued support. I'll now turn the call back to Telkonet's President and Chief Executive Officer, Jason Tienor.\nJason Tienor\nThank you, Gene.\nWith that, I'd like to hand the call back to the operator to accept any questions you might have. Operator?\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of [Ed Stein] [ph] a private investor. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst\nHi Jason. It sounds like it's been a challenging year but you all were up to the challenge. Question, a few years ago, we had an initiative with Trane where you trained a lot of their people to be able to do the installations without a whole lot of effort from us. And then, if I remember correctly you put the instructions on how to do the installs on the Internet, so people could go to that and again less involvement with our crews. Can you tell me where that stands now? Can we handle a whole bunch of orders because we don't need to use all of our personnel for all of the installations?\nJason Tienor\nWe do, Ed. It's a great question. We actually have the majority of our installations taken care of by third party integration and contract services legitimately as part of our operations group. We have three different teams. We have our support team, our project management team and our project development team. The fourth team would be our installation team. We only have two full time direct staff members as part of that installation team and those gentlemen are used largely for onsite oversight of large projects. So we don't do much for staffing for full time services for installation because we have so many partners that provide their own installation resources like that.\nPerfect example of the results of that -- are that our growth in channel partner sales and deployment has moved from just four years ago, we did less than 20% of our annual sales through partner channels to last year we were just under 70% through those very same partner channels. And in your mentioning of Trane, our three largest partners where the bulk of all of our channel partners sales move through, are Onity, Trane and Johnson Controls.\nUnidentified Analyst\nWhat was the first?\nJason Tienor\nOnity, it's a subsidiary, it's a large hospitality security provider, it's a subsidiary of UTC.\nUnidentified Analyst\nOkay. Thank you.\nJason Tienor\nAbsolutely.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] At this time, there are no further questions over the audio portion of the conference. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.\nJason Tienor\nThank you, Operator. Once again as we shared earlier our Q1 earnings call will be coming up on May 15th and following very closely thereafter May 23rd, we will be having our annual shareholder meeting. Please look for your proxy review all apparent notes on the proxy, contact us, the company with any questions and make sure you and anybody else that you may know as a Telkonet's shareholder returns the proxy for it results.\nWith that everyone, I thank you for your attention and your interest in Telkonet and wish you a great afternoon.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

A toddler left brain-damaged after choking on a piece of apple at daycare has prompted a food policy change at more than 120 preschools across New Zealand. Evolve Education Group updated its policy in 2017, a year after the incident that left 22-month-old Neihana Renata with severe cerebral palsy. Apple and other hard fruits and vegetables are now only served to under-3s if they are peeled and grated, cooked or mashed. This is in line with Ministry of Health guidelines . ChildForum's Dr Sarah Alexander, who published a report into the incident , said Neihana would never have choked if these guidelines had been followed in the first place.\nREAD MORE: She wants the Ministry of Education to include them in licensing requirements for early childhood centres. \"[It] would make such a difference for the safety of children,\" she said. But Ministry of Education spokeswoman Katrina Casey said when it reviewed its guidelines after the incident they were shown to be \"clear and fit for purpose\". \"We reinforced the importance, more generally, of closely supervising children in our guidelines on hazard management,\" she said. Neihana was being supervised by teachers when he choked at afternoon tea. Teachers performed first aid but he was in cardiac arrest for 30 minutes, which starved his brain of oxygen. He spent two months in hospital and now requires round-the-clock care. The incident happened at Little Lights Kindy in Rotorua, which was bought by Evolve in 2015. Evolve owns more than 120 centre-based ECE facilities around New Zealand, operating under brands including Lollipops, Active Explorers and Little Lights. SUPPLIED Neihana Renata needs round-the-clock care after being left with severe cerebral palsy. Evolve CEO Rosanne Graham said investigations had shown their policies met national guidelines and teachers had responded appropriately. The group updated the food policy across all its centres following an internal review into the incident. This incident isn't the first of its kind. In 2008, 14-month-old Korey Downie-Boyte died after choking on a piece of apple at daycare. Kidicorp, now BestStart, changed its policy to ensure apples were grated before being given to children. Korey's mother lobbied the Ministry of Education to change its regulations, but the law did not change. Alexander said if the current guidelines weren't made legal requirements, Korey and Neihana won't be the last children harmed.

(NYSE:TSN)", "text": "By Callum Turcan\nImage shown: Tyson's share price has come roaring back since the doldrums of December 2018.\nTyson Foods ( TSN ) is one of the leading providers of protein products in the world and yields 2.2% as of this writing. During its 2018 fiscal year, which ended in late-September 2018, the company sold products in approximately 125 countries including China, Japan, countries within the European Union, various countries in the Middle East, and elsewhere. In order to counterbalance the volatile nature of the commodities business and move into a space with higher margins, Tyson has been expanding its branded value-add product offerings such as ready-to-eat sandwiches, prepared meals, breakfast sausages, and numerous other items under the Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, Ball Park, Wright, State Fair, Aidells, Gallo Salame, and Golden Island brands.\nIn this article, let's talk about our skepticism regarding Tyson's ability to reward shareholders through dividend increases, given its acquisition program. We'll also assess the company's valuation, with shares trading at the midpoint of our estimate of the company's range of potential fair value estimate outcomes. We're not huge fans of Tyson fundamentally (its economic profit spread is good though), but we might consider the idea in the newsletter portfolios should it step up its deleveraging efforts. We'd also prefer that its share price fall toward the lower end of our estimate of its range of potential fair value outcomes (price matters), of course, but that's not all that we look at. We'd like to see both enterprise valuation support (intrinsic value support) as well as strengthening technical/momentum indicators, at the same time, to really grow excited.\nWe talk a lot about the importance of combining enterprise valuation (not just the traditional quant value factor) and technical momentum indicators in our new book. We believe combining these two considerations into a methodology helps investors avoid value traps. It doesn't look to us that Tyson's share price is down for the count (see image at the top of this article), which gives us some confidence that the company is not one of those dreaded value traps. With shares fairly valued at the moment and the company's share price holding up, it's not one that we're too worried about. That doesn't mean that we're ready to jump into the idea just yet, however. We'd like to see its share price trading below our estimate of its intrinsic value, something we will talk about later in the note.\nEvaluating Tyson's Business Risk Only one company represented more than 10% of Tyson\u2019s consolidated revenue during its FY2018 , and that was Walmart Inc ( WMT ). The giant big-box retailer accounted for 17.3% of Tyson\u2019s sales last fiscal year, representing one of the company\u2019s most important corporate relationships. If anything were to happen to that relationship, Tyson would likely suffer material financial harm. Tyson\u2019s bargaining power has increased tremendously since going on its acquisition spree, as the firm added numerous top tier brand names to its roster. The kinds of products that consumers would really miss if they weren\u2019t readily available.\nAny relationship; corporate, government, or otherwise, that constitutes a large part of a company\u2019s business profile is one that needs to be monitored. It\u2019s unlikely that Tyson and Walmart would want to jeopardize their relationship for the foreseeable future. Tyson has had to recall some of its products in America this calendar year including 69,000 pounds of ready-to-eat chicken strips and 18 tons of \u201cWhite Meat Panko\u201d chicken nuggets. Recall worries are another big risk for food product producers, with only solid operational execution offering some protection from an inherent risk in the industry.\nAcquisition spree Back in 2014 , Tyson agreed to purchase The Hillshire Brands Company in an all-cash deal valued at almost $8.6 billion when including the net debt Tyson would take on. That was followed up by the all-cash deal in 2017 to buy AdvancePierre Foods Holdings Inc. in a transaction worth $4.2 billion (including the assumption of debt). Management didn\u2019t stop there, as Tyson would go on to buy Keystone Foods from Marfrig Global Foods S.A. ( OTCPK:MRRTY ) for $2.2 billion in cash through a deal made last year.\nAll of these purchases were based in part on operational synergies (realizing economies of scale in the food products industry) and gaining a much larger portfolio of branded value-add products. Tyson even announced it was going to spend $340 million buying the Thai and European operations of BRF S.A. ( BRFS ) in February 2019. That included four processing facilities in Thailand, one in the United Kingdom, and one in the Netherlands along with brands like Speedy Pollo and Grabits.\nThese major acquisitions are how Tyson has aggressively moved into the value-add branded products arena over the past five years. In FY2013 , Tyson\u2019s GAAP gross margin came in at 6.9% as its GAAP operating income clocked in at 4.0%. Fast forward to FY2018 , and Tyson\u2019s GAAP gross margin had firmed up to 12.8% while its GAAP operating income jumped to 7.6%. However, it\u2019s worth noting that since FY2016, Tyson\u2019s GAAP gross and operating margins have been broadly flat. The company had made tremendous headway with improving its profitability early on after the Hillshire purchase, but margin expansion appears to have stalled out since then. During Tyson\u2019s latest quarterly conference call with investors management noted that,\nI am confident in our ability to integrate the BRF operations in part due to the pace and level of team working taking place with the Keystone integration. Keystone is already playing an important role in our growth strategy, and we look forward to maximizing the opportunities inherent in the combined business that benefit our customers as we strive to meet their needs and grow together.\nAs part of the integration process for Keystone, a few weeks ago we announced several organizational changes. This refinement of our team will help us make the most of our biggest growth opportunities which are value added foods in the international markets. I am glad to have everyone on board and the team is eager and motivated to deliver results.\u201d\nWe will be monitoring the integration process to see if margin expansion will resume as Tyson continues onward with its acquisition spree. A corporate organization combined with a renewed focus on selling more branded valued-added food to international markets may do the trick.\nAt the end of FY2013 , Tyson was sitting on $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents versus $0.5 billion in short-term debt and $1.9 billion in long-term debt, good for a net debt load of almost $1.3 billion. By the end of FY2018 , Tyson\u2019s cash and cash equivalents had shrunk to $0.3 billion while its short-term and long-term debt load climbed by to $1.9 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, good for a net debt load of $9.6 billion. Clearly, its acquisition spree has come at the expense of its balance sheet in a bid to become a much larger enterprise with differentiated food product offerings.\nTyson has allocated a moderate amount of its free cash flow generation over the years to keep its net debt position contained. That being said, as a serial acquirer, the company continues to take on debt. By the end of Tyson\u2019s first quarter FY2019 , the firm had a net debt position of $11.6 billion ($3.9 billion in short-term debt plus $8.1 billion in long-term debt minus $0.4 billion in cash).\nFree cash flow and dividend coverage analysis Tyson generated $3.0 billion in net operating cash flow in FY2018 , up 14% year over year as its net income surged from $1.8 billion in FY2017 to $3.0 billion in FY2018. Capital expenditures climbed up by 12% on an annual basis in FY2018 to $1.2 billion, leaving $1.8 billion for free cash flow generation. Free cash flow generation was up 15% from FY2017 levels.\nThe company spent $0.4 billion on dividend payments in FY2018, leaving plenty of free cash flow for $0.4 billion in share buybacks with the remainder going towards net debt reduction. Management indicated that Tyson would be paying down debt built up from recent acquisitions as its capital expenditures will remain contained relatively speaking. During the firm\u2019s latest quarterly conference call with investors, management stated that Tyson\u2019s current net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio stood at 2.8x, which is above past target levels that called for a leverage ratio closer to 2.0x.\nWe note that Tyson has consistently generated free cash flow over the past few years, enabling the company to boost its quarterly dividend from $0.05 per share in late 2013 to $0.375 per share as declared in February 2019. However, its large net debt load makes further dividend growth harder to sustain going forward.\nIn order to systematically evaluate the quality of a company\u2019s dividend coverage in a way that can be applied to any company operating in any industry, we like to use free cash flow analysis. Our work to assess dividend health measures its expected free cash flow generation over the next five years, derived through our discounted cash flow analysis which is conducted in a fastidious manner, less its net debt position (vice-versa for net cash), with that total then getting divided by its expected dividend obligations during the observed period.\nAfter our work is all finished in this capacity, Tyson registers a ratio of 0.9x, earning the company a poor assessment with respect to dividend safety, by our marks. Our dividend growth potential assessment is also very poor, not because it hasn\u2019t increased its payout in the past (or that it won't in the near term), but because future increases will have to contend with deleveraging efforts. It's worth reiterating: we're not expecting Tyson to cut its payout due to the less-than-ideal ratio (in fact, we're forecasting modest growth), but it does mean that investors should start to watch the situation more closely. Debt cuts both ways (positive or negative) depending on where the company is in the economic cycle. That said, if Tyson were to halt its buying spree, the company's balance sheet would improve materially, and perhaps its dividend resilience would follow, too.\nEvaluating past and future returns on invested capital\nImage shown: Our calculations of return on invested capital.\nOver time, Tyson's return on invested capital has exceeded its weighted average cost of capital. We also expect a spread between these two metrics over the next five years, which is based on our pro forma financial analysis of the company. As a result, we give Tyson's business quality high marks as the company has shown that it is fully capable of properly integrating new assets into its corporate profile in order to realize better margins and growth opportunities. Scoring well in these categories means on a fundamental level, the company is performing strongly, but note that is different than viewing the company in terms of valuation (which is a function of investor expectations of business quality, not necessarily business quality itself). As it relates to the context of valuation, Tyson is trading near the midpoint of our estimate of its fair value range of outcomes, indicating shares are fairly priced as of this writing (see image below).\nConcluding thoughts All things considered, Tyson is doing the right things as far as its corporate profile is concerned, but its ability to reward shareholders through dividend increases remains limited until the acquisition spree stops or margin expansion continues sometime in the not too distant future. How well Tyson is able to integrate the newest additions to its portfolio will be key. Looking ahead, the company's outlook isn't bad at all :\nFor fiscal 2019, USDA indicates domestic protein production (beef, pork, chicken and turkey) should increase approximately 3% from fiscal 2018 levels, but we expect domestic availability of protein to increase approximately 2% as export markets should absorb a portion of the increase in production.\nSales \u2013 For fiscal 2019, we expect sales to grow to approximately $43 billion due to volume growth and mix, as well as the impact of the Keystone acquisition. Most of the sales growth is expected to occur in our Chicken segment and Other, as well as expected growth in our Prepared Foods segment after excluding the impact of the divestitures\nReaffirming Adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal 2019 of $5.75-$6.10.\nTyson's bottom line guidance was about in line with expectations . As of this writing, Tyson trades at the midpoint of its range of potential fair value estimate outcomes (based on our enterprise valuation process), so a moderate amount of share repurchases should be viewed as acceptable - meaning shares aren't ridiculously expensive where it is blatantly obvious management is too aggressive with buyback deployment.\nWe, as always, would still prefer Tyson consider stepping up its deleveraging efforts to ensure a safe and healthy dividend over the long haul, unless of course, its share price falls toward the lower end of its range of potential values, at which buying back stock may be the best move. The situation is always a dynamic one. Tyson has a strong business, great returns on capital, a solid outlook, but leverage and its so-so valuation keep us less enthused about its stock at current levels.\nImage Shown: Tyson trades just above our range of potential values, which is derived from our rigorous discounted cash flow analysis\nAuthor\u2019s note: Some of the companies mentioned above don\u2019t trade on a major U.S. stock exchange, which come with their own unique sets of risks and rewards.

The company officially canceled the AirPower. The company's wireless charger was not a rumor - AAPL announced the product on stage at its 2017 iPhone event. However, after a year and a half of delays and quietly scrubbing AirPower references from its website, Apple threw in the towel. The company released a statement saying the wireless charge mat has been canceled, apologizing to the customers who have been waiting for it.\nSource: Apple\nGiven that wireless charging is a prominent feature of recent Apple products, including all new iPhones, the Apple Watch and the AirPods, the misstep is not only embarrassing, but it's also leaving money on the table. Despite the bad PR, Apple stock actually saw a slight rise for Friday afternoon's close.\nIt's Official: The Apple AirPower Is Dead On Friday afternoon, Apple sent an e-mailed statement to TechCrunch , finally conceding defeat on the AirPower wireless charger.\n\"After much effort, we've concluded AirPower will not achieve our high standards and we have cancelled the project. We apologize to those customers who were looking forward to this launch. We continue to believe that the future is wireless and are committed to push the wireless experience forward.\"\nThat puts an end to the product that AAPL first announced at its 2017 iPhone event .\nWhat Was the AirPower and Why Was It Important? Apple has been moving its mobile products toward wireless charging capability, but it has been several years behind rivals like Samsung in supporting the technology in the iPhone. And while the Apple Watch charges wirelessly, it does so with proprietary magnetic induction technology - not the Qi standard that smartphones (including the iPhone) use.\n10 Tech Stocks That Transformed Their Business With no wireless charger of its own, Apple was leaving money on the table with every iPhone sold. Customers who wanted to use the convenient feature had to buy a third-party charger.\nWith Apple stock feeling the pressure from slowing iPhone revenue, these add-on sales become even more important. Apple decided to release its own wireless charger, but wanted its version to charge everything - iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods. The company also wanted to set the bar high for ease of use, so products could be set anywhere on the mat (not in designated locations) and they would just start charging.\nImmediately after the announcement, the AirPower was featured on Apple's website, but the delivery date soon changed to read \"coming in 2018\" and then \"currently unavailable.\" After the 2018 iPhone event, the AirPower disappeared from Apple's website altogether, even as AAPL continued to promote the wireless charging capability of its devices. When the second-generation AirPods wireless earbuds were released several weeks ago, the retail box had a picture of the AirPower charging mat .\nAn Embarrassing Debacle for AAPL Like any tech company, Apple has products it works on sometimes right up to the prototype stage and then abandons. That is expected.\nThe difference with the AirPower is that the company actually announced the product (at its biggest event of the year), showed off pictures of it, put it on its website, kept people guessing for a year and a half and then cancelled it.\nMaking the situation far worse is the fact that wireless chargers are mainstream. There are hundreds of them on the market. Samsung offers its own version for the Galaxy smartphones, and Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google sells one for the Pixel.\nThird-party companies are in on the action as well. I recently reviewed a Nomad Base Station that will wirelessly charge an iPhone and AirPods, plus an Apple Watch simultaneously. It works flawlessly, although the Apple Watch charger is physically separate from the charge mat.\nApple apparently ran into a wall by trying to be too ambitious. The company wanted the AirPower to charge multiple devices simultaneously when placed anywhere on its surface while displaying real-time charge levels of each on a iPhone. That approach reportedly resulted in overheating issues that Apple engineers were unable to overcome.\n7 ETFs to Buy for Serious Diversification Unfortunately, the public perception is that Apple took a year and a half to try to make a wireless charger - a commodity product - and failed. And it made a big deal about a new product, then killed it. Add to that the fact that it has been trumpeting the wireless charging capability of its products, but has no wireless charger to go with them. The AirPower episode has eroded the public's perception of Apple's design prowess.\nHowever, of more immediate concern to AAPL investors is that the lack of a wireless charger means every time the company sells an iPhone or set of AirPods, customers who want the convenience will add a third-party wireless charger to their cart. That's anywhere from $50 to $150 in potential revenue that could have gone toward helping Apple stock weather the iPhone sales decline.\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.\nMore From InvestorPlace 2 Toxic Pot Stocks You Should Avoid 10 Tech Stocks That Transformed Their Business 8 Genomic Testing Stocks That Can Ease the Sting of Theranos 7 Weak Blue-Chip Stocks to Trim Immediately Compare Brokers The post Apple Shows Signs of Weakness After Canceling AirPower Wireless Charger appeared first on InvestorPlace .\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-29/apple-cancels-anticipated-airpower-wireless-charging-accessory?srnd=technology-vp", "https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/apple-cancels-airpower-product-citing-inability-to-meet-its-high-standards-for-hardware/", "https://investorplace.com/2019/03/8-genomic-testing-stocks-that-can-ease-the-sting-of-theranos/?cc=referral&cp=nasdaq", "https://investorplace.com/2019/03/10-tech-stocks-that-transformed-their-business/?cc=referral&cp=nasdaq", "https://investorplace.com/?cc=referral&cp=nasdaq", "https://investorplace.com/2017/09/apple-event-iphone-x-lives-up-to-hype/?cc=referral&cp=nasdaq", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradmoon/2018/11/01/review-nomad-base-station-apple-watch-edition/#676d3bf528e4", "https://investorplace.com/2019/04/apple-shows-signs-of-weakness-after-canceling-airpower-wireless-charger/?cc=referral&cp=nasdaq", "https://investorplace.com/options-trading/broker-center/?cc=referral&cp=nasdaq", "https://investorplace.com/2019/03/7-weak-blue-chip-stocks-to-trim-immediately/?cc=referral&cp=nasdaq", "https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/25/airpower-referenced-on-airpods-packaging/", "https://investorplace.com/2019/04/7-etfs-to-buy-for-serious-diversification/?cc=referral&cp=nasdaq", "https://investorplace.com/2018/10/toxic-pot-stocks-to-avoid?cid=MKT382818&eid=MKT385969&cc=referral&cp=nasdaq"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "apple shows signs of weakness after canceling airpower wireless charger shutterstock", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aapl", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T03:36:39.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f8c78cc3fb07b9aa1d94c8bda412422262ea6385", "url": "https://www.nasdaq.com/article/monday-apple-rumors-2019-iphone-may-support-two-way-wireless-charging-cm1123056", "site_full": "www.nasdaq.com", "site": "nasdaq.com", "site_section": "https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/bnj/stock-report", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "- NASDAQ.com", "title": "Monday Apple Rumors: 2019 iPhone May Support Two-Way Wireless Charging", "title_full": "Monday Apple Rumors: 2019 iPhone May Support Two-Way Wireless Charging - Nasdaq.com", "published": "2019-04-01T10:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/images/dreamit.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2975, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f8c78cc3fb07b9aa1d94c8bda412422262ea6385", "url": "https://www.nasdaq.com/article/monday-apple-rumors-2019-iphone-may-support-two-way-wireless-charging-cm1123056", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "InvestorPlace Media", "published": "2019-04-01T10:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Monday Apple Rumors: 2019 iPhone May Support Two-Way Wireless Charging", "text": "Shutterstock photo\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nLeading the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) rumor mill today is news of a possible feature for the 2019 iPhone.

Adam Levy ( TMFnCaffeine ) Apr 1, 2019 at 6:00PM\nApple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) is really taking this services thing to heart. When the company took the wraps off its paid subscription Apple TV+ service, it also unveiled a host of platforms customers will be able to stream the service from. Most notably, TV+ will be available on Roku ( NASDAQ:ROKU ) and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) Fire TV devices.\nThat's not really a big surprise after Apple said at CES earlier this year that it would make iTunes available on Samsung smart TVs. After that announcement, I wrote, \"Apple will charge customers for access to its content and work to make it available on as many popular platforms as possible. That could mean a partnership with Roku and Amazon as well.\"\nWhile Apple has 1.4 billion active devices in use, only a small handful of those are Apple TVs. Roku and Fire TV are, by far, the most popular way to watch streaming video on TV screens, and their lead is growing . Image source: Apple. People stream television on their televisions\nApple controls a significant market share of smartphones and an even bigger share of tablets. It also has a sizable installed base of Mac computers.\nBut Apple's share of TV-connected streaming devices is relatively small. Just 15% of streamers used an Apple TV device, according to a Parks Associates survey from last year. By comparison, Roku and Amazon held 37% and 28% shares, respectively.\nA similar survey from William Blair analysts last summer found 27% and 29% of consumers stream video on a Roku or Fire TV, respectively, compared to just 16% that use Apple TV. It also found 30% of consumers stream video via the built-in operating system on their smart TV.\nBy partnering with Roku and Amazon, as well as a handful of smart TV manufacturers, Apple will more than quintuple its reach on televisions.\nThat's important because the television is still where most people watch television. Netflix says 70% of its subscribers' viewing hours are on connected televisions. If Apple couldn't reach its potential audience where they want to stream video, Apple TV+ would be DOA. Is it worth it?\nApple is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on content for TV+. While its content budget isn't nearly the size of Netflix's $12 billion cash outlay on content in 2018, it still requires a level of scale for the investment to pay off. It might not need Netflix-like scale, but it needs more scale than the built-in Apple TV user base could offer.\nUltimately, however, Apple is sacrificing the opportunity to use TV+ as a selling tool for its hardware -- a strategy that was practically presumed until the recent announcement.\nBut the sacrifice might not be that big. Apple didn't mention any support for Android devices, so if users want to stream on mobile they might need to buy into the iOS ecosystem. And Apple generates much more revenue from iPhone and iPad sales than it does Apple TV. That revenue is very likely more profitable as well.\nIt's impossible to tell whether this strategy will result in a more profitable company. But considering the massive television audience outside of Apple's hardware reach and the relatively small size of Apple TV in the company's business, the risk is certainly worth it.

Please go ahead, sir.\nRiccardo Delle Coste\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today, we will review our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 results. Discuss our 2018 accomplishments, review our growing sales channels and provide additional insights into our expanding sales pipeline.\n2018 was a very strong year for us both from a revenue growth perspective as well as operationally. We announced two major milestone achievements with national account approvals and made significant headway in our new sales channels in schools and military. Before I walk through these accomplishments in more detail, let me first provide a high level overview of our 2018 financial results.\nOur 2018 net sales increased 112% to over $4.2 million, while gross margin expanded 6% to 51%. We also reduced general and administrative expenses by 18% or $1.7 million and we reduced our operating loss by 31% or $2.7 million.\nOur fourth quarter net sales were up 141% to over $900,000 and net cash from operating activities improved by $3.2 million in 2018 from a use of cash of $7.3 million in 2017 to a use of cash of $4.1 million in 2018.\nDue to the improvements we have made in our cost structure and economies of scale through topline growth, we expect the improvement in cash flow to continue and accelerate in 2019. We are very pleased with our results over the past year and expect to see a material ramp in sales during 2019 as momentum in the business continues to grow.\nNow, I'd like to take a few moments to review some of the accomplishments we made over the course of 2018. Throughout the year, our Education and Military Channels continue to grow and we are still only just scratching the surface in both of these channels.\nOn our last Business Update Call, we announced that we had expanded to 300 schools nationally throughout multiple states. This channel is quite large with 98,000 schools in the U.S. Not only were we able to further strengthen our position in the school channel in 2018 by entering into a distribution agreement with the largest specialty food supply of the schools in the U.S., we also expanded with multiple national distributor contracts.\nSince our last call, we have already had a significant increase in school locations to over 350 and we continue to add more as well as adding more schools in districts that were already customers. In fact, we are in the middle of the school bid season and expect another material ramp of school locations to begin for the new school year. We plan to provide an exciting school specific update very soon.\nTurning to our Military Channel. At the end of January, we issued a press release announcing that we had expanded to 100 U.S. Armed Forces Dining Facilities, a 36% increase in two months and we continue to add more locations and make strong gain in this channel.\nThe feedback from the basis has been very positive and the results have confirmed that our product is a perfect fit for the high volume military dining facilities. This is another tremendous channel as there are 940 bases in the United States serving 1.3 million active troops and we are serving multiple locations within some bases.\nLastly, moving on to our national accounts, after a lengthy set of tests and approval process, we receive written notification this past November that our products had been approved for a national rollout to a QSR chain with over 2,500 locations and we are looking forward to a system-wide rollout for this account.\nFinally, during the first quarter of 2019, we successfully raise $4.3 million through the combination of an equity raise and warrant exercise. Joe Tesoriero, our CFO will provide more details on the capital raise during his comments. This capital injection has strengthened our balance sheet as we launch into 2019 putting us into an excellent position to build on our 2018 accomplishments.\nOverall, we are very excited to be entering 2019 from a strong operational and financial position. We see a clear path to profitability and to being cash flow positive and are ready to expand on these opportunities and announce additional major customer wins and rollouts in the coming months.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Joe Tesoriero to discuss the financial results before handing it off to our President, Joe Cugine, who will provide more insights into our channels and opportunities. Joe?\nJoseph Tesoriero\nThank you, Riccardo. Today I'll discuss fourth quarter and full-year 2018 financial results and then provide an update on the key operational aspects of our business. Revenue was $4.2 million for the full-year 2018, an increase of 112% compared to $2 million for 2017. The increase in year-over-year sales is primarily the result of channel expansion in the school and military markets driven by our bulk Easy Pour product.\nOur gross profit margin for the full-year 2018 was 51%, compared to 46% in 2017. The improvement in gross profit margin was driven by a number of factors including the leverage gain from the larger scale of production and product mix. We expect gross profit margins for 2019 to be similar to that of 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expense for 2018 improved by 18% or $1.7 million, reducing from $9.5 million in 2017 to $7.8 million in 2018. The primary driver of this improvement was at 29% reduction in personnel costs from $4.2 million to $3 million, a reduction of $1.2 million. Higher sales, improved gross margin and reduced G&A expense allowed us to reduce our operating loss by 31% or $2.7 million for the full-year 2018.\nTurning to the fourth quarter 2018 results, revenue was $906,000, an increase of 141% compared to $376,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017. The same factors that drove the year-over-year improvement in revenue and gross profit margin drove the improved results in the fourth quarter.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we realized the reduction of $968,000 in our general and administrative expense, an improvement of 42% driven primarily by the reduction in personnel costs.\nTurning to our balance sheet, we ended the year with $1 million of cash. On February 27, 2019, we announced that we had raised approximately $4.3 million of capital through the combination of a private placement of equity and the cash exercise of existing warrants.\nThe two components of the capital raise consisted of an issuance of 4 million shares of common stock at $0.60 per share, with no warrant coverage, and the exercise of 3.1 million existing warrants at an exercise price of $0.60 per share, for total gross proceeds of approximately $4.3 million.\nWe ended the year with $1.2 million of inventory, about 13% lower than the $1.4 million of inventory we had on hand at the beginning of the year. This improvement in working capital is a result of our increased sales during the fourth quarter, coupled with our ongoing focus to control working capital.\nOverall, considering our accelerating revenue trend, strong gross profit margin, improving G&A structure, and strong balance sheet, we are in a strong financial position as we enter 2019 to accelerate our penetration in the School and Military Channels and to begin rollout to the 2,500 plus location National QSR that Riccardo mentioned in his opening comments.\nNow with that, I will turn the call over to our President, Joe Cugine. Joe?\nJoseph Cugine\nThank you, Joe. Riccardo opened the call today by highlighting recent customer wins and how these wins have us positioned for another year of strong revenue in 2019. I'll start by discussing the QSR channel. We announced on our last earnings call in November that we had received written approval for the rollout of our products from a National QSR with over 2,500 locations, our largest customer to-date. This was a major milestone for our Company and dramatically expands the long-term growth opportunities for Barfresh.\nAdditionally, we continue to test and work with a strong pipeline of large national restaurant chains that we expect to move from testing to launch in the near-term. Barfresh has a proven resources in place with an established organization with ample manufacturing capacity, logistics and distribution network to begin executing against this opportunity and others.\nWe continue to aggressively expand number of outlets and number of assets pouring our product as well as introducing existing customers to new flavors and platforms, which are driving increased sales. [Amples] of this expansion include QSRs, casual dining restaurants, third-party operators, dining and large traffic customer segments such as zoos, theaters and ski resorts.\nFor example, seven of our top 10 bulk customers are adding new locations in 2019 driving incremental sales with their consumers. Clearly increasing our customers\u2019 revenue and profits will only strengthen our partnerships.\nIn addition, within our single-serve platform, casual dine customers such as Landry's, which includes outstanding Barfresh customers such as Bubba Gump Shrimp and Joe\u2019s Crab Shack will not only introduce new flavors and concepts of these existing venues, but we'll also look to expand outlets within the Landry's portfolio. Concepts such as adding liquor to the Barfresh smoothie expands the range of consumer opportunity for Barfresh.\nMoving to the Education Channel, starting Q2, 2019, we are now in contract with and/or selling our products into well over 350 school locations with another very significant ramp up about to be announced for the 2019 school year. With over 14,000 U.S. public school districts, representing over 98,000 schools, we continue to expand the number of states, counties and school districts on a weekly basis.\nThe true testament to the untapped need for our product on school menus that we started about 18 months ago with less than 50 school locations and I've grown to more than seven times that number in such a short period of time. We further advanced our progress in the education channel last year with agreements we signed with several new distributors.\nAnd lastly, one of the drivers of growth for us in the school segment is variety. We are adding three new flavors that are now in distribution and selling in schools. Our school consumers are constantly seeking options and our new flavors are hitting the mark. The last channel, I'll highlight is the Military Channel. Yet another crucial channel we have quickly expanded and moving from just six military bases as the start of Q2, 2018 to now providing our products over 100 U.S. Armed Forces Dining Facilities.\nWe continue to actively pursue all U.S. Military Facilities and starting this year, we will begin pursuing international military dining facility locations. Important to note that we are in multiple locations at some bases, for example in 2018, we installed five smoothie machines and five separate locations on one base and six on another.\nIn summary, during 2018, we succeeded in building a strong foundation of diverse revenue streams, which will provide a stable and consistent revenue base for our business. The rapid expansion in the military and education channels as well as the approval for rollout with multiple large national accounts, demonstrates the success of our strategy and the large runway for growth ahead.\nAnd with that, I turn it back to Riccardo.\nRiccardo Delle Coste\nThank you, Joe. As you can see from our fourth quarter and full-year results as well as our commentary, we have more than doubled the prior year sale. We've reduced our losses by 31% last year alone and continue to improve our cost structure while increasing our sales and increasing our margin.\nWe achieved major customer approval milestones with a National QSR that will be transformational when rolled out. We have more major customers that we expect will come out of testing and also moving to rollout.\nWe entered 2019 with well over 350 schools and growing at a rapid rate. We now also have over 100 military base locations and many more being added that will be pouring our products. We now see a clear path to profitability and being cash flow positive.\nWe have tremendous long-term growth opportunities for the foreseeable future and we are optimistic about the year ahead and look forward to updating you on additional wins on the next business update call and throughout 2019. I would like to finish by thanking our employees for their continued hard work and our shareholders for their continued support.\nNow with that, let me open up the call for questions.\nOperator\nAt this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Justin Borus from Ibex Investors. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Borus\nHey, guys. Thanks again for doing the call. My question is really focusing on the national accounts. Can you give us a little bit of additional color, how many you think we are getting to the final phases of testing and getting close to rollout? Is it just the one that announced in November or do you have two more, five more, 10 more, just give us a sense of how many potential customers we might be talking about here?\nRiccardo Delle Coste\nHi, Justin. Look we obviously we've announced one of them that we've received the approval before. As we've always mentioned, we have had multiple major accounts kind of going through these process. I can tell you that it is definitely more than one and it's some way between the two to five range, that are quite significant and quite advanced and quite large.\nJustin Borus\nI know it seems like we've been on the one yard line here for a while. I don't know how specific you can get on timing, but would it surprise you if we started seeing sales from these national accounts even this summer or is this more of a 2020 type of thing?\nRiccardo Delle Coste\nNo, it wouldn't surprise me, but at the same time, we're not talking specifics around timing for rollout. The last thing we want to do is jeopardize our customers. So we\u2019re really steering away from that. But I will tell you that you'll saving the numbers.\nJustin Borus\nGreat. Well, thanks and keep up the progress and really hope you get to profitability. I know I probably speak for a lot of shareholders that the dilution every now and then is certainly something we don't love. But I know you've been turned down the cost and getting the profitability would be a big step in the right direction.\nRiccardo Delle Coste\nI can tell you that\u2019s \u2013 it's absolutely a focus of house, 100%.\nJustin Borus\nGreat. Thanks.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from line of Anthony Vendetti from Maxim Group. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Vendetti\nThanks. Good afternoon.\nJoseph Cugine\nHey, how are you?\nAnthony Vendetti\nHey, how are you? So the G&A, it looks like you mentioned on the call, I guess Joe you mentioned that you trend expenses and personnel, so the $1.35 million in the fourth quarter. Is that now a good run rate to use going forward or is that going to pick up a little bit in 2019?\nJoseph Tesoriero\nI would say that's probably a good run rate as you go forward, Anthony.\nAnthony Vendetti\nOkay. And then I know you can't specifically talk about where you are in the process with some of these other large accounts. But I think you said that there's another two to five. If you had a look at that the \u2013 at your best guess in terms of the timeframe for adding some additional, is there an expectation that at least one of those happens in 2019? Or is this sort of, hey, [they're] there, but it could be a couple of years before they come on board? How would you best characterize it?\nRiccardo Delle Coste\nYes, we definitely not expecting it to be a couple of years, I can tell you that. So look this is something that has been in the works for three, four years now. So we made obviously tremendous progress. We are expecting this year to be another record year, but some distance.\nSo national accounts, a part of that picture and obviously we've done everything that we needed to do to get us here. So we're really steering away from that conversation in terms of announcing the timing. This is a very competitive space. And the last thing, as I mentioned earlier to Justin, the last thing we want to do is jeopardize any of our customers with any product launches.\nAnthony Vendetti\nNo, totally understand.\nRiccardo Delle Coste\nAnd I think the other thing that is maybe getting a little bit loss. We're almost lining them up, right, because whilst we've only announced the approval for one of them, which finishes the process to be able to go to rollout. We really do have multiple others that are close to the end of that process as well. And we're talking household names, big brand names that we're dealing with.\nAnthony Vendetti\nRight. Okay excellent. And then you keep increasing the schools that you're signing up and I know you're right in the middle of the time when that resets and you can sign up some more. Right now at 350 schools that's still a small percentage of your revenue. Correct? And then military, now you were in 100 dining facilities? If you had a add school and military up together, is that roughly 20% of your revenues? How should we look at it?\nRiccardo Delle Coste\nGood question. So on the number of school, even though it's 350, right now, we expect that number, given that we are in the middle of the bid season to increase significantly just with what accounts we've already been in touch within tests that have been completed and progress that we've been making. So come to new school year, there will be another material \u2013 there will be a material ramping in those schools.\nIn addition, we've mentioned some new flavors and new products et cetera. So we continue to be working very closely in this channel. As we grow the business, there is \u2013 the business is really stabilized in a way and it's going to continue to do so. When we first started we had we were really a speculative company that had a great long shot of securing a major national account and that was everything that we where.\nAnd we've really developed over time to a) that long shot is now crystallizing, right and we will be crystallized very shortly for what we initially set out to achieve. But in addition to that, we've now gone and created two other product channels being the education and the military on top of other regional accounts.\nSo when you look at splitting the business up between to say single-serve for national accounts and then bulk product for say some regional high volume locations or military and education. We expect the single-serve with the national accounts to far outstrip the bulk product.\nSo \u2013 and that is true for this year is what we expect. And then on the bulk between military and education, it's going to be a healthy \u2013 it's a healthy percentage now, but it's definitely going to change. We expect it to change very shortly.\nSo that should give you some sense of the product mix for where we are now and really what we expect. I mean, the national accounts is just so big that once you rollout single serve, they're really takes over by some degree.\nAnthony Vendetti\nAnd Riccardo, just you said it's a very competitive market. But in terms of the single serve, a market that you have, you've perfected the packaging, it's all one packet. You don't have to \u2013 it's the exact measured amount. Who else is really doing exactly that? I mean, I know there's a lot of competition in the smoothie market, but who's actually doing exactly what you're doing?\nRiccardo Delle Coste\nIn food service, there really isn't anybody, and we have our patents, right. The \u2013 we have a distribution paces, a pretty locked up, we oversee had an exclusive distribution agreement with Cisco. Cisco is one of the largest distributors in the country for food service.\nSo we haven't really seen anything in the food service space, because it's more than just \u2013 it's more than just the packets, the distribution. It's the efficiency, that\u2019s the ability to create the product that is actually cost effective for the restaurants, right. There's probably other people out there in the retail space, but the cost of making those products is very expensive. So that's kind of the space that we own right now.\nAnthony Vendetti\nAnd lastly on the sourcing, the fruit necessary to meet the demand, as you rollout, the national account to 2,500 locations. And do you have the sourcing that you need, the capacity that you need to produce to meet the needs of not only this national account, but the others that are in the pipeline?\nRiccardo Delle Coste\nAnother good question, I can tell you that you do not get the approval right, until you've already worked through those items with the customer. So it was a necessary part of our process that we needed to work all of that out to understand our supply chain, our lead times, all of that. So the answer is, yes. We have worked that out and we have very stringent supplier approvals and lead times and requirements that go into being able to service these accounts.\nAnthony Vendetti\nOkay, great. Thanks.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of William [indiscernible] from Greenwich Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst\nHey, guys. With all the new customers you're adding or I guess locations you're adding, why did we see the revenue fall in the fourth quarter?\nRiccardo Delle Coste\nYes, good question. So it was a combination of a few things. One is we had a lot of schools have started in Q3. So there was a bit of a loading factor for the schools have started, that took product in Q3, a. b) There was a little bit more of a seasonality that probably we didn't expect for the end of the year between the military bases and the schools with the vacations and holiday times. So that was really what we found to be the case.\nUnidentified Analyst\nOkay. With the two national accounts, you\u2019ve talked about the 1,000 location in the 2,500? Is everything fixed and are all 1,000 locations going on that and when will be fully ramped out on the 2,500?\nRiccardo Delle Coste\nYes, so again just a two part question. So the first one is, we have made a lot of progress with working through some of the operational issues that we had with the first national account. And we are starting to see that turn with more accounts being added and better throughput. So that is being fixed and we'll start to have an impact.\nWith regards to the 2,500 plus national account, again just reiterating what I said before, we're not speaking to the exact timing, but everyone will be able to see it in the numbers when it comes up and keeping the mind, that's just one that we've confirmed the approval for. So there are others.\nUnidentified Analyst\nOkay. So when you announced this, there was no set timeline as to \u2013 we have the customer \u2013 the customer wants to rollout starting at this time. It's really just at their discretion when they wanted to start turning this time.\nRiccardo Delle Coste\nWell, there's a process that they need to go through, but we've been approved and the calendar has been set. So we'll update everybody, when we're able to update.\nUnidentified Analyst\nOkay. And last question on the schools, when you announce, you get new school, do we have to wait until like the new semester or new school year or when you announced that are they coming on right away?\nRiccardo Delle Coste\nFor the most part when we announced them, they've already been signed and they're in the process of actually been set up.\nUnidentified Analyst\nOkay.\nRiccardo Delle Coste\nSo not the new school year, so with the new numbers that we have and we'll be providing another separate update shortly because we have some more developments. But right now when we announced the schools, they've been set up now.\nUnidentified Analyst\nAll right. Thank you.\nOperator\nWe have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call back to management for closing remarks.\nRiccardo Delle Coste\nYes. We just like to thank everybody for attending the call today and we look forward to updating everybody shortly on new developments. Thanks everyone.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.

The service was added to Amazon\u2019s Fire TV in March and Apple has been making it clear since the beginning of the year that it sees the expansion of device support as a critical part of its new, services-first strategy. This began with the announcement that AirPlay 2 would be appearing outside of the Apple hardware ecosystem for the first time, starting smart TVs from Samsung, LG, Sony, and Vizio, plus Roku and Amazon Fire TV devices. Then at the company\u2019s March 25 event, it revealed that most of these same devices would be getting Apple\u2019s newly redesigned TV app , the platform that will be used to give people access to its Apple TV Plus streaming subscription service on both Apple and non-Apple products.\nGiving Apple Music the ability to stream from iOS and Android devices to Chromecast-compatible speakers seems like a small step compared to the much larger expansion of the company\u2019s video services. The move will likely be reciprocated by Google. We reported earlier this year that Apple Music had been spotted as an item with the Google Home app\u2019s list of available services (even though it was inactive). The option has since been removed, but obviously, Google is making its own behind-the-scenes changes that will eventually result in the Google Assistant being able to access Apple Music.\nThis trend of cross-device services compatibility is likely a long-term one. As companies like Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Google, and others put a heavier emphasis on recurring revenues from subscription services, it will be crucial to have the ability to get those services on as many devices as possible. Apple realized this a long time ago when it first opened its iTunes software up to Windows users. According to Steve Jobs\u2019 biographer, Walter Isaacson, Jobs was initially against the idea, but eventually acknowledged it was the only way to get the Apple\u2019s new iPod in the hands of more customers.

Please go ahead.\nKai-Shing Tao\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us today. After the market closed, we issued a press release announcing our results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2018. We are pleased with our fourth quarter topline performance of $22.3 million, which compares to $18.6 million in last year's fourth quarter. Our results exclude an additional $4.6 million from KanKan which was delivered but revenue recognition has been deferred.\nOverall our performance was in line with the preliminary revenues we announced in January. Both of our business segments closed the final quarter of the year on a strong note. As we announced two weeks ago, we have entered into an agreement to sell Vegas.com to VDC-MGG Holdings, an affiliate of our senior lending group. This transaction favorably positions us to significantly reduce our debt, restructure our balance sheet and streamline our cost structure as we transform Remark into a pure AI focus Company.\nWe will now dedicate all of our attention to strategically expanding our AI business globally. To reflect this expansion globally and the breadth of our AI solutions to corporate businesses and governments, KanKan AI will be rebranded to Remark AI. This transformation puts us in a vastly improved position to secure strategic and financial partnership with key players across multiple sectors spanning, retail, manufacturing, agriculture, public safety and security.\nThe Remark AI platform supports highly tailored yet easy to install AI solutions, aimed at solving specific problems, reducing risks and delivering positive outcomes across multiple industry. As we make ongoing progress in deploying our products and scaling our business, we expect to build a stream of recurring revenues supported by modest recurring capital costs and operating leverage. Although the sales cycles in the business-to-business and business-to-government are comparatively longer, the size and long time line of these contracts make it more than worthwhile and thus so highly coveted.\nWe are in the midst of a very strong pipeline of deals that are in testing, proof of concept stage and/or contracts stage in retail, food, manufacturing, construction and agriculture, which we believe will support strong growth in 2019 and beyond, Remark AI in retail. AI is now emerging as a vital component of the next stage of the mass market retail, supermarket and restaurant industry. We view McDonald's widely covered $300 million acquisition last week of the AI startup, Dynamic Yield, as somewhat of a bellwether for the industry.\nMajor mass market brands that touch millions of consumer's everyday recognize the need to improve their ability to utilize data in a way that improves their personal connection to each consumer, creating more sales opportunities, driving conversion and increasing efficiency. McDonald's CEO, Steve Easterbrook said that: \"We hadn't begun to connect the technology together, and get the various pieces talking to each other. How do you transition from mass marketing to mass personalization? To do that, you've really got to unlock the data within that ecosystem in a way that's useful to a customer.\"\nThis is precisely what our solutions are intended to do and the fact what we are already doing in China with Lotus Supermarket. Launched live in stores in Q3, Q4 of 2018, our AI retail solution is off to a solid start as we demonstrate the effectiveness of our technology in elevating engagement, driving transaction and fostering deeper connections with shoppers in large and flagship superstores.\nAt these superstores, as much as 250,000 square feet in size with tens of thousands of skews and thousands of daily visitors, Remark's AI solution has been utilized to significantly enhance the customer experience, increase customer traffic, improve membership conversion and spending per visit, and at the same time reduce the cost of operation by eliminating human errors and driving employee productivity.\nBuilding on our success to-date, we are continuing to work closely with our clients to further integrate our AI products deeper into their operations and expand into more superstores and convenient stores. In addition, our AI solutions are being tested in various retail businesses, including fast food chains, mega shopping malls, autonomous stores and drugstores.\nWhat do we provide for our customers? Our AI solution delivers; one, facial ID-based membership management; two, comprehensive member customer profile; three, precision marketing campaign; and four, smart product selection and e-personalized product recommendation; and finally, face ID payment. We augment data analysis to our data capture abilities across social media, mobile apps and CRM systems among other channels, allowing us to provide store owners with a comprehensive targeting, marketing and analytical platform aimed at engaging consumers and driving higher margin sales.\nBeyond retail, we are also seeing strong momentum in the rollout of our AI safety, security initiative. The public safety and surveillance markets are large opportunity and we're continuing to work with our clients to develop solutions that will be used in construction site, campuses, restaurants and traffic monitoring and enforcement.\nThrough our smart city and smart business solutions offering, we deliver four core products: One, facial ID, ensuring a person's identity which is ideal for airports, trains and custom's checkpoint, financial institutions and facial payment. Two, access control; through facial identification combining with voice identification, it grants access only to the registered, which can be widely applied in places with restricted access control such as hospitals, schools, offices, and community.\nThree, behavioral analysis; this detects persons of interest and suspicious behavior in real time and can be used in police investigation, event security, and POI tracking, safety policy enforcement restaurants, factories, construction sites and hospitals.\nFour, dynamic object recognition; this involves recognizing physical objects in their statuses and static images and video streams in real time. It has been largely used in traffic analysis, i.e. speeding, traffic violation, traffic jam prediction et cetera; environmental protection analysis, i.e. dust, smoke; hazardous condition, for example, toxic gas, liquid leaking, fire and smoke.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to improve and utilize the suite of products to help schools, restaurants, construction sites and city governments to enforce safety and security policy. Through the course of 2019, we're excited to be in the running for a number of large projects not just in Asia but in the U.S. and in Europe.\nSome examples of the deals we are currently in the middle of executing; we're in the midst of expanding our safety security system to large transportation companies that will utilize Remark AI to help verify the identity of the drivers to the passengers [to even wanted criminals].\nOur food safety program has now commenced in Shanghai and we are looking to continue to expand kitchen monitoring system to the city, throughout the city and others. Our agricultural AI system, as it relates to pig farming, looks to commence shortly to target the serious issue of bio-safety especially in the light of the African swine disease. With China being the largest consumer of pork and producers of pig of roughly 700 million a year, this is not only a strategic interest to the pork producing company but to China's overall strategic interests.\nIn the U.S. a shopping center company with over 70 locations, they're looking to lower their $500,000 a year collocation costs; to a fast food restaurant chain with over 2,000 restaurants across the U.S., personalizing their customer experience in the way that McDonald is trying to do with their acquisition of Dynamic Yield; and lastly, a large European store with over 10,000 stores in Europe and U.S., and we're looking to do for them like we have done already for Lotus Supermarket. We are expecting much more deployments points to follow in 2019 and forward.\nLooking to 2019 and beyond, we're focused on building on the success of our retail launch, while continuing to work with our clients across the safety and security market to standardize our products and apply to various applications.\nWe remained very optimistic regarding the future of our AI business, especially as we transition into a pure play provider. Given the scope and diversity of the contracts we secured, the stature and the customers working with in our deployment efforts underway we remain well positioned to build on our revenue growth in the months ahead.\nIn addition, we continue to believe there's a significant untapped value in our key generated assets, principally our minority ownership stake in Sharecare.com. We believe the stake will be ultimately monetized to the benefit of our shareholders.\nAnd now let me turn the call over to Alison for the financial review.\nAlison Davidson\nThank you, Shing, and good afternoon everyone. Turning to our financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018, our revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $22.3 million compared to $18.6 million last year. The increase was driven by $4 million increase in revenues resulting from transaction growth in the Travel and Entertainment segment.\nOur Technology and Data Intelligence segment contributed $2.4 million revenues from the deployment of our AI based retail and safety solution, a further $4.6 million was delivered for our AI-based safety and risk management solutions but the revenue recognition will be deferred until such time as we collect the amounts due from the customer. We anticipate collections to begin in the second quarter of 2019.\nTurning to our expenses, our total cost and expense for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $32.4 million compared to $40 million last year, driven in part by a reduction in impairment charges to $2.2 million $14.6 million in 2017, which included recognize losses at $5.8 million and $8.8 million, an impairment of long-lived intangible assets and goodwill respectively, which were acquired through the CBG acquisition.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we also recorded a 600,000 impairment of the remaining long-lived intangible asset expired in the CBG acquisitions and a $1.6 million impairment of goodwill for the sale of substantially all the remaining assets at Banks.com.\nOur cost and expense for the fourth quarter of 2018 also included a $4.7 million increase in cost of revenue in the Technology and Data Intelligence segment to deliver on fourth quarter projects, and a $1.5 million increase in paid-search costs in the Travel & Entertainment segment resulting from the competitive nature of the paid-search marketplace. Offsetting these increases, it was a $2 million decrease in employee stock compensation.\nOur operating loss was $10.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to an operating loss of $21.4 million in the fourth quarter of last year, due to a reduction in total cost and expense.\nOur net loss for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $7.1 million, or negative $0.19 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $89.2 million or negative $3.47 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of last year.\nThe net loss for the fourth quarter of 2018 included a non-cash gain of $5.7 million related to a change in the fair value of our warrant, which occurred due to the decrease in our stock price during the period. The same period of 2017 included a non-cash loss of $66.5 million related to a change in the fair value of our warrant liability which resulted from an increase in our stock price during that period.\nAdditionally, we reclassified certain amounts in our December 31, 2017 consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss to conform to the current presentation as of December 31, 2018. Specifically, we have changed how we present operating expense to better reflect the activities that generate such expense.\nFor comparability, we have provided a comparison of 2018 results to 2017 results by quarter at our website www.remarkholdings.com. Stockholder's deficit as of December 31, 2017 nor net loss or cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2017 changed because of the reclassification.\nNow turning to our balance sheet, our cash balance is $14.4 million with an additional $11.1 million of restricted cash bringing our combined cash position to $25.5 million at quarter end. This compares to a combined cash position of $34.3 million at December 31, 2017.\nCash decreased primarily due to an increase in total expense as we grow our operations in China and engaged in multiple proof-of-concept projects. The timing of payments related to elements of working capital and paying security deposits related to our Travel and Entertainment business.\nOn March, 2019, we announced our agreement to sell Vegas.com to VDC-MGG Holdings LLC, an affiliate of our senior lending group, for an anticipated enterprise value of approximately $45 million. The cash proceeds of the transaction will be used to pay amounts due to our senior lenders, leaving only approximately $10 million of remaining debt owed to the senior lenders.\nThe transaction remains subject to certain closing conditions including approval of the transaction by our stockholders, we will hold a special meeting of stockholders to obtain t stockholder approval for the transaction. The closing of the transaction is expected to take place during the second quarter of 2019.\nAs part of an agreement to sell Vegas.com, our lenders have agreed to forbear from taking enforcement actions against us to up to June 4, 2019. Also in connection with our agreement to sell Vegas.com, we are in discussions with our lenders regarding our amendment with the financing agreement anticipated to be entered into at the closing of the Vegas.com sale transaction.\nI'll now turn the call over the operator for the Q&A session. Operator, please go ahead.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Darren Aftahi from ROTH Capital Partners. Please go ahead.\nDarren Aftahi\nFirst, just a clarity on the Data Intelligence, I understand you referred $4.6 million of revenue collected in the second quarter, can you help us understand on that $4.7 million on the cost of revenue for KanKan. What is actually in that number? Are there all the costs that are borne with that additional $4.6 million in revenue and then are there additional like TOC costs where there's not revenue related to that yet?\nAlison Davidson\nSo everything that is included in the cost of revenue is related directly to a project -- related directly to a contract. And what's included in cost of revenue does include the costs related to the $4.6 million of revenue that's been deferred into the second quarter.\nDarren Aftahi\nShing, I think when you were at our conference, you had talked about strength across agriculture smart city and in retail I guess, what Q1 basically done and as we look at kind of the first half of the year you know, where are you most excited kind of if you do duplicated I guess, one, in terms of the pipeline of vertical and then two, where you actually think they'll still real revenue materialize over the first 90 to 180 days of 2019?\nKai-Shing Tao\nDarren just to clarify, when you say real revenue what do you mean by that?\nDarren Aftahi\nI mean, this is the first part of where are you most excited about pipeline and then the second would be where you actually will be recognizing revenue from those contracts, so it's more of a sort of the near term and intermediate term kind of view?\nKai-Shing Tao\nYeah, so I think are pretty much all across the board and clearly the AI for the solution that we provided AI for retail and smart city right now seem to have the most of our momentum and certainly followed by that is the agricultural side as I mentioned on the call with the African swine disease, it's a major -- it's a major crisis level right now that's happening in China.\nSo we have begun or and/or are about to begin all across all these different projects, I would say typically after we finish a particular contract, we look to collect the revenue shortly after. Collect the cash shortly after.\nDarren Aftahi\nGot it. And then the three kind of contract you called out, there's the U.S. shopping mall, there's a fast food company with a couple of thousand locations, particularly in the U.S. region sort of a large European/ U.S. retailer. Are those clients that are prospects or are they paid pilots, do you have signed contracts with them just putting more color. It will be helpful.\nKai-Shing Tao\nYeah. We have passed the \u2013 actually for the most part we are either in the final stages of testing or pass the testing part and we're in the contract state right now.\nDarren Aftahi\nAnd then on the Sharecare, can you just indulge us a little more I think at our conference you said you know, more to come. So maybe as it pertains to just capital on the balance sheet, so one, the proxy has been commentary about additional parties interested in Vegas.com and any kind of update there? And then two, as it pertaining to Sharecare, how do we think about kind of monetized go back for the next six to 12 months? Thanks.\nKai-Shing Tao\nYeah, so as it relates to VDC, can't comment on the additional bidders. I think with the transaction value that's been given out there, there's been a number of different groups data, the process that thought that perhaps in their own ecosystems you know, the value could be higher. So we'll see more to be soon as there something that's actually a formal and finalized then that's when we'll give an update on that side.\nAs it relates to Sharecare, I think you know that is something that we've been talking about for a several years. The business right now is doing very well, and it's always in strategic conversations, not really with the financial investors but really more with the strategic partners on how they could get their kind of how fingerprints to be moving the fast way across the U.S. So they've been in discussion, we're always in discussions and you know I'd see something that's going to happen something in the very near future.\nDarren Aftahi\nAnd then just last one. Did you guys use fire raising money in the fourth quarter?\nAlison Davidson\nIn the fourth quarter? No.\nKai-Shing Tao\nNo. We did not.\nOperator\nAnd we will pause a moment. And at this time I'd like to turn our conference back to management for any additional or closing remarks.\nKai-Shing Tao\nNo. We look forward to keeping touch with you on our next quarter's call. Any questions, please reach out to Alison and myself or going to our website at www.remarkholdings.com. Thanks.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's discussion.

Williams led the development of each Apple processor core from the A7 to the A12X Bionic. Williams' primary job was the development of Apple's custom CPU cores, but he also oversaw the layout of its SoCs (system on chips) -- which bundle together the CPU and GPU -- after its SoC architect Manu Gulati left two years ago. A woman uses an iPhone in the rain. More Image source: Apple. Williams is the inventor of over 60 Apple patents related to power management, memory compression, and multicore processor technologies. He previously worked at ARM Holdings, which licenses its chip designs to Apple, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) , and other mobile chipmakers. It's unclear why Williams left, but his exit comes at a pivotal time for Apple, which is trying to reduce its dependence on third-party chips and produce more first-party components. Understanding Apple's chip strategy Most smartphones in the world run on Qualcomm's Snapdragon SoCs. But Apple produces custom ARM SoCs for its iPads and iPhones for four reasons: to differentiate its products, to maintain tighter control over its products' hardware and software, to simplify its supply chain, and to cut production costs. The launch of the A7 in 2013 was a breakthrough for Apple, since it was the world's first 64-bit mobile ARM SoC. Qualcomm followed suit with its own 64-bit SoC, the Snapdragon 410, but the chipset performed poorly and reinforced Apple's chipmaking lead. The A-series SoCs continued to evolve under Williams' watch, with faster CPUs and GPUs as well as more power-efficient designs. However, Qualcomm eventually got its act together, and recent benchmarks indicate that its high-end Snapdragon 855 SoC nearly matches Apple's A12X Bionic in single-core and multi-core performance. Williams' departure could make it tougher for Apple to maintain that slim lead. Qualcomm isn't directly competing against Apple in the SoC market, but the Snapdragon 855 makes high-end Android devices like Samsung 's Galaxy S10 appealing alternatives to Apple's iPhone, which is struggling with longer upgrade cycles and tougher competition. An iPhone production facility. Image source: Apple. Cutting suppliers out of the loop The A-series chips represent the opening chapter of Apple's plans for first-party components. Apple also cut other suppliers out of the loop by producing its own Bluetooth chip for its AirPods and security chips for storing biometric data. It's also developing its own GPUs, modems, and power management chips. All these efforts should boost its long-term gross margins. The development of its own modems is a top priority for Apple, since it's currently engaged in legal battles with its previous supplier, Qualcomm, over its licensing practices. It's currently using modems from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) , which are slower than Qualcomm's and aren't quite ready for 5G networks . Apple could also replace Intel's x86 CPUs with custom ARM SoCs in its Macs in the near future. That could be a tough task, since many Mac applications are optimized for x86 CPUs, and similar efforts to convert Windows PCs from x86 to ARM CPUs caused a myriad of performance and compatibility issues. Williams, who guided the A-series SoC evolution into a chipset which delivers PC-like performance on the iPad Pro, could have helped (or even led) that effort. Should investors be concerned? Engineers leave big tech companies all the time. But Williams' departure raises concerns about Apple's ability to keep producing powerful SoCs for its mobile devices while developing new custom ARM chips for its Macs. Investors shouldn't sell their shares of Apple based on this news, since Williams' successor will also likely be a seasoned industry veteran. But they should still keep an eye on Apple's new SoCs and see if they fall behind Qualcomm's comparable chips, and whether or not the company still plans to produce more of its own components to boost its margins.

Before taxes and other expenses, the firm said it made $212 billion, a figure similar to the combined military budgets of the 28 member states of the European Union.\nThe financial information on Monday was disclosed in a prospectus for a planned bond sale of at least $10 billion to help fund the acquisition of a $69.1 billion stake in Saudi Arabia\u2019s national petrochemicals firm. The 470-page document provided the first look under the hood of Aramco\u2019s finances since the once-American-run firm was nationalized over three decades ago and its profits became state secrets.\nBy disclosing Aramco\u2019s profits and other detailed financial information, some Saudi officials hope they will quell any doubts about their determination to list Aramco publicly by 2021, in what would likely be the biggest ever IPO. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom\u2019s day-to-day ruler, wants to use the IPO to raise tens of billions of dollars to build new futuristic new cities, diversify the kingdom\u2019s oil-dependent economy and fund a host of non-oil industries like technology, entertainment and mining.\nThe 33-year-old prince first broached the IPO in early 2016, but concerns over disclosing Aramco\u2019s finances helped delay it for years, to the point that many bankers and Saudi officials working on the plan believed it would never happen.\nThe financial information on Monday was disclosed in a prospectus for a planned bond sale of at least $10 billion to help fund the acquisition of a $69.1 billion stake in Saudi Arabia\u2019s national petrochemicals firm.

It is an important issue and this is probably a steppingstone to an IPO,\u201d said Theodore Holland, a senior portfolio manager at Zurich-based Fisch Asset Management AG who aims to participate in the debt raising. He said there would be strong demand among investors for Aramco debt.\nThe financial figures\u2014audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Public Accountants\u2014painted a picture of a company with unmatched financial heft.\nThe oil firm\u2019s 2018 net income shot up from 284 billion Saudi riyals, or the equivalent of $75.9 billion, in 2017. By comparison, Apple\u2019s equivalent most-recent full-year profit was roughly $60 billion; Amazon.com Inc. was $10 billion and Exxon Mobil Corp. was $21 billion.\nAramco\u2019s massive earnings numbers come despite taxes of roughly 50% to the government, which is highly reliant on contributions from the oil firm. Aramco also pays a royalty to the Saudi government of 20% of revenues up to $70 a barrel of oil, and the rate increases on a sliding scale at prices above that level. Fitch Ratings estimates that from 2015 to 2017, Aramco accounted for around 70% of Saudi Arabia's revenues.\nBut the three years of financial information contained in the prospectus illustrate how tightly Aramco\u2019s profits are tied to oil prices.\nAramco reported a significantly lower net profit in 2016 of $13.2 billion, the prospectus said, when oil prices fell to an average monthly low of $31.90 a barrel in January that year. Its 2018 profits grew almost ninefold in a year when oil prices rose to over $80 a barrel.\nOpening up Aramco\u2019s books doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the company will go ahead with an IPO.\nPrince Mohammed previously announced he would list 5% of Aramco in 2018 at a valuation of roughly $2 trillion, though that process was delayed due to concerns that the company\u2019s worth wasn\u2019t close to the royal\u2019s estimate.\nThe figures released Monday indicate a lower potential valuation for Aramco, up to about $1.5 trillion, assuming oil prices around $70 a barrel, according to Bernstein Research and Saudi officials familiar with internal calculations. Brent crude was above $68 a barrel on Monday.\nNevertheless, the disclosures to obtain a large foreign bond marked a coming-out party for Aramco.\nAramco has chosen banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley to manage its first debt offering and hold a roadshow beginning Monday in at least eight cities in the U.S., Europe and Asia. Investment bank Lazard is also an independent adviser on the bond sale.\nThe proceeds would be used for as a down payment on its $69.1 billion purchase of 70% of Saudi Basic Industries Corp., or Sabic with the remainder of the acquisition paid in installments over time, The Wall Street Journal has reported.\nAramco said Monday in the bond prospectus that it would pay 50% of the acquisition price at the closing of the deal sometime next year and the rest in installments up to 2021.\nAramco is buying the Sabic stake from Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign-wealth fund, Public Investment Fund, which is expected to use the proceeds to drive Prince Mohammed\u2019s agenda. The fund has already invested or committed nearly $100 billion to partnerships such as SoftBank Group Corp.\u2019s Vision Fund and stakes in technology firms such as Uber Technologies Inc.\nAhead of the Aramco bond sale, agencies published ratings on the oil firm for the first time. Fitch rated Aramco at A+, the fifth-highest investment grade level and the same as Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign bonds. The firm also said it assessed the company\u2019s stand-alone credit profile, ignoring sovereign-related risks, at AA+, or three notches above the level at which the Saudi government itself can raise debt.\nMoody\u2019s likewise rated Aramco A1, a similar level to that given by Fitch, and noted that the oil firm\u2019s ties to the government meant it couldn\u2019t be assessed higher.\nBy comparison, Exxon is rated AAA by Moody\u2019s, its highest level. Moody\u2019s said Saudi Aramco\u2019s bond rating was lower than Exxon\u2019s and others because it \u201cis constrained by the rating of the government of Saudi Arabia given the broad credit linkages between the two.\u201d\nSaudi Aramco is the world\u2019s largest oil producer by volume, Fitch said. The oil firm\u2019s 2018 total hydrocarbon production averaged 13.6 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, including natural gas output, ahead of global and regional producers such as Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Total SA and BP PLC, the ratings agency said.\nSaudi Aramco estimates its proved liquids reserves at 227 billion barrels and its total hydrocarbon reserves at 257 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Aramco\u2019s net cash position at the end of last year was $48.8 billion and total borrowings were $27 billion, according to the bond prospectus. It made 69% of revenues last year from upstream oil and gas and the remainder from so-called downstream operations. - WSJ\nTo gain full access to The Wall Street Journal online, subscribe to StarBiz Premium Plus.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "exxon mobil corp.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aramco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi aramco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T04:36:44.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1145a63324fdfea66377c957a2480ad8a0af873b", "url": "https://www.theage.com.au/national/apple-martin-was-right-to-push-back-against-gwyneth-paltrow-s-post-20190402-p519xq.html", "site_full": "www.theage.com.au", "site": "theage.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.theage.com.au/opinion", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Opinion | Comment &amp; Analysis | The Age", "title": "Apple Martin was right to push back against Gwyneth Paltrow's post", "title_full": "Apple Martin was right to push back against Gwyneth Paltrow's post", "published": "2019-04-01T17:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.162, "main_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.8061,$multiply_1,$ratio_1.777778,$width_1059,$x_0,$y_0/t_crop_custom/w_800/q_86,f_auto/877775e315844ad449978a84299d4a1efd6ad318", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3913, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4, "comments": 3, "shares": 6}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1145a63324fdfea66377c957a2480ad8a0af873b", "url": "https://www.theage.com.au/national/apple-martin-was-right-to-push-back-against-gwyneth-paltrow-s-post-20190402-p519xq.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Joanne Orlando", "published": "2019-04-01T17:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Apple Martin was right to push back against Gwyneth Paltrow's post", "text": "When Gwyneth Paltrow shared a particular mum-daughter pic on social media, it sparked an international debate on whether parents have the right to post photos of their kids. \"Sharenting\" is the term to describe a parent sharing photos of their kids online.

Equally as many said that Apple had every right to disapprove the image. Images stay online forever, so it\u2019s important that you\u2019re happy with them. Loading\nWhile this mother-daughter spat may sit firmly in the world of celebrities where Gwyneth\u2019s whopping 5.3 million Instagram followers will view the photo, it tells a bigger story of where teenagers are up to in terms of protecting their digital identity.\nShould we as parents be expecting this kind of pushback from teens, and should we be OK with it?\nMy answer to both questions is yes. If teens are acting this way, it\u2019s a good thing. It means that they are actually listening to our safety advice about protecting their digital identity.\nIt also shows they have further developed the idea of safeguarding oneself online. For them it also includes ensuring that when others depict them online, it aligns with the digital identity they are comfortable with. Dad uploading the family pic that dad looks best in, or that he thinks the child looks \"cute\" in, doesn\u2019t necessarily fit that brief.\nKids have their lives displayed on social media from day one. Sharing photos of your kids is a great joy for parents but social media is not the modern-day family photo album. Sharing pics online is different to sharing them within the protective environment of your lounge room. Today\u2019s digitally savvy youth don\u2019t want their parents to get this wrong for them because they can\u2019t undo your errors.\nWe often warn kids that future employers can look up their Instagram/Facebook account to find out more about them. These same employers can also follow tags to parent\u2019s accounts.

Reports Full Year Results for 2018", "text": "DALLAS- Transcontinental Realty Investors, Inc. (NYSE: TCI), a Dallas-based real estate investment company is reporting its Results of Operations for 2018. In November 2018, the Company created a new subsidiary Victory Abode Apartments, LLC (\u201cVAA\u201d) and contributed 52 multi-family projects that it owned and operated to VAA. TCI subsequently sold a 50% interest to a third party and recorded a $154 million gain.\nThe Company believes that both the completion of the joint venture creating Victory Abode Apartments and the issuance of the Series B Bonds in the Israeli Bond Market has positioned the company along the strategic lines that it previously indicated. The Company has created a dynamic platform to continue its expansion in the multifamily sector. The ongoing plan is to continue to develop and acquire apartments in the geographic markets where demand exceeds supply.\nBeginning November 19, 2018, TCI began reflecting its ownership of VAA on the Balance Sheet as an investment and its share of the Revenues, Operating Expenses, Depreciation, Amortization and Interest as \u201cEarning from VAA\u201d. The comparative financial statements and the information below reflect approximately 46 weeks of operations for the properties contributed to VAA in 2018 in their traditional categories as compared to a full 52 weeks for 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we reported net income applicable to common shares of $180.1 million or $20.71 per share compared to a net loss applicable to common shares of $16.7 million or ($1.92) per share for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nRevenues\nRental and other property revenues were $121.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This represents a decrease of $4.2 million, as compared to the prior year revenues of $125.2 million. The decrease is primarily due to the contribution of fifty-two properties to the joint venture VAA on November 19, 2018.\nExpenses\nProperty operating expenses were $59.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This represents a decrease of $3.7 million, compared to the prior year operating expenses of $63.1 million. The decrease is primarily due to the contribution of fifty-two properties to the joint venture VAA on November 19, 2018.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses were $22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This represents a decrease of $2.8 million compared to prior year depreciation of $25.6 million. The decrease is primarily due to the contribution of fifty-two properties to the joint venture VAA on November 19, 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This represents an increase of $5.1 million compared to the prior year expenses of $6.3 million. The increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to an increase in fees paid associated with finalizing the formation of VAA as well as and general and professional fees.\nOther income (expense)\nInterest income was $15.8 million for the year ending December 31, 2018 compared to $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 for an increase of $1.9 million. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $2.7 million in interest on receivable owed from our Advisors, offset by a decrease of $0.8 in interest on notes receivable from other related parties.\nMortgage and loan interest expense was $58.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This represents a decrease of $1.0 million compared to the prior year expense of $59.9 million. The decrease is primarily due to the contribution of fifty-two properties to the joint venture VAA on November 19, 2018.\nNo gain on sales of income producing properties was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018. Gain on sale of income-producing properties was $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, attributable to the recognition of deferred gain.\nGain on land sales was $17.4 million and $4.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase of approximately $12.5 million was primarily due to sales of land at Mercer Crossing recognized in 2018.\nOther income was $28.2 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase of $27.6 million was primarily due to a $17.6 million gain recognized in September 2018 for deferred income associated with the sale of assets, as well as income of approximately $7.6 million from insurance proceeds on Mahogany Run Golf Course.\nGain from the sale of 50% ownership in VAA was $154.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. There was no such gain in prior years.\nAbout Transcontinental Realty Investors, Inc.\nTranscontinental Realty Investors, Inc., a Dallas-based real estate investment company, holds a diverse portfolio of equity real estate located across the U.S., including apartments, office buildings, shopping centers, and developed and undeveloped land.

Williams led the development of each Apple processor core from the A7 to the A12X Bionic.\nWilliams' primary job was the development of Apple's custom CPU cores, but he also oversaw the layout of its SoCs (system on chips) -- which bundle together the CPU and GPU -- after its SoC architect Manu Gulati left two years ago.\nImage source: Apple.\nWilliams is the inventor of over 60 Apple patents related to power management, memory compression, and multicore processor technologies. He previously worked at ARM Holdings, which licenses its chip designs to Apple, Qualcomm ( NASDAQ:QCOM ) , and other mobile chipmakers. It's unclear why Williams left, but his exit comes at a pivotal time for Apple, which is trying to reduce its dependence on third-party chips and produce more first-party components.\nUnderstanding Apple's chip strategy Most smartphones in the world run on Qualcomm's Snapdragon SoCs. But Apple produces custom ARM SoCs for its iPads and iPhones for four reasons: to differentiate its products, to maintain tighter control over its products' hardware and software, to simplify its supply chain, and to cut production costs.\nThe launch of the A7 in 2013 was a breakthrough for Apple, since it was the world's first 64-bit mobile ARM SoC. Qualcomm followed suit with its own 64-bit SoC, the Snapdragon 410, but the chipset performed poorly and reinforced Apple's chipmaking lead.\nThe A-series SoCs continued to evolve under Williams' watch, with faster CPUs and GPUs as well as more power-efficient designs. However, Qualcomm eventually got its act together, and recent benchmarks indicate that its high-end Snapdragon 855 SoC nearly matches Apple's A12X Bionic in single-core and multi-core performance. Williams' departure could make it tougher for Apple to maintain that slim lead.\nQualcomm isn't directly competing against Apple in the SoC market, but the Snapdragon 855 makes high-end Android devices like Samsung 's Galaxy S10 appealing alternatives to Apple's iPhone, which is struggling with longer upgrade cycles and tougher competition.\nImage source: Apple.\nCutting suppliers out of the loop The A-series chips represent the opening chapter of Apple's plans for first-party components. Apple also cut other suppliers out of the loop by producing its own Bluetooth chip for its AirPods and security chips for storing biometric data. It's also developing its own GPUs, modems, and power management chips. All these efforts should boost its long-term gross margins.\nThe development of its own modems is a top priority for Apple, since it's currently engaged in legal battles with its previous supplier, Qualcomm, over its licensing practices. It's currently using modems from Intel ( NASDAQ:INTC ) , which are slower than Qualcomm's and aren't quite ready for 5G networks .\nApple could also replace Intel's x86 CPUs with custom ARM SoCs in its Macs in the near future. That could be a tough task, since many Mac applications are optimized for x86 CPUs, and similar efforts to convert Windows PCs from x86 to ARM CPUs caused a myriad of performance and compatibility issues. Williams, who guided the A-series SoC evolution into a chipset which delivers PC-like performance on the iPad Pro, could have helped (or even led) that effort.\nShould investors be concerned? Engineers leave big tech companies all the time. But Williams' departure raises concerns about Apple's ability to keep producing powerful SoCs for its mobile devices while developing new custom ARM chips for its Macs.\nInvestors shouldn't sell their shares of Apple based on this news, since Williams' successor will also likely be a seasoned industry veteran. But they should still keep an eye on Apple's new SoCs and see if they fall behind Qualcomm's comparable chips, and whether or not the company still plans to produce more of its own components to boost its margins.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gerard williams iii", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manu gulati", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "arm holdings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qualcomm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gpu", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T05:00:39.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dfd292da865125932100cf326c42441427f2b325", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/2019/04/01/stock-market-today-apple-kills-airpower-cuts-price.aspx", "site_full": "www.fool.com", "site": "fool.com", "site_section": "http://www.fool.com/investing-news/", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "Motley Fool News &amp; Analysis -- The Motley Fool ", "title": "Stock Market Today: Apple Kills AirPower, Cuts Prices in China", "title_full": "Stock Market Today: Apple Kills AirPower, Cuts Prices in China -- The Motley Fool", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.027, "main_image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/517870/gettyimages-927267276.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1336, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dfd292da865125932100cf326c42441427f2b325", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/2019/04/01/stock-market-today-apple-kills-airpower-cuts-price.aspx", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jim Crumly", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Stock Market Today: Apple Kills AirPower, Cuts Prices in China", "text": "Stocks got off to a strong start in the second quarter, moving higher on news that manufacturing activity in China rose in March.

Shares crept up 0.7%.\nThe cancellation of AirPower amounts to an embarrassment for Apple, but probably won't have much of an impact on financial results. The company announced AirPower in September 2017 as part of the iPhone X unveiling and said it would be available in 2018. Apparently the product development hit some technical snags, so iPhone users will continue to rely on third-party devices for wireless charging.\nMore important to the company's future results was a price cut to iPhone products in China, as reported by CNBC . The price of the entry-level iPhone X model, the XR, was lowered 4.6%, and the price tags on the XS and XS Max were cut 5.7% and 5.2%, respectively.\nA shortfall in China sales took Apple by surprise and caused a rare downward revision in guidance in January. This week's price action may help revive the iPhone business there, and a cut in China's value-added tax from 16% to 13%, which went into effect today, should ease the profit impact on Apple.\nKellogg cuts back on sweets Kellogg is getting out of the cookie business, announcing today that it is selling those brands, along with fruit-flavored snacks, pie crust, and ice cream cone product lines to Italian confection company Ferrero Group for $1.3 billion. Kellogg shares fell 2.4%.\nThe divestiture includes cookie brands such as Keebler, Mother's, Famous Amos, and cookies the company makes for Girl Scouts. Ferrero Group makes chocolates, Nutella, and Tic Tac breath mints.\nKellogg had already announced it was looking for a buyer for those businesses as it tries to reshape its portfolio by investing in new brands in areas such as digestive health and natural foods and reviving existing brands. The affected products accounted for net sales of almost $900 million in 2018 out of total sales of $13.5 billion. The U.S. snack segment of the company suffered a sales decline of nearly 5% last year, and Kellogg thinks divesting parts of that business will help it deliver organic growth of 1% to 2% in 2019, up from a flat performance last year.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/01/apple-slashes-iphone-prices-in-china-by-as-much-as-5percent.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "getty images", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kellogg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "index percentage change point change dow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gspc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T05:01:00.033+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "924708712d62aade9ccc31499248e4b2b5ca84f0", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/2019/04/01/apple-is-willing-to-sacrifice-apple-tv-for-apple-t.aspx", "site_full": "www.fool.com", "site": "fool.com", "site_section": "http://www.fool.com/investing-news/", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "Motley Fool News &amp; Analysis -- The Motley Fool ", "title": "Apple Is Willing to Sacrifice Apple TV for Apple TV+", "title_full": "Apple Is Willing to Sacrifice Apple TV for Apple TV+ -- The Motley Fool", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/517741/apple-introduces-apple-tv-plus-03252019.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1336, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "924708712d62aade9ccc31499248e4b2b5ca84f0", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/2019/04/01/apple-is-willing-to-sacrifice-apple-tv-for-apple-t.aspx", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Adam Levy", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Apple Is Willing to Sacrifice Apple TV for Apple TV+", "text": "Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) is really taking this services thing to heart. When the company took the wraps off its paid subscription Apple TV+ service, it also unveiled a host of platforms customers will be able to stream the service from. Most notably, TV+ will be available on Roku ( NASDAQ:ROKU ) and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) Fire TV devices.\nThat's not really a big surprise after Apple said at CES earlier this year that it would make iTunes available on Samsung smart TVs. After that announcement, I wrote, \"Apple will charge customers for access to its content and work to make it available on as many popular platforms as possible. That could mean a partnership with Roku and Amazon as well.\"\nWhile Apple has 1.4 billion active devices in use, only a small handful of those are Apple TVs. Roku and Fire TV are, by far, the most popular way to watch streaming video on TV screens, and their lead is growing .\nImage source: Apple.\nPeople stream television on their televisions Apple controls a significant market share of smartphones and an even bigger share of tablets. It also has a sizable installed base of Mac computers.\nBut Apple's share of TV-connected streaming devices is relatively small. Just 15% of streamers used an Apple TV device, according to a Parks Associates survey from last year. By comparison, Roku and Amazon held 37% and 28% shares, respectively.\nA similar survey from William Blair analysts last summer found 27% and 29% of consumers stream video on a Roku or Fire TV, respectively, compared to just 16% that use Apple TV. It also found 30% of consumers stream video via the built-in operating system on their smart TV.\nBy partnering with Roku and Amazon, as well as a handful of smart TV manufacturers, Apple will more than quintuple its reach on televisions.\nThat's important because the television is still where most people watch television. Netflix says 70% of its subscribers' viewing hours are on connected televisions. If Apple couldn't reach its potential audience where they want to stream video, Apple TV+ would be DOA.\nIs it worth it? Apple is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on content for TV+. While its content budget isn't nearly the size of Netflix's $12 billion cash outlay on content in 2018, it still requires a level of scale for the investment to pay off. It might not need Netflix-like scale, but it needs more scale than the built-in Apple TV user base could offer.\nUltimately, however, Apple is sacrificing the opportunity to use TV+ as a selling tool for its hardware -- a strategy that was practically presumed until the recent announcement.\nBut the sacrifice might not be that big. Apple didn't mention any support for Android devices, so if users want to stream on mobile they might need to buy into the iOS ecosystem. And Apple generates much more revenue from iPhone and iPad sales than it does Apple TV. That revenue is very likely more profitable as well.\nIt's impossible to tell whether this strategy will result in a more profitable company. But considering the massive television audience outside of Apple's hardware reach and the relatively small size of Apple TV in the company's business, the risk is certainly worth it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roku", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ces", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T05:01:01.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "88a23e6e0dd1adbc776c647d763913efb6865ef9", "url": "https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/zenabis-global-inc-announces-resignation-of-donald-fairholm-from-board-of-directors-1028076533", "site_full": "markets.businessinsider.com", "site": "businessinsider.com", "site_section": "https://markets.businessinsider.com/news", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance", "options"], "section_title": "Stock Market News | Financial &amp; Business News | Markets Insider", "title": "Zenabis Global Inc.

In addition to gaining technologically advanced knowledge of plant propagation, the recent addition of state-of-the-art greenhouses in Langley provides Zenabis with 3.5 million square feet of facility space that can, upon full conversion, be dedicated to cannabis production.\nIf all facility space is fully built out and dedicated to production, Zenabis will own, and have access to, 660,000 square feet of high quality indoor cannabis production space, as well as 2.1 million square feet of greenhouse space at its Langley facility (an additional 700,000 square feet of greenhouse space will be used to continue the existing propagation business, to be converted at such a time that is beneficial to the strategic position of the company), strategically positioned on Canada's coasts. These facilities, if fully converted for cannabis production, would have the design capacity to yield 479,700 kg of dried cannabis annually, for both national and international market distribution. The Zenabis brand name is used among the medical market, while Namaste is used to service the adult use market.\nThe management team at Zenabis has significant experience in finance, agriculture, technology, pharmaceutical sales, consumer packaged goods, international distribution and brand marketing.\nZenabis has established distribution relationships with provincial liquor authorities, wholesalers and licensed retailers in nine provinces and territories ( British Columbia , Alberta , Saskatchewan , Manitoba , Quebec , New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , Prince Edward Island and the Yukon ).\nForward Looking Information\nThis news release contains statements that may constitute \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation.

We look forward to delivering results for Blockchain Holdings as soon as later this year.\u201d\n\u201cBlockchain Holdings is thrilled to collaborate with the leading container-based modular company on this project,\u201d said Delray Wannemacher, Chairman and CEO of Blockchain Holdings Capital Ventures. \u201cWe know SG Blocks will execute this to the highest level of quality and ensure our data centers are safe, secure structures \u2013 commanding the trust of our customers for years to come.\u201d\nWhile the majority of data centers will be fixed, BHCV will also be rolling out mobile data centers, which can be launched at much lower prices and often in a modular fashion\u2014allowing for additional capacities to be easily added as needed. The mobile data centers could be strategically placed in remote areas in reach of lower power prices, while still retaining the added benefit of being able to be relocated to regions of lower energy costs should the current prices become excessive.

Mr. Federico Tovar, our CFO will speak to the company's operating and financial results for the fourth quarter and the year-end for 2018. Dr. Bruno Wu, the Chairman of Ideanomics will address our investment community with his vision and strategy.\nAt the time, I will now have the conversation over to Mr. Alf Poor, Ideanomics\u2019 CEO.\nAlf Poor\nThank you, Tony. Good morning and thank you to everyone for joining our call. 2018 was a transformative year for the company and has set us on a firm foundation for 2019 and beyond. In addition to changes in our business operations, we also changed our company name in Q3, and Q4 to Ideanomics to better reflect our identity and position. This was an important step but we needed to capture the essence of our new organization and its mission statement. Ideanomics was chosen as a representator of convergence of innovation and prosperity, as well as in single word, it will be descriptive as well as deliver a unique brand identity.\nDuring the course of the year, it was necessary for the company to make changes to strengthen all aspects of the business. While we exceeded our revenue guidance, we accounted business challenges, the most significant of which was the delays in the much anticipated regulatory approvals for digital asset backed security purpose and some operational and management changes which caused our goals to slip in the second half of the year. This and our concern from wanting to distance ourselves from other questionable non-asset backed and non-regulated token raises caused us to postponed several token events in the second half of 2018 and in turn impacted our ability to deliver on our EBITDA guidance for longer the spike in professional services. These were one-time costs associated with deactivity from the Connecticut campus acquisition.\nIn addition, we experienced other costs associated with the part of executives amounting to $7 million and professional fees associated with transactions and investments conducted in relation to building out our Fintech Ecosystem.\nAll that said, the company did not seek to sit back and wait for the slow calls of the regulatory machine to get moving. In response, we increased our deal origination efforts and restructured deals to allow for traditional hybrid all-digital financing. So we are in a position to execute on our deal flow and generate strong revenues in 2019 and beyond.\nWe have been disappointed with the quality and availability of Western assets and our deal activities. This has caused us to continue to make use of our strategic advantage in Asian markets, where we have been able to source multiple high quality deals with assets in billions of dollars. With one or two exceptions, Asia is significantly further ahead in many high growth areas of opportunities, such as cleantech and greentech. And we have been impressed with the region's willingness to work with companies such as Ideanomics to help make those assets available as investment opportunities.\nOur Asia based deals are of significant size and scale that we believe they will serve as the benchmark to the Western world and position Ideanomics as a leading counterparty to European and North American asset holders to pursue their liquidity objectives.\nTo further deliver on our long-term vision, we announced the acquisition of the former University of Connecticut Campus in West Hartford in early October of 2018. This will serve as our global fintech innovation hub, and will be one of the several digital renaissance hubs across the globe. Dr. Wu will speak further on this subject in his portion of the call. We received tremendous interest in inquiries from partners, large and small, looking to participate in our hubs. And we are very excited to get West Hartford and the other hubs up and running as quickly as possible.\nOur efforts to commercialize our AI and blockchain technologies are beginning to bear fruit. So it has taken longer than anticipated to match new technologies with legacy infrastructure in areas such as logistics. Although responsible for a strong top-line revenues in 2018, our crude oil trading and electronics businesses do not yield profitability, although they did provide us a valuable use cases and insights into effective use of our technology. We will be divesting those assets those assets to focus on higher margin near term revenues and bringing the learnings into our other logistics initiatives in the future.\nIn addition to those, we have also made significant inroads into divesting what we refer to as our legacy assets and our media business. We have successfully sold off some of those legacy businesses, which will reflect in our Q1 2019 results, although the hard work to do so took place in 2018.\nWe purchased an ETF in the fourth quarter 2018, which focuses on electric vehicles and trades under the symbol EKAR. This was a precursor to some of the recent acquisition activity and we're working to adjust the basket of stocks within that ETF in order to provide the attractive investment opportunity in addition to carrying Ideanomics branding to the big board of the New York Stock Exchange.\nI would like to mention that we are very confident about all aspects of our business as we move through 2019. We are encouraged by the fact that we've been able to achieve a market leading position at a fraction of the cost of our competition. Factoring our data origination capabilities and a global focus, we believe we stand out from a majority of our competitors who are primarily focused on technology infrastructure outlook.\nWe will begin to onboard significant revenues for mid to late Q2, in what we refer to as our best period. We have asset backed refinancing programs for electric public transportation vehicles in cities such as Tianjin, China. The underwriting for these asset packaging has been finalized as we speak, part of which we'll see us reporting the assets on the blockchain. And what we believe is a first in the asset backed field, once completed the said instruments we bought to market in due course by our regional banking partner. But we have to be careful with providing specific guidance prior to having those revenues showing up fundamentals, we will be providing additional information in the coming weeks, as these revenues will obviously have a significant positive impact on our business.\nIn anticipation of this, we have begun a series of investor road shows and events, designed to help the investment community in terms of both retail and institutional investors, better understand these and our other revenue based deals and the mid to long-term value of Ideanomics\u2019 shareholders.\nWe are encouraged by the response to these events, which has resulted in ongoing interest and meetings with market makers and buyside institutions.\nI'd like to thank all of our investors for their support of Ideanomics. We have been working hard to provide increased transparency and better communication through our Investor Relations channel. And we will look forward to delivering significant shareholder value for each of these in the future. Thank you very much.\nFederico Tovar\nThank you, Tony. And thank you everyone for joining our call. 2018 was a transformational year marked by various investments across human capital, FinTech Village and the infrastructure needed to build out our Fintech Ecosystem. The US management team and the resources needed to position Ideanomics towards unlocking revenue through its fintech services activities. While we exceeded our top-line revenue guidance earlier in the year, we did not generate profit in the fourth quarter due to the transformation that the company is currently undergoing and the investments previously mentioned.\nNonetheless, we've had strong success, as we've achieved significant traction across the following areas:\nNumber one, the build out of a world class team in the US and in other parts of the world that have the global capital markets expertise, blockchain expertise, fintech expertise, as well as the regulatory and compliance expertise needed to succeed in our market.\nNumber two, significant customer deals that have been signed, further helping to validate our new business model and our position towards growth and profitability. These include the electrical bus deals, the auto financing deals, and many others, as well as our investment in FinTech Village. It is now time to execute and continue to build out these new digital asset products, and thereby reap the benefits of the technology ecosystem that we have been building out during the past several months.\nRevenue for the year, December 31, 2018 was $377.7 million, as compared to $144.4 million for the same period in 2017, representing an increase of approximately $233.3 million or 162%. The increase was mainly due to our Wecast business of crude oil trading initiated in October 2017 and partially offset in the amounts of $0.8 million by a decrease of our legacy YOD business.\nOur business strategy and the primary goal for entering the crude oil and consumer electronics is to learn about the needs of buyers and sellers in the industries that rely heavily on the shipping of goods. Our activities in the crude oil trading and consumer electronics business had been successful in various aspects. We generated revenue of $359.8 million for the first three quarters and have gained experience in the traditional logistics management and financing business, such that we have identified initial use cases for the applications of the technologies in our Fintech Ecosystem.\nWhile we have gained this experience, the company does not intend to be a logistics management company. Therefore, we decided to gradually start contracting our crude oil trading business and consumer electronics business starting in the third quarter of 2018 so that we can work towards enabling the application of our Fintech Ecosystem for other use cases that we have identified.\nIn parallel and for strategic reasons, during the course of the fourth quarter, we also chose to focus our resources and efforts on other non-crude oil trading and non-logistics management revenue generating opportunities that we have identified in the market as previously described by Alf. These other market opportunities also involve the use of our technologies across our Fintech Ecosystem and their applications across industry ventures.\nOur cost of revenues was $374.6 million for the year December 31, 2018, as compared to $137.2 million for the year ended December 31 2017. Our cost of revenues increased by $237.4 million, which is in line with our increase in revenues. Our cost of revenues is primarily comprised of the cost to purchase electronics products and crude oil from suppliers in our logistics management, and the cost of sales in the legacy YOD business, is primarily comprised of content licensing fees.\nGross profit for the year December 31, 2018 was approximately $3.2 million, as compared to $7.2 million during the same period in 2017. Our current crude oil and consumers electronic trading business operates in highly competitive global markets, characterized by aggressive price competition, resulting in downward pressure on already low margins.\nOur selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $22.5 million, as compared to $13.1 million for the same period in 2017, an increase of approximately $9.3 million or 71%. The majority of this increase was due to an increase in headcounts, human capital and relevant travelling expenses in the amount of $2.5 million, an increase of approximately $2.1 million in share-based compensation, an increase of approximately $3 million in consulting, legal, professional fees that were paid out to external consultants who provided various services with respect to our fintech and platform as a service business and an increase in our sales and marketing expense in the amount of $0.9 million relating to the introduction and promotion of our business models to various potential investors and business partners, as well as marketing of the Wecast Services business, an increase in rent expenses by $1 million mainly for our new corporate headquarters in New York City.\nProfessional fees are generally related to public company reporting and governance expenses, as well as legal fees related to business transition and expansion. Our professional fees increased approximately by $1.5 million or 48% for the year ended December 31 2018, compared with the same period in 2017. This increase was related to an increase in legal, valuation, audit and tax, as well as fees associated with the continuing build out of our technology ecosystem, and establishing strategic partnerships and M&A activity as part of this technology ecosystem.\nOur loss from operations was increased by $16.1 million to $26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $10.1 million during 2017. This was mostly due to the decrease in gross profit from our Wecast Services segment and the increase of operating expenses for the development of the Wecast Services business.\nLoss per share for 2018 was $0.35 per share as compared to $0.17 per share in 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the company had cash of $3.1 million, total assets of $94.2 million and total equity of $43.2 million.\nOver the past year, Ideanomics has been able to continue its transformation from its legacy business to be a prominent player for fintech services and asset digitization through establishing a global compliant network of financial technology, user [community] and digital asset production.\nOur team of seasoned digital strategists and technology leaders has positioned the company towards a path of unlocking fintech services related revenue for 2019. We have signed several customer revenue deals in our pipeline and our product and tech teams are diligently building out these new digital products to unlock this revenue in the near term, and position the company towards a strong 2019.\nThe company is committed to our successful product launches. These yields have the potential to add significant revenues and sustain the long-term viability of our business model.\nBruno Wu\nWell, thank you so much, Federico. I'm excited to be back and it is great to address the investor community as we are channelized again. Since late 2017 and during 2018, Ideanomics experienced new growth, new market positioning and a massive amount of interest in our new business alternatives.\nI will give you a summary of our strategy going forward to-date as well as provide context for our vision and strategy in 2019 and beyond. We believe that 2019 is going to be prove itself a year that will deliver on promise which is, we have to make just the biggest come back story ever in the NASDAQ history.\nInvestments we have made over the past 18 months have been essential to period as well as giving us strong foundation and future for growth of Ideanomics and our shareholders, a positive vision we are bringing to reality.\nOur ability to execute on large scale deal origination has continued during the first quarter of 2019 and we expect this to continue throughout 2019 and 2020, and this is the time to deliver results.\nWe've announced several deals with industry leaders which will serve as milestones for various success agreements which include APMEN deal, National Transport Capacity, [indiscernible], Treeletrik in Malaysia and GT Dollar Singapore among others. These deals represent only the beginning of Ideanomics of delivering solid financial results and will anchor our future revenue growth and business development.\nUsually we provide an update on the business operation to allow the 2019 roadmap to our community, which I would like to speak about on this call. In order to meet the market demand, the company has identified various ways it intends to develop as part of the overall fintech services strategy which are very complementary to both our Fintech Ecosystem and industry launches. These areas will focus primarily on key operating groups of Ideanomics.\nNumber one is AI Engine Group; number two is Digital Banking and Advisory Group; number three is Digital Asset Management Group.\nSo essentially we have to turn this into an AI driven next generation fintech service company, will serve as a -- for the transformative industries. So Ideanomics\u2019 Artificial Intelligence Engine Group starts with our BBD joint venture. It is part of our initiative to commercialize our AI and blockchain efforts for the benefit of high growth industries such as fintech, insurtech support.\nWe are in the middle of the marketing these activities under the brand [Intelligentech] which we will eventually make full clarification and announcement shortly. And that includes about over 20 mature products, AI platform based products we\u2019re able to offer to the world including the United States market and we\u2019re even in middle targeting some of the biggest banking and insurance organizations and deploying them.\nSo, our AI powered database which is fine tuned to the banking and insurance industries and available at both the PaaS Platform-as-a-Service and SaaS Software-as-a-Service enterprise solutions. We are also developing additional AI service offerings to non-commercial customers to furnish it with leading enterprise growth AI solutions provided that we are currently in negotiation with.\nThe second division is the Ideanomics Digital Banking and Advisory group. It will cover two key areas of operations, one in the digital renaissance innovation campus. As we have built and replenished programming hubs and capitalized programming hubs from five key global innovation centers, just like a planned fintech campus in West Hartford, Connecticut. So along with our planned fintech campuses in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia -- in KL, Malaysia soon to be announced innovation centers, the other locations, we still have in commercial innovation and technology investments, as well as ensure top-line deal flow with approximately over 100 companies to our Banking and Advisory Group. So modernization really provides technology support, provides capital market support and management advisory support in exchange for [indiscernible] high growth companies and a lot of these companies have been in innovation for 6, 7 years and are in the very mature growth period. So they're ready to go to capital market which we will benefit by being sort of a babysitter and mentor, leveraging technology, leveraging with them and business modeling and leveraging other resources and marketing.\nThese global innovation centers will foster the pipeline of technological experience in CleanTech, FinTech, treetech, agritech, labtech, insurtech, playtech for the industry\u2019s world\u2019s to pgrade cyber security companies and more, as well as our experience in origination efforts to stand below and we anticipate scaling these technologies into profitable companies within each sector of expertise to the point and our digital security effort for each respective company.\nThe second effort and largely on that we intend to beat a global asset backed debt exchange system. And we all know that in United States 75% of the social fund is achieved at fixed income base.\nIn China, that number is under 4% -- is around 4%, if you take that interbanking relationships it\u2019s probably under around 2%. It\u2019s pretty much the same situation across Asia which means that in Asia, we already have a massive effort, already beat that inability to convert them into group\u2019s fixed income asset backed security, which is CMBS, average fixed income component.\nSo, we are -- we have built a solid foundation of organization with a focus on securities, such as universities, CMBS, ABS [indiscernible] so on and so forth. We have now implemented AI backed -- AI based risk management and benchmarking for fixed income offerings with the technology that\u2019s really world leader. We are also in the middle banking advisory broker dealers in negotiations and one we already announced -- one key we already announced was CICC which is the China's biggest banker fourth year in a row.\nAnd we are now also being in insurance customer trading to investment debatch and also in partnership with the Singapore Exchange that\u2019s still in negotiations. So therefore, we believe that with these two factors of advisory businesses, we'd like to use -- we'd like to make Hong Kong and New York two partnering destinations for us to take other companies that we advise in our pipeline within hubs and take advisory groups and maximize our profit.\nIn the meantime, we also have Singapore as a primary place for the debt deal origination as well as secondary trading. So Ideanomics, lastly, is Ideanomics Digital Asset Management Group. This group provides large scale holders to assign cryptocurrencies such as GT Dollar, which is now trading north of [$900 billion] within Southeast Asian, primarily Chinese community. With de-risked asset-backed or benchmark value, we turn them into globally compliant, we provide digital advisory and business development services to stabilize and grow the value of their corporatives.\nThrough these unique groups which are AI, plus advisory, plus asset management, we intend to fully leverage our core business strategy, which is to promote use and development of AI based blockchain technologies. That technology leads us together with industry leaders and creating synergies in our Fintech Ecosystem and the business in our network of industry ventures.\nWe find tremendous energy in the Mainland China, there\u2019s opportunity that lie ahead. I want to say a very big thank you to all of our partners, vendors, Board members and management team who have worked tirelessly, with Alf and myself, to grow the platform of Ideanomics tremendous future success. I also want to thank our clients for allowing us to serve their needs, and shareholders for their support and to the Ideanomics everywhere for your integrating, your passion and your work ethic.\nAgain, let me end my talk today -- my presentation today by reiterating the comments I made before. We early came in October 2017 and I guess gone for 4, 5 months in the second half of 2019. In other words, I've done my job with the US-China trade talk, I\u2019m now back and we are on track of making this a greatest comeback story ever in the NASDAQ history. I am very confident on that.\nSo turning back to you Tony.\nTony Sklar\nThis concludes managent's prepared remarks. I will now turn the discussion back to our CEO Mr. Alf Poor, who'll be moderating the Q&A session.\nTony Sklar\nSo this is time, in the Q&A session that are people who are on the line if you'd like to begin asking your questions, you can do so through your computer. And as well, we will start off by answering some of the questions that have been emailed in.\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions]\nAlf Poor\nSo the first question we have here is regarding the GT Dollar relationship. A couple of things I do want to say to the market. It was like several questions in on this. First one is, yes, we will be recording the $170 million of upfront fees as a revenue event in Q1.\nSecond part of the question, there have been a lot of other questions coming into the Investor Relations mailbox regarding the 3% fee. Actually, Dr. Wu has been able to -- in our ongoing discussions with GT Dollar Group has been able to renegotiate that we get those fees on a monthly basis as they accrue as opposed to the provided fees at the end of the year. So we will get a little bit of an uplift there in terms of the ability to have recognized those revenues as they come in month-by-month.\nTony Sklar\nWe've got a next question from [Jim Mitchell, Rob].\nOperator\nYes. Mr. [Mitchell], you may begin.\nUnidentified Analyst\nHi. I guess to expand on what Alf just said there with the collaboration with GT Dollar. Can you talk more about what you'll be doing to earn the 3% fee, which is pretty large, just under $3 billion if we calculated today? And I guess, going with what you just said, how would you shoulder the cost of doing this business throughout the year if you don't get the monthly payments?\nBruno Wu\nOkay. So, let me answer that. First of all, I think GT Dollar from its inception has pursued a different route than any other token offerings anywhere in the world. It always sought for underlying asset to back what it was doing. So -- and throughout last year, we had a lot of money, I think north of $0.5 billion in cash and now that daily trading volume is also huge, it ranges from $70 million, $80 million $90 million to a few hundred million dollars.\nSo, our job as we had developed a very thorough plan of at least top unanimously with the blockchain RFP and officials of monetary authorities of the regulators, top blockchain in the United States, we've discussed to modernize how to turn this into a world\u2019s first leading stable and a settlement token that's really tied to the efforts. Actually we have a plan to wait and we have a very detailed price, which I'm not able to share today, but I think this is a game changer. It is a game changer, and GT Dollar\u2019s value is approaching bitcoin but it is very, very difficult and very, very different, because it has already asset backing.\nI mentioned and to tell you as we have figured out a system and to partner with the major front out of the region, out of Singapore to use a mechanism that the investment in the token will lead to investment in the effort and with stability to convert to real money, all into one regulated component system. Of course, beyond Singapore we have also done announcement and plus other announcement, we will in the middle of \u201819 -- and we have to earn a fee month-by-month, that\u2019s what we are really working very diligently on.\nBut, so we are -- I guess how much I can say and you'll see how traditional leading institutions are jumping with those ideas. You\u2019ll see how our fintech and AI technology can provide liquidity and helping to personalize [indiscernible] other FTA offerings, personalized ABS and make the product more available under regulatory compliant environment. So it is not just Singapore, which has the high standard, we are trying to be GT Dollar to become very compliant to that. We're also looking for other jurisdictions, London is another one, Abu Dhabi is another one, Hong Kong is another one, United States of course is another one. So we are looking for regulatory compliance in all those five primary markets.\nUnited States we are hoping against FTA regulations came in a little late than what we anticipated for as Tony and Federico alluded to that. Because we wanted to pull out -- we have sort of committed to ourselves where we put out to it, because we didn't want to be -- unless we want to differentiate ourselves from -- and the small premier pipeline focused situation that\u2019s what I said from day one, tokenization as a key condition of token offering in the future.\nWe are taking a very good experiment with GT Dollar but our effort with that business start with the GT Dollar because we are also looking at other massive FTA offerings that the value went down for the call it -- GT Dollar, it's very, very stable, very, very strong space on trading but we also recognize that many tokens because they didn\u2019t follow, break the rules, didn\u2019t understand why, underlying efforts are leading and takeaway message that another regulation, the message that another regulated financial instrument. It just gives a quicker and smarter way of personalized way of distributing and trading it. And so in order to aiding and failing a certain fo these big ventures that are financed we like to offer talk -- start some of the conversation. We can really either with an effort becoming a [indiscernible] can save them and their shareholders. So that's of the GT Dollar. So we have to earn the fundamental basis, too high per month.\nUnidentified Analyst\nThat was fantastic.\nAlf Poor\nI want to make sure -- just to answer the question there. Originally that came in from the caller. There is going to be some operational uplifting costs that we are going to be establishing operations in Singapore to support GT Dollar, it's going to be our job to help them manage the size of their token coins bond, this is going to be our responsibility in market that's the payment that\u2019s expected outside of just the Asian region and also to help get listed on other international exchanges as well. But sufficed to say, it's a transformative deal for us. The cost base will still leave us with tremendously high margins. Not to say that we're a one trick pony. That's something that we moved very quickly to secure, it's build up and takeaway from the other large scale deals that we have in the asset equity financing and other. So we're expecting 2019 to be extremely rewarding year for the company in terms of revenues.\nOperator\nWe're going to take the next question from [Stephen Franco].\nUnidentified Analyst\nCan you talk about your agreement with CICC and the underwriters -- and the other underwriters for the underwriting of the electric buses? Just can you drill down a bit as to when you're going to start to receive revenues? How much money will you make on this, things all of those nature -- things along those lines, please?\nBruno Wu\nFantastic question and let me take a shot at that. And Alf you can jump in afterwards. So the electronic bus based revenue is part of our greentech technology and greentech based device sales. We have two major revenue sources. Originally when done the deal as we see, we are going to share because basically ABS -- CICC can sell ABS of 6% to 7%. This triple A rated then this 5% to 6% as to double A it's 6% to 7%. Currently the banking -- the banks are providing funding leasing financing companies 7% to 8% and leasing financing companies sort of major auto -- leading auto makers are providing to the cities at 9%. Hence we have 2% arbitrage in between.So we therefore, we come in and we say hey, look we organize that ABS at 2% arbitrage with national companies like [indiscernible] National Transport Capacity and CICC. So basically we got to a tariff of just 1% for CICC. But that CICC -- so we play two roles for CICC. Number one is we acquire customers. Now when we acquired customers today, not only we go with the new originated deals, new deal originations like Tianjin and so on and so forth. And as you know, these originations take a long time to deliver because you have to first of all deliver the bus and then get your financial leasing deal done, before you have to have that. Before you have to have an access to full ABS without A everything is BS, okay. So we have done asset first. So that's take a little bit time. So together with CICC and we are in the middle of conversation with China's by far the biggest EU bus marker which actually bus marker is Beijing Auto. And also Mercedes and all that stuff. And now we are in the middle of working with them and so we can take the leverage fee on leasing financial deals on the book which is [biddings]. And we say hey while these financials, so one -- so we're doing two things in parallel in a financial [indiscernible] as we take 1% on the legacy book, the book of the legacy existing business sets a lot. And number two is we wait for the new -- newly originated deals to come through which takes a little bit of time, so $5 billion to a $7 billion deal for Tianjin will probably take a year to 18 months before it serves at all.\nSo, and ABS is always the last guy to come in. So that's the 1% part, the ABS commission part, okay, and we earn it by providing service, both customer acquisition and fintech service.\nNow, we're also very excited about part 2. Part 2 is now together with NTC and also by our own ability, we are now capable of acquiring a new and the right model of making buses happen ourselves. So that's where we get decommissioned. That commission typical is about 15% for us by selling new buses. As you know that these buses is much more much simpler than regular buses much less part as with battery and everything else. So the margin on sales is high.\nSo we're now trying to ramp up that and it become better either, will put together go together NTC become the leaders of selling. So our internal goal is to try to tell between 40,000 to 60,000 units this year if we could. That means it's 40b to 60b. So roughly US$6 billion to US$9 billion, US$10 billion. Now, that said, it\u2019s a very -- I feel that\u2019s the target. We're trying to assess. So we're working very closely with the China's top policy makers to make it happen. After all, China has the national regulation, that all these stuff is need to be converted EV at least 4 to 5 deals to cover EV by end of next year.\nSo in reality, I don't think, all China's 1.8 million buses can be turned into this theses types, takes too much to deliver and to finance the manufacturing even. So, we just still have -- some other words, our revenue is 1% plus 15%, out of the sales, 1% of ABS, okay, that\u2019s domestic China.\nNow -- we are now getting into the Malaysian market, which tomorrow has a very big call, because they're, we've been able to get our top 6 or 7 biggest retailers to come with us into Malaysia, because for assembling we are the only license holder in Malaysia and we will launch good candidates work for industrial park in Malaysia, China Industrial Park, that's very big way with the [indiscernible].\nSo that again, a 15% plus one 1% for us. And there\u2019s more leverage in Malaysia, because the financial rate is much lower in China. China is 9% to 10% out of the gate for the ECs. Malaysia banking, banks are providing 3% to 5%. So since about 3% to 4% lower than the Chinese banking rates. So we'll make these Southeast Asian countries very lucrative for us and no tariff in between. So we look this as a very big revenue driver for us in the next 12 to 18 months on the Cleantech front.\nAlf Poor\nThanks, Bruno. So just a recap for everybody here on the call, really 3 main streams for us from these electric vehicle deals. One is the commission from the financing and the refinancing. That's going to be low margin. But fortunately for us, we're dealing with large Asia population. So that deal is a big and $0.5 billion attached to them. And second part is commissioned from the vehicles sales themselves. And the third part is we will be getting an annuity in terms of commissioning the charging stations as well. So we're involved in helping establish and we have some exclusivity in some of the regions we operate as regards to charging station infrastructure as well.\nWe do anticipate this, we've got a number of e-mails and talking about what is cost base for this? We're operating very much as an enabler here. So we anticipate all these to be high margin businesses. We have had some quite high start-up costs compared to revenues in the last couple of years as we\u2019ve built the business. But going forward, I think we see other than regional operational costs, which will be reasonable we do expect this to be very high margin business for us.\nBruno Wu\nYes. Absolutely. I mean, we see a very good point, because EV business selling costs and servicing cars, servicing the hardware is only half of the game. The other half of the game is in the digital service that\u2019s the charging. The soft service going forward and in a perfect position because we're exclusive in one place, and we'll see an announcement coming even in our Chinese operations and Malaysian operation and Vietnam operation which we're launching.\nSo I can say that in the fintech, greentech bus will be the game changer. And honestly, I think regarding passenger EV vehicles, you've got Grande Porsche, Mercedes, BMW, Tesla and so on and so forth. But as far as Ev platform specialty vehicles, the China has the scalability, has the technology, everything in technology, so it is the mover. And we're very happy to be innovative with our model, we are very happy to take EV worldwide with the next generation EV model. And that model worked everywhere, worked in Connecticut, worked in City of New York, worked in Tianjin, China, worked in Malaysia, it's a model that makes very, very happy.\nAlf Poor\nI think, if you -- a good way for the market to digest the system, Bruno said at the beginning which is really we have three core engines which are driving our revenues. We have the AI and commercialization of the AI and blockchain technologies, but the digital banking advisory group and we have the Digital Asset Management Services. So these are very 3 distinctly different revenue streams for us. These are asset management service, think of that as GT Dollar deal, separate division at digital banking, that's going to be our electrical bus and auto refinancing and our other revenue streams there.\nAnd then there's business around the AI and the commercialization of blockchain so fintech and [geotech] and others. So we're going to be building these 3 divisions very aggressively this year. We do operate a very lean model, we have a lot of start-up costs and they are part of the course when you're acquiring companies and doing deals like we do, you do get a tremendous amount of professional service and travel cost come in. Now we've got the majority of the pieces of the puzzle in place. Now it's time for us to make hay while the sun shines. Do we have any other questions Tony?\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] We have no additional phone questions at this time.\nTony Sklar\nGreat. That's fantastic. All right. Well, then that's all we have time for today. And this concludes the Ideanomics fourth quarter 2018 investor earnings conference call.

It would be better to call them AirPods 1.1.", "text": "1 day ago\nAfter months of speculation and noise of all kinds, the second generation of AirPods has finally been tacitly unveiled. Contrary to what I expected, however, the AirPods 2 are not exactly what I imagined. All the information about a black variant, a new design and biometric functions were wrong. So much so that I started to think that these should actually be called AirPods 1.1.\nMy first disappointment about the new generation of AirPods was caused by the almost identical design to the previous ones which, I would like to remind you, is now two years old. Many reports, moreover, had made more and more users believe that this time there would be a black version (or Matte Black, as Apple fans like it) followed by other colors and a new design that would give owners a more secure fit in the ear to avoid accidental falls. The wireless charging cover seems to be what users are most interested in. / \u00a9 Apple\nAs for this last point, there is little new. This is the design that Apple has chosen (without too much effort), while with regards to colors there is still a possibility: many of the products under the Apple brand get new colors months after their launch on the market, which is why Apple could still play this card in a few months, perhaps during the presentation of the new iPhone. The best running watches you can buy to get fit in 2019\nThe real update of this year's AirPods is undoubtedly the new charging case that is able to enjoy the feature of wireless charging, compatible with the Qi standard. However, just to show you how \"different\" the new AirPods are from the previous ones, the new cover can be purchased separately for $80 and can also be used to recharge the old Apple AirPods.\nThe only good news is that the new model of AirPods costs exactly the same price as the previous generation, so $159, but... without the new charging case, of course. At this price you will find in fact the classic old charging case, so you'll have to spend a little more to get the new one with your AirPods ($200). All these reasons have prompted most users to opt for the wireless charging cover alone rather than buying the whole new kit. The new H1 chip allows you to use Siri directly from AirPods. / \u00a9 Apple\nOverall, therefore, the features of the AirPods 2 are not so interesting as to stimulate the purchase of the new package proposed by Apple, much less just the headphones despite having kept the same price of the previous model. The new H1 chip inside them is undoubtedly a step forward and allows owners to get a custom sound architecture to enjoy a better sound experience and better synchronization. How to fix a phone that won't charge properly\nIn fact, the new chip guarantees connection times between Apple devices and AirPods twice as fast as before and, thanks to lower power consumption, for about one hour longer than before. On the contrary, if used for listening to music, the battery life still remains at five hours in total. Autonomy aside, the good thing about the H1 chip is that it allows you to charge your headphones faster than before. But should all this really be enough to convince users to buy the new model?\nMaybe Apple will keep its last trick up their sleeve. After seeing some screenshots of a secret screen in the iOS 12.2 beta last month, it was pretty much obvious that the new AirPods would integrate Siri on board. In fact, thanks to the new chip you can say the words \"Hey, Siri\" in order to use Apple's virtual assistant directly from your headphones, a feature already seen with Microsoft on its Surface Headphones. Microsoft Surface Headphones allow you to interact with Cortana via headset. / \u00a9 Microsoft\nIn short, in my opinion, there is really nothing revolutionary and many owners of the old model can safely refrain from opening their wallets once again. On the contrary, if I were in the shoes of someone who bought a couple of old AirPods a short time ago I would not be at all happy, indeed I would be furious. There's no such thing as the best Bluetooth headphones\nAt the same time, however, there is little to get angry about and you also have to put yourself in the shoes of Apple: why should the design of the most popular earphones in the world be changed?

The quickest is to trigger Siri and ask, \"What's my heart rate?\" The Heart Rate app will launch and present your current heart rate within a few seconds.\nThe other method is to manually launch the Heart Rate app, either via the app icon or using the Heart Rate complication on a watch face.\nThe Heart Rate app on the watch shows a small graph of recorded heart rates, or you can visit the Health app on your iPhone ( $1,000 at Amazon ) to view a larger, more detailed version of the graph.\nA-fib and EKG features Screenshots by Jason Cipriani/CNET When Apple announced the Apple Watch Series 4 and its new heart rate features, the company mentioned the features would be enabled in a future update. That update was released in December, adding an ECG app to the Apple Watch Series 4, and atrial-fibrillation alerts to older Apple Watch models.\nECG and EKG are both short for electrocardiogram; EKG is more commonly used in the US, but Apple uses ECG for the feature.\nNow playing: Watch this: We tested the Apple Watch EKG against a hospital EKG 4:28 Before either feature will show up on your watch, you'll need to update to WatchOS 5.1.2, and to iOS 12.1.1 on your iPhone. Once that's done, open the Health app on your iPhone and follow the prompts to set up each feature. Series 4 users may need to open the Health app more than once to get the prompt for the ECG feature and Afib alerts.\nRead more about using the ECG app here .\nHigh or low heart rate alerts Screenshots by Jason Cipriani/CNET If you have an Apple Watch Series 1 ( $190 at Amazon ) or newer, WatchOS 5 is compatible and will work on your watch. The update adds a handful of new features, one of which is the ability to detect a low heart rate and bring it to your attention.\nTo adjust your heart rate thresholds, high or low, open the Watch app on your iPhone and select Heart Rate from the list of settings.\nIn the Heart Rate section, you can set the limits which will prompt the watch to alert you.\nFor example, if you set the High heart rate alert to 110 beats per minute (bpm), if your watch detects your heart is beating above 110bpm after you've been inactive for 10 minutes, you will receive an alert on the watch. The same can be said about the low heart rate setting -- if your heart is beating below your set threshold for 10 minutes, you will receive an alert.\nFirst published Sept. 24.\nUpdate, Dec. 17 : Adds details about A-fib and ECG features.\nApple Watch gets FDA-cleared EKG features 9 Photos Mentioned Above Apple Watch Series 4 GPS (40mm silver aluminum case, white sport band) $384 See it $384 Amazon See It $399 Apple See It $399 Adorama See It CNET may get a commission from retail offers.\nApple Watch Series 4 Review \u2022 Apple Watch Series 4 review: ECG, and a lot of refinements Preview \u2022 Apple Watch Series 4 review in progress (updated) How To \u2022 Apple Watch Series 4: How to use the ECG app News \u2022 Apple Watch Series 4 vs. Series 3: Which watch should you buy?

It\u2019s also the one time in the year businesses and brands can trick their customers, and some get really creative. We\u2019ve browsed through the internet for some of the best ones posted in the realm of Philippine social media today and here are some of them. Get ready for some good ol\u2019 Pinoy humor. Dunkin\u2019 Donuts Photo: Dunkin\u2019 Donuts/FB More Dunkin\u2019 Donuts knows how much Filipinos love its choco butternut donuts, so it made a pretty heartbreaking joke that all the donuts in this flavor were phased out. It says in the photo: \u201cDue to a global Butternut shortage, our Choco Butternut donuts will be PHASED OUT.\u201d It the caption, however, it revealed that it was all just a (sick) joke . You broke our hearts, DD. Maxx Filipinos love milk tea, so much so that menthol candy Maxx finally came up with a decent solution to our milk tea hankerings \u2014 a milk tea-flavored menthol candy. If you\u2019re ever in a pinch and trying to cut down costs, this is the candy you need. If only it actually exists. Photo: Maxx/FB More D\u2019 Cream Coffee & Tea Speaking of milk tea, another local shop by the name D\u2019 Cream Coffee & Tea posted that its bestselling Golden Sun milk tea is also phased out. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say goodbye but due to [the] dairy crisis, our bestseller GOLDEN SUN will be PHASED OUT,\u201d it says in the graphic posted on Facebook. Photo: D\u2019Cream Coffee & Tea/FB More Quit playing games with our hearts. The Bar Photo: The Bar/FB More Ever wonder what your favorite Pinoy summer treats taste like if they were alcoholic? No? Well, here\u2019s a teaser anyway. The Bar\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d alcoholic offerings include mais con yelo (mix of shaved ice, corn kernels, sugar and milk), halo-halo (mix of crushed ice, evaporated milk, ube, sweetened beans, sago, seaweed gelatin, fruit slices, flan, usually topped with a scoop of ice cream), and taho (soybean curd drink). Pretty sure this will eff with our taste buds and will make us retch badly. Potato Corner Matcha-flavored apple-sliced fake fries. Photo: Potato Corner/FB More Beloved french fries stall Potato Corner shared a step-by-step guide to pranking a loved one with apple sliced-fake fries. All you have to do is put the apple-slices with the flavored powder that your friend likes (ex. Matcha) and you\u2019re all set. We\u2019re down for the plan. KFC The prank we wished wasn\u2019t a prank. Photo: KFC Philippines/FB More KFC pretended to make the dreams of meat-lovers come true : a Quadruple Down aka double its Double Down. A Double Down\u2019s sandwich is formed with two pieces of fried chicken fillet rather than hamburger buns \u2014 with bacon, cheese, and a special sauce. So imagine if this baby right here were real. We\u2019re pretty bummed that this it isn\u2019t, but it\u2019s probably for the best, health-wise. Default: Cafe Pub Photo: Default: Cafe Pub/FB More People will pray before and after they drink up this shot posted by the Manila-based cafe pub called Default. Based on its description, the fake drink is 100 percent ethyl alcohol, with Jose Cuervo tequila, Emperador brandy, J\u00e4germeister, Red Horse, Gin, and Bacardi 151. Some netizens call it the \u201cGoodbye Philippines\u201d drink. Don\u2019t drink it, if you want to live. Good thing it\u2019s not real. Which April Fools\u2019 joke was your favorite?

Marks Its 50-Year Anniversary 3 hrs ago\nMEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr 1, 2019--As Memphis celebrates its 200 th anniversary, well-known corporate citizen Duncan-Williams, Inc. marks a momentous milestone as well \u2014 50 years of serving the nation\u2019s investors from its Memphis home.\nFounded in 1969 by A. Duncan Williams, the firm started out as a small regional municipal bond firm, selling bonds for public projects to small-town banks and other fixed-income investors around the country. Duncan-Williams, Inc., and other Memphis-based bond firms helped propel the city into a major capital of the national bond industry \u2014 a distinction Memphis still holds.\nTragedy struck the firm in 1989 with the sudden death of A. Duncan Williams. But the principles he built the business on 20 years earlier served it well as his wife Carolyn Williams took the helm. \u201cWe had the trust of our customers, the experience of long-term and loyal employees, and the respect of our competitors,\u201d she recalled.\nThe business continued to thrive under Carolyn Williams, who led the company for 11 years, and still remains its major stockholder and Board Chairwoman. Carolyn and Duncan\u2019s son, Duncan F. Williams, became CEO in 2000, and by 2010 the firm had 170 employees and offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Charlotte, Seattle, Cleveland, Atlanta, and other cities. Duncan-Williams, Inc. then went on to spin off a highly successful private client business called Duncan Williams Asset Management.\nAs CEO, Duncan Williams has also leaned into his family\u2019s commitment to the community, sponsoring countless community organizations and causes.\n\u201cOur business is complex, but our approach has always been simple,\u201d Duncan Williams said. \u201cWhen our clients do well, our employees do well. And when our employees do well, our company does well. And because our company does well, we can do so much more to make sure Memphis does well.\u201d\nFor more information about Duncan-Williams, Inc., visit www.duncanwilliams.com .\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190401005955/en/\nCONTACT: Gary Lendermon", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "a. duncan williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carolyn williams", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "inc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tenn.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "memphis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "memphis", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T06:00:36.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "daec088ea283c1b5627e8bb47b389986e45532e8", "url": "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190401005927/en/", "site_full": "www.businesswire.com", "site": "businesswire.com", "site_section": "http://www.valdostadailytimes.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=100&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&nsa=eedition&c%5B%5D=news,news/*&f=rss", "site_categories": ["jewelry_making", "media", "hobbies_and_interests", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "www.valdostadailytimes.com - RSS Results in news,news/* of type article", "title": "3M Announces Upcoming Investor Event", "title_full": "3M Announces Upcoming Investor Event", "published": "2019-04-02T01:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/valdostadailytimes.com/content/tncms/custom/image/7d368070-0339-11e6-b6b3-b7bc77615a64.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5013, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "daec088ea283c1b5627e8bb47b389986e45532e8", "url": "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190401005927/en/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T01:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "3M Announces Upcoming Investor Event", "text": "3M Announces Upcoming Investor Event 4 hrs ago\nST.

You know here at Allwomenstalk that a good many of our writers regularly extol the benefits of Apple Cider Vinegar . The laundry list of benefits of ACV for your health runs from acne prevention to weight loss and everything in between. Many of us use apple cider vinegar at home for various reasons and generally we take it in water as a weight loss aid or to boost our metabolism in the morning, stave off hunger between meals, and some of us use it topically in our handmade beauty products (big up to you if you make your own!). ACV is a great rinse for hair. After washing and conditioning it helps keep your locks luscious and shiny. This is easy enough to do but what makes apple cider vinegar good for your hair ? The pH level (here\u2019s the science bit: the dictionary definition of pH is \u201ca figure expressing the acidity or alkalinity of a solution on a logarithmic scale on which 7 is neutral, lower values are more acid and higher values more alkaline\u201d) of apple cider vinegar is similar to that of hair which means it will not alter or tamper with the natural pH balance of your locks. And, because ACV has anti-microbial, anti-fungal, and anti-yeast properties, it can help clean bacteria and other microscopic organisms from your hair. This also applies to your skin, so it\u2019s even good for your scalp, even helping to prevent dandruff. So, while I don\u2019t mind using apple cider vinegar as a rinse, I was chuffed when I found that there\u2019s shampoo and conditioner where ACV is the main active ingredient. And it\u2019s not just me who loves this idea. Health.com reported that, \u201caccording to Google Trends, searches for Wow Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo have increased by 750% recently. What's more, the brand's conditioner has reached \"breakout\" status, meaning searches for it have grown more than 5,000%.\u201d That\u2019s a pretty amazing reaction to a single brand. It has more than 1,000 reviews on Amazon and is available in the US and the UK. But it\u2019s not the only brand. Do a quick search for apple cider vinegar and you\u2019ll find brands like Aveena, Luseta, Beauty and the Bees, Fekkai, Hair Dance, Natural Hair, and John Masters Organics producing shampoos, conditioners, rinses and other hair treatments based on ACV. I\u2019m definitely going to try some ACV shampoo and conditioner to control my frizz! (p.s. I am not affiliated with any of the brands mentioned in this article \u2013 just passing on information I know you\u2019ll find useful.)

But on Monday, Saudi Aramco opened its books, revealing that it generated US$111.1 billion (S$150.6 billion) in net income in 2018, making it the world's most profitable company by far.\nIt's profit was almost double that of Apple (US$59.5 billion in 2018) and more than than JP Morgan Chase, Google-parent Alphabet, Facebook and Exxon Mobil combined. Put together, those companies made nearly US$106 billion in 2018, according to CNBC.\nThe disclosure reveals a company that is hugely profitable but also tightly bound to one country and the price of oil.\nAramco issued the financial data in a prospectus as it prepares to borrow up to US$15 billion through a bond sale, in what could signal a more aggressive approach to capital-raising for both the company and Saudi Arabia, which is seeking to cut its dependence on oil and gas revenue.\nThe money will help finance Aramco's US$69 billion purchase of most of a state-owned petrochemical company from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, whose chairman is Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\nThe crown prince wants to diversify Saudi Arabia's economy, and the sovereign wealth fund has been investing in technology companies like Uber and Tesla as a way of doing so. A planned stock sale in 2018 by Aramco was expected to raise money for that purpose, but it was postponed.\nThe sale of a stake in Saudi Basic Industries, the petrochemical company, appears to be an alternative way to raise the funds.\nWhile the crown prince pursues new investments and tries to recover from the political fallout caused by the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, Aramco also appears to be trying to make itself into a broader energy producer and, thus, more attractive if the government decides once again to try to sell a slice of the company.\nAramco CEO Amin Nasser has said that the company is pursuing international acquisitions in areas such as liquefied natural gas, a chilled fuel that, like oil, can be transported globally on ships.\nThe financial results also show how the company's fortunes rise and fall with the price of oil. In 2016, for instance, a time of low prices, the company reported only US$13.3 billion in net income.\nFor investors, Aramco's ties to the Saudi government are also a persistent concern. \"Unlike Exxon and Chevron, its revenue streams are highly dependent on a single country that could face real instability risks,\" Ayham Kamel, an analyst at Eurasia Group, a consulting firm, wrote in a recent note to clients.\nBut analysts said that the financial information revealed on Monday showed that Aramco had plenty of firepower for more deals.\nAramco has \"a huge amount of room\" to issue debt, said David Staples, a managing director at Moody's Investors Service, which issued a credit rating for Aramco on Monday.\nStaples and a colleague, Rehan Akbar, noted that the company had already achieved enormous size and profitability without borrowing or selling stock to investors. In 2018, Aramco paid about US$160 billion to the government in dividends, taxes and royalties.\nMoody's attributed Aramco's profitability in part to economies of scale stemming from enormous production volumes extracted from oil and gas assets of unmatched size. Aramco has some of the world's largest oil fields, leading to very low costs.\n\"Aramco's scale of production in combination with its vast hydrocarbon resources is a very strong competitive advantage,\" Moody's analysts wrote.\nThe prospectus reveals some long-hidden details about the size of Saudi Arabia's oil fields. Chief among these is a monster called Ghawar, which extends for about 120 miles in the eastern part of the country. The world's largest oil field, according to the prospectus, Ghawar has accounted for more than half Saudi Arabia's cumulative production yet it still has reserves of 48 billion barrels and is capable of producing nearly four million barrels a day, both more than all but a handful of countries.\nThe oil wealth doesn't stop there. The kingdom has four more fields that dwarf most others.\nAramco produced 13.6 million barrels per day in 2018 on average, more than three times the 3.8 million barrels per day reported by Exxon Mobil, according to the report. Overall, its revenue was about US$360 billion.\nMoody's wrote that Aramco was \"conservatively managed\" with \"very low debt levels.\"\nStaples said that based on his conversations with Aramco officials, he expected this careful approach to debt to continue, a policy that is likely to find favor with investors if the Saudi government decides to revive its IPO plans.\nThe agency rated the company A1, a strong rating but below that of large Western oil companies including Exxon Mobil and Shell. Staples said the lower rating reflected the concentration of most of Aramco's operations in Saudi Arabia, which shares the same credit rating, and the government's dependence on oil and gas revenue.\nThe thinking is that if Saudi Arabia were to encounter political instability or hard times, the oil company would feel the impact. \"We have to take into account the risk profile\" of the country, he said.\nThe company, founded by US oil companies (Aramco is short for Arabian American Oil Co), was nationalized by the Saudi government in the 1970s.\nIn its prospectus, Aramco listed some of the risks and drawbacks that it faced in its operations. The Saudi government, for instance, determines how much oil Saudi Aramco should produce \"based on its sovereign energy security goals or for any other reason.\" The company also may face litigation over climate change or antitrust issues stemming from its membership in the Opec, especially in the United States, Aramco's prospectus said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "aramco", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nytimes", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "saudi aramco", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal dutch shell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sabic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "exxon mobil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aramco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi basic industries", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi aramco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T06:25:19.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e020b3673e30c86af3ee523ec82dc4611799b8ed", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/news/3447579-eidos-restate-2018-financials", "site_full": "seekingalpha.com", "site": "seekingalpha.com", "site_section": "http://seekingalpha.com/market_currents.xml", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "mutual_funds"], "section_title": "Breaking News on Seeking Alpha", "title": "Eidos to restate 2018 financials - Eidos Therapeutics, Inc.

Samsung\u2019s latest phones feature a variety of bleeding-edge upgrades , including 5G connectivity, quad rear cameras, Infinity-O displays, and two-way wireless charging. Apple will no doubt bring some of these features to its next flagship phones, but at least one has been all but confirmed by the always reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo this week in an investor note.\nAccording to Kuo, Apple will bring two-way wireless charging (also known as bilateral or reverse charging) to its next iPhone models, expected to launch this fall. Two-way wireless charging will let the iPhone charge other devices, such as the new AirPods wireless charging case, and all three models are said to have this ability.\nRelated stories\nApple is doing something in China it almost never does: Cutting iPhone prices\nApple's upcoming credit card is a lot cooler than you might think\nApple officially cancels AirPower\nHere\u2019s a Quote: from Kuo\u2019s investor note, in which he notes that Apple is a bit late to the party:\nWe expect the new 2H19 iPhone models will support two-way wireless charging. Though the iPhone is not the first high-end smartphone to be equipped with two-way wireless charging, this new function could make it more convenient for users to charge the new AirPods and create a better integrated user experience of the iPhone and AirPods.\nAlso in the note, via 9to5Mac , Kuo says that Apple will increase the size of the battery in each new iPhone model to accommodate two-way charging. The battery in the 5.8-inch iPhone (the follow-up to the iPhone XS) will apparently receive a 20-25% bump, while the 6.5-inch iPhone XS Max sequel will have a 10-15% increase in battery capacity. Meanwhile, the 6.1-inch model is said to only be receiving an 0.5% enlargement.\nApple insider claims 2019 iPhones will have two-way wireless charging ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/2sWn6fZ", "https://bgr.com/2019/03/29/airpower-release-cancelled-overheating-problems/", "http://bit.ly/2RZO3hQ", "http://bit.ly/2UxKn3I&quot;", "https://bgr.com/2019/04/01/apple-card-credit-score-virtual-number/&quot;", "https://pages.email.bgr.com/newsletters/?source=nypost&quot;", "https://bgr.com/2019/04/01/apple-cuts-prices-china-iphone/", "https://bgr.com/2019/03/29/airpower-release-cancelled-overheating-problems/&quot;", "https://pages.email.bgr.com/newsletters/?source=nypost", "http://bit.ly/2sWn6fZ&quot;", "https://bgr.com/2019/04/01/iphone-11-two-way-wireless-charging-feature/", "http://bit.ly/2UxKn3I", "https://bgr.com/2019/04/01/iphone-11-two-way-wireless-charging-feature/&quot;", "https://bgr.com/2019/02/27/galaxy-s10-review-samsung-s10-plus-specs-features/", "https://bgr.com/2019/04/01/apple-card-credit-score-virtual-number/", "https://bgr.com/2019/02/27/galaxy-s10-review-samsung-s10-plus-specs-features/&quot;", "https://bgr.com/2019/04/01/apple-cuts-prices-china-iphone/&quot;", "http://bit.ly/2RZO3hQ&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kuo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ming-chi kuo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T07:35:18.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bdac1be09a93cedafc23142276c46a43c222b5bc", "url": "https://ph.news.yahoo.com/38-portable-power-bank-charges-200806530.html", "site_full": "ph.news.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://ph.news.yahoo.com/tech", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "media", "tech"], "section_title": "Tech | Yahoo News Phillipines", "title": "This $38 portable power bank charges your iPhone while wirelessly charging your Apple Watch", "title_full": "This $38 portable power bank charges your iPhone while wirelessly charging your Apple Watch", "published": "2019-04-01T15:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "news", "country": "PH", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/T74rsFiciJVnz3yqPKtQaA--~B/aD01NjY7dz04MzU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.news.bgr.com/7ac44927160bab52a6b0d21c8f7b38f8", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bdac1be09a93cedafc23142276c46a43c222b5bc", "url": "https://ph.news.yahoo.com/38-portable-power-bank-charges-200806530.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Maren Estrada", "published": "2019-04-01T15:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "This $38 portable power bank charges your iPhone while wirelessly charging your Apple Watch", "text": "If you have an Apple Watch you obviously also have an iPhone because otherwise the watch is useless.

That shortfall, you may remember, was attributed in large part to lower than anticipated iPhone sales volume in China, which is why it was revealed on Monday that Apple has decided to do something pretty unlike Apple in order to try and make up for it.\nThe solution: Cut prices. A CNBC report Monday notes that Apple took the action earlier this year on official third-party sellers in China like Tmall and JD.com. That report also speculates that Monday\u2019s price cut may be a response to China\u2019s increase in the value-added tax there.\nRelated stories\nA top insider just leaked the first solid details about Apple's 2020 iPhones\nApple's upcoming credit card is a lot cooler than you might think\nApple insider claims 2019 iPhones will have two-way wireless charging\nThe Apple cuts haven\u2019t just included iPhone sold in China. The company actually dropped prices on most of its key products \u2014 including iPads, Macs and AirPods as well as iPhones \u2014 sold via its official online store in China by almost 6%. In one example, the price of the base model iPhone XR was cut 4.6% from 6499RMB to 6199RMB (which is equivalent to a drop from $968.34 to $923.64). Likewise, CNBC reports that the prices of both the iPhone XS and XS Max were each cut 500RMB, which is equal to almost $75.\nFor some more context around why Apple would do that, consider that 15 percent of Apple\u2019s holiday quarter revenue was attributable to sales from China. During that quarter, though, Apple earned a little more than $13 billion in revenue from China, down almost $5 billion from the same quarter in 2017.\n\u201cIf you look at our results, our shortfall is over 100 percent from iPhone, and it\u2019s primarily in greater China,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC earlier this year just before the company reported its fourth quarter earnings.\nApple hasn\u2019t set a date yet for its next quarterly earnings report, but the assumption is that it will be in early May. It will come amid a subtle shit in emphasis for the company, for which hardware sales remain the biggest revenue-generator. Nevertheless, its top leaders are also keen to grow Apple\u2019s services revenue as hardware sales increasingly mature.\nApple is doing something in China it almost never does: Cutting iPhone prices See ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/2sWn6fZ", "https://bgr.com/2019/04/01/apple-cuts-prices-china-iphone/", "http://bit.ly/2RZO3hQ", "https://bgr.com/2019/04/01/apple-cuts-prices-china-iphone/&quot;", "https://bgr.com/2019/04/01/apple-card-credit-score-virtual-number/&quot;", "https://bgr.com/2019/04/01/iphone-11-two-way-wireless-charging-feature/&quot;", "https://bgr.com/2019/03/29/airpower-release-cancelled-overheating-problems/", "https://bgr.com/2019/03/29/airpower-release-cancelled-overheating-problems/&quot;", "https://pages.email.bgr.com/newsletters/?source=nypost", "https://bgr.com/2019/04/01/iphone-11-two-way-wireless-charging-feature/", "http://bit.ly/2UxKn3I", "http://bit.ly/2sWn6fZ&quot;", "https://bgr.com/2019/04/01/apple-card-credit-score-virtual-number/", "http://bit.ly/2UxKn3I&quot;", "https://pages.email.bgr.com/newsletters/?source=nypost&quot;", "http://bit.ly/2RZO3hQ&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T07:35:36.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c004ecb4aafe841fc18633b761b2336cb4a01b27", "url": "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190401005992/en/Sabra-Health-Care-REIT-Announces-Sale-28", "site_full": "www.businesswire.com", "site": "businesswire.com", "site_section": "https://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/", "site_categories": ["jewelry_making", "media", "hobbies_and_interests", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "Press release distribution, EDGAR filing, XBRL, regulatory filings | Business Wire", "title": "Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc.

Announces the Sale of 28 Facilities Previously Operated by Senior Care Centers and the Completion of the Holiday Portfolio Conversion", "text": "IRVINE, Calif.- Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc. (\u201cSabra,\u201d the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d) (Nasdaq: SBRA) today announced that the Company has completed the previously announced transactions described below.\nSale of Senior Care Centers Facilities\nOn April 1, 2019, we completed the sale of 28 facilities previously operated by Senior Care Centers, generating gross sales proceeds of $282.5 million, which we expect to use to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In addition, in connection with the closing of the sale of these facilities and pursuant to the previously announced settlement agreement we entered into with Senior Care Centers, we received $5 million of the $9.5 million of total settlement payments concurrently with such closing.\nSeven of the remaining 10 facilities operated by Senior Care Centers are expected to be leased to a current operator in the Sabra portfolio under a 12-year triple-net master lease effective on or about May 15, 2019, generating initial annual cash base rents of $5.7 million with provisions allowing Sabra opportunities to periodically reset base rent as the value of these properties increase during the subsequent period of stabilization. The remaining 3 facilities (2 of which are currently non-operational) are expected to be sold in the coming months and will generate no continuing rental revenues for the Company. These transactions, along with the previously announced settlement agreement, will end Sabra\u2019s relationship with Senior Care Centers.\nHoliday Conversion\nOn April 1, 2019, we completed the conversion of our 21-community Holiday portfolio (the \u201cHoliday Communities\u201d) from a triple-net master lease to a management agreement structure. In connection with the conversion, we terminated our Holiday master lease and concurrently entered into management agreements (the \u201cHoliday Management Agreements\u201d) pursuant to which Holiday will manage the Holiday Communities. In exchange for terminating the master lease, we received $57.2 million of total cash consideration, which we expect to use to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nAs previously disclosed, the management fee to be paid to Holiday pursuant to the Holiday Management Agreements will be equal to a monthly base fee in the amount of 5% of revenues (the \u201cBase Management Fee\u201d) during the first year of the term of the Holiday Management Agreements. After the first year, the management fee will be equal to the Base Management Fee plus an incentive fee based on the growth in EBITDAR after capital expenditures for the Holiday Communities above agreed upon performance thresholds. The Holiday Management Agreements have a one-year term with one-year extensions at Sabra\u2019s option.\nThe above transactions were contemplated in our 2019 earnings guidance issued on February 24, 2019. As a result of these transactions, our pro forma Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2018 (including our share of EBITDA and debt from the unconsolidated Enlivant joint venture) is reduced to 5.90x, compared to 6.12x as of December 31, 2018. In addition, these transactions reduce our concentration of annualized Cash NOI from Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care facilities in Texas from 11.0% to 5.7% and reduce our concentration of total beds/units in Texas from 18.0% to 14.8%.\nCommenting on these and other recent developments, Rick Matros, CEO and Chairman, said, \u201cWe are very pleased to turn the page on the final chapter of our Senior Care Centers relationship. While the level of challenges we faced with Senior Care Centers were not anticipated at the time of the Care Capital Properties merger, we are pleased to now have the major tenant repositionings behind us and to be able to capitalize in the future on the benefits that the CCP merger afforded Sabra, including:\nthe rating agency upgrades to investment grade status, resulting in immediate lowering of borrowing costs, doubling our operator base, thereby reducing our exposure to any one tenant to below 10%, and doubling our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, which afforded us the ability to enter into the Enlivant JV and make the related investments. It is also worth noting that we have successfully lowered our SNF concentration to 60%, which is within a couple of percentage points of where we were before the CCP merger; and despite the challenges, the CCP merger was ultimately accretive to normalized pro forma AFFO prior to the merger after taking into account the impact of Senior Care Centers lost revenues and all portfolio repositioning rent adjustments.\u201d\nAbout Sabra\nSabra Health Care REIT, Inc. (Nasdaq: SBRA), a Maryland corporation, operates as a self-administered, self-managed real estate investment trust (a \"REIT\") that, through its subsidiaries, owns and invests in real estate serving the healthcare industry. Sabra leases properties to tenants and operators throughout the United States and Canada.\nSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis release contains \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $71.14 million, up 66.13% from the year-ago period.\nAYX's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $0.40 per share and revenue of $349.38 million.

As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum.

Top-rated Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says in a note to investors that the Cupertino-based tech giant would use larger batteries on all three models debuting this year. Apple is expected to stick with the current three-model lineup that includes 5.8-inch, 6.1-inch, and 6.5-inch models, and while the design is likely to remain largely the same, more significant improvements are expected under the hood. The analyst says the iPhone XS, which currently features a 2,658 mAh battery, would come with a battery whose capacity would be increased by up to 25 percent. The iPhone XS Max itself will also get a massive upgrade of around 15 percent, while the iPhone XR, which runs on a 2,942 mAh battery, would receive the smallest increase of just 5 percent. Enter reverse wireless charging The reason for these massive upgrades, at least on the iPhone XS and the XS Max, is that Apple wants to add bilateral wireless charging. Already available on a series of Android devices, like the Samsung Galaxy S10, bilateral wireless charging allows a smartphone to wirelessly charge other devices using their own batteries. On the iPhone, Apple most likely wants to provide users with the added convenience of charging the Apple Watch or the AirPods on the go whenever a standard charger can\u2019t be used. By increasing the battery capacity, Apple tries to make sure that charging other devices wouldn\u2019t substantially impact the experience with the iPhone. Apple has already reached out to a series of partners for this iPhone upgrade, including Compeq, Unimicron, and TTM, all of which are supposed to help increase the battery capacity of the 2019 models and make bilateral wireless charging happen. For now, however, we\u2019re still far away from the moment the new iPhones would get the go-ahead, so anything could change overnight if something goes wrong. # Apple # iPhone # 2019 iPhone # reverse wireless charging hot right now", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bogdan popa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ming-chi kuo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T08:54:19.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b516a0c7a6d06952bbd47393bb5143810bc50fb3", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/news/3447219-amneal-sell-creo-pharma-unit", "site_full": "seekingalpha.com", "site": "seekingalpha.com", "site_section": "https://seekingalpha.com/market-news/m-a", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "mutual_funds"], "section_title": "M&amp;A News | Seeking Alpha", "title": "Amneal to sell Creo Pharma unit - Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

All those cables mean clutter, which is why a charging stand can help keep order.\nWhat's more, if you have an Apple Watch , you definitely have an iPhone. That means you have two devices that you need to charge every night. And that means you need two wall outlets and two different chargers. A big hassle, especially now that the AirPower is done for .\nRead on for our pick of the best Apple Watch charging stands, with many that provide a home for your Apple Watch, too. Nomad Base Station\nNomad makes some of the best premium-looking, minimalist accessories out there, and with the Base Station it's created a path that can charge your Apple Watch, AirPods and iPhone all at once.\nIt'll use a little side pad for the Apple Watch, while your AirPods and iPhone will get to sit on the charging pad, powered by three charging coils. This actually makes the Nomad Base Station the best charging pad for those mourning the lost of AirPower.\n$139.95, Amazon | hellonomad.com Anden Valet\nFew Apple Watch charging stands look as good as the Anden Valet, which offers four slots to hold your various Apple Watch straps, as well as place for your Apple Watch to charge.\nThe Valet comes made-to-order from the company's East London studio, in a choice of Walnut, Cherry and Rippled Maple, hand-finished with natural oils. It also features a precision-drilled slot for your existing Apple Watch charger.\n\u20ac100, madebyanden.com Belkin Valet Charge Dock\nThe gold standard of dual Apple product chargers, the Belkin Valet features an integrated Lightning cable and integrated Apple Watch wireless charger. That Apple Watch charger is also magnetic, just like the regular Apple Watch charger, so it'll just snap into place. On top of that, it's also an elegant looking stand that will look the part on your nightstand \u2013 especially as it comes in black, rose gold and silver.\n\u00a399.95, Amazon | belkin.com Belkin Powerhouse\nThat's right, Belkin has a slightly cheaper dual dock for you to consider too. This one is a better fit for those of us who love to rock cases. There's an adjustable dial hidden in the back that will move the Lighting charger forward and backward to make space for said case.\n\u00a389.99, Amazon | belkin.com Pad & Quill Timber Catchall\nPad & Quill is known for its high-quality wooden Apple Watch stands, but if you want something that throws in your iPhone the Timber Catchall is a beautiful option. It contains a nice little cutout for your iPhone, and it's big enough for your iPhone XS. The big drawback here is that you still do need two cables, but at least they'll be organised.\n$69.95, padandquill.com TwelveSouth HiRise Duet\nSure, stands that charge your iPhone and Apple Watch at the same time are handy, but they also take a good amount of space. If that's at a premium on your nightstand, TwelveSouth's HiRise Duet will save you a ton of it. It'll keep your iPhone up high, while charging your Apple Watch down near the bottom. TwelveSouth also claims that the HiRise Duet will charge your devices 15% faster than a regular old charger.\n$119.99, Amazon | twelvesouth.com Griffin WatchStand\nGriffin's WatchStand takes a bit of a different tack. It connects to a wall outlet, then has two USB ports underneath. You plug your Apple Watch and Lighting cables down under there, wrap them around and plug them into your iPhone and Apple Watch. It's a little more work than other stands, but it also comes with a nice soft spot for you to rest your iPhone on.\n$59.99, Amazon | griffintechnology.com Mercase Apple Watch and iPhone stand\nIf you're looking for something a little more affordable, Mercase's dual stand is a good option. It's not as advanced as the others here, and it merely puts your iPhone and Apple Watch in the same general space, but it works. Just to be clear, though: you will need two different cables here, as the Mercase is simply a stand.\n\u00a311.99, Amazon Evolus 3 Qi\nIf you've got an iPhone XS, you may have been tempted to use wireless charging. If you're looking for a stand that'll also charge your Apple Watch though, that might not be so easy. Well, until the Evolus 3 Qi. You'll be able to wirelessly charge your iPhone with up to 7.5 watts. There's also a spot for your Apple Watch and a bigger spot for something like an iPad. Or even a second iPhone if you need.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.belkin.com/uk/p/P-F8J200/", "https://hellonomad.com/products/base-station-apple-watch", "https://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-F8J183-APL/", "http://geni.us/sTY34dp", "https://www.madebyanden.co.uk/shop/watchvaletwood", "http://geni.us/aBJ5", "https://geni.us/Mh6XAe", "http://geni.us/BOUDIQv", "https://griffintechnology.com/products/power/charging-docks/watchstand-charging-station", "https://www.twelvesouth.com/product/hirise-duet", "https://twitter.com/hsumra", "https://www.padandquill.com/the-timber-catchall-for-apple-watch.html", "https://geni.us/x0G9NDF", "http://geni.us/AyFO"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T09:01:00.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "abbd426e23d76fe1f551f1bdea73f5ed9e9edd51", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/news/3447347-new-finance-chief-acadia-pharma", "site_full": "seekingalpha.com", "site": "seekingalpha.com", "site_section": "https://seekingalpha.com/market-news/healthcare", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "mutual_funds"], "section_title": "Healthcare News | Seeking Alpha", "title": "New finance chief at Acadia Pharma - ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.
