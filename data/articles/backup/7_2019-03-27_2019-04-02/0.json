The origins of the annual celebration can be traced back hundreds of years , yet many are still caught out on the day by believable hoaxes. In recent years, increasing numbers of brands have joined in the battle to fool as many people as possible. This year, companies including McDonald's , the British Transport Police and the BBC have joined in the fun by catching out gullible consumers with fabricated marketing campaigns. Here are some of the best April Fool's pranks so far this year: The McDonald's 'McPickle' burger For April Fool's Day, McDonald's Australia announced the launch of its new 'McPickle' burger on Instagram, made from \"juicy, flavoursome pickles layered between melted cheese, ketchup sauce and toasted sesame seed buns\". While the new addition to the fast food chain's menu may have seemed like an obvious April Fool's joke to some, others were still hopeful that it may turn out to be true. \"Omfg if this is [an] April Fool's joke imma be mad,\" one person commented on Instagram . \"I'm gonna order 1,000,\" a pickle aficionado remarked. However, the news was too good to be true, as McDonald's Australia later commented underneath the Instagram post, saying that the pickle burger was \"available until yesterday\". BBC iPlayer introduces 'Skip The Sex' option For their April Fool's Day gag, BBC iPlayer announced the addition of a new feature on the on-demand platform: the 'Skip The Sex' button. The BBC explained that the feature would be ideal for anyone who would rather avoid \"awkward sex scenes\" while watching television with the family or on public transport. \"Fornication with the family? Skip. Titillation on the train? Skip. Intercourse with the in-laws? Skip,\" the advert states. While the feature is evidently not going to actually be made available, some television watchers have said that they think it could actually be a good idea in future. \"I know this is an April Fool's but it would be a good feature,\" one person tweeted . \"Now if this were real I'd be able to watch Game of Thrones with my husband and son!\" another added . A ban on smelly food on trains Fed up of having to endure stinky sandwiches and smelly snacks on trains? As part of new anti-social behaviour legislation, those caught eating offensive food items while in transit could face a penalty fare of up to \u00a32,000. Check before you travel \ud83d\udc49 https://t.co/kePXd0M6Yz pic.twitter.com/Or9LRThRsw \u2014 British Transport Police (@BTP) April 1, 2019 There's nothing worse than sitting down on a train for your daily commute, only for the passenger sitting next to you to start tucking into smelly food. The British Transport Police agrees, which is why for April Fool's it's announced those that do so could face a \u00a32,000 fine. The police force stated that those \"caught eating offensive food items\" on public transport may face a penalty fare, as part of \"new anti-social behaviour legislation\". While the announcement was made in jest, several Twitter users said they'd almost been fooled. \"You know it's concerning when I'm actually having to wonder whether this is a joke or not,\" one person remarked . Cricketers to have Instagram handles on kits As part of our efforts to make the game more appealing to younger generations, the ICC will be applying both numbers and Instagram handles to kits from the beginning of the World Test Championship. pic.twitter.com/XnvantQfc9 \u2014 ICC (@ICC) April 1, 2019 While cricket is a popular game among sports fans of all ages, some may think of it as slightly more appealing to older generations. That's why the International Cricket Council (ICC) joked that players' kits will feature their Instagram handles on their kits from the beginning of the World Test Championship. \"In further changes ahead of the World Test Championship, the tradition of the coin toss will be replaced by a @Twitter poll, allowing fans at home to decide who bats and bowls!\" the organisation added. The ICC also said that when temperatures increase over summer, cricketers will be allowed to depart from cricket sartorial tradition by wearing shorts. \"I know it's a prank, but the idea of including social media handles is pretty good,\" one cricket fan remarked on Twitter. Story continues New Yorkshire Tea Spreadable! It's like normal tea, only thicker. pic.twitter.com/n2SahkFa4O \u2014 Yorkshire Tea (@YorkshireTea) April 1, 2019 The tea blend company made the announcement on Twitter, sharing a picture of the jar of the innovative spread with the tagline: \"Let's have a proper slice.\" Considering the recent launch of Marmite Peanut Butter , many could be forgiven for believing that Yorkshire Tea had created a spreadable tea but sadly, it was only an April Fool's. Nonetheless, some consumers expressed interest in the concept. \"I know the date but I would still buy this, lads,\" one person tweeted . \"I know this is a joke but hell I'd buy this perfect combo with a nice mug of Yorkshire tea strong,\" another commented . Sainsbury\u2019s launches limited edition pink avocados Sainsbury's announces launch of limited edition pink avocados for April Fool's Day (Sainsbury's) More For this year\u2019s April Fool\u2019s, Sainsbury\u2019s announced the launch of the pink avocado , describing it as the \u201cfirst-of-its-kind\u201d. Named the \u201cRosa-vo\u201d, the supermarket claims the rose-hued fruit could prove popular among foodie millennials. \u201cWhilst we know Sainsbury\u2019s customers are loyal devotees to the iconic brunch dish, we felt it was about time the humble avo-toast was given a bit of a refresh and social-specific makeover,\u201d a Sainsbury\u2019s spokesperson said. While the concept of the pink avocado has been fabricated, it does look like it could make an appealing addition to any brunch menu.

McDonald's has bought into NZX-listed technology company Plexure, which has had a global deal to provide the United States fast-food giant with mobile marketing technology since 2015. Operating in a supposedly red-hot sector of the technology industry and having what is arguably the world's best-known fast-food chain as a customer has not proved a bonanza for shareholders in the Auckland business. Plexure \u2013 formerly known as Vmob \u2013 has lost 80 per cent of its value since it first listed on the NZX's junior NZAX market in 2012 after winning \"best Hi-Tech start-up\" at the Hi-Tech Awards a year earlier. But McDonald's announcement that it would buy a 10 per cent stake in the firm for $5.4 million saw its shares jump by more than a third to a high of 44c on Tuesday morning. READ MORE: * Vmob sees loss and sales jump Plexure provides an app that McDonald's uses in 48 countries, including the US, to provide discount vouchers and loyalty offers to McDonald's customers. As part of a new, expanded partnership between the companies, Plexure will be prohibited from providing its service to some of McDonald's competitors in the fast food industry. McDonald's chief executive Steve Easterbrook said mobile apps were playing a key role for the business \"allowing customers to interact with us on their terms in a personal, customised way\". Plexure chief executive Craig Herbison, who has headed the company for 18 months and achieved something of a turn-around, said 110 million people around the world were using the apps Plexure provided. Its other customers include 7-Eleven, Ikea, and Loyalty New Zealand. Herbison said it remained a \"price-sensitive market\", but new usage-based pricing agreed with McDonald's was expected to bring in an extra $1m a year.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vmob", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mcdonald", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nzx-listed plexure mcdonald", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kiwi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "plexure", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nzx", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auckland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T02:12:13.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d661e82a73d36845f16d2580af13c7c1892cad03", "url": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=12218458", "site_full": "www.nzherald.co.nz", "site": "nzherald.co.nz", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/co/CIqI", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "New Zealand Herald - Top Stories", "title": "McDonald's gives Kiwi tech firm $5.4m vote of confidence", "title_full": "McDonald's gives Kiwi tech firm $5.4m vote of confidence", "published": "2019-04-02T01:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NZ", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/giyM9Vjn6wAUaB8pttDxjN2CyHY=/1200x0/smart/filters:quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-syd-prod-nzme.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NPZU6F6MGJB55MT5YVPLQFUN2Y.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 4187, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 216, "comments": 170, "shares": 1042}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 104}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d661e82a73d36845f16d2580af13c7c1892cad03", "url": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=12218458", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsfeeds@nzherald.co.nz", "published": "2019-04-02T01:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "McDonald's gives Kiwi tech firm $5.4m vote of confidence", "text": "McDonald's gives Kiwi tech firm Plexure $5.4m vote of confidence 2 Apr, 2019 10:15am Take-away giant McDonald's has bought into Kiwi tech company Plexure. Photo/Getty Images. NZ Herald Share on Reddit reddit Fast-food multi-national McDonald's is spending $5.4 million on a 9.9 per cent stake in NZX-listed tech firm Plexure. McDonald's says this is its first-ever investment in a mobile app vendor and follows its recent announcement that it is buying Dynamic Yield, a decision-engine and personalisation company based in Israel and New York. McDonald's says its investment in Plexure will provide it with enhanced access to Plexure's technology in the quick-service restaurant space, including access to greater back-end and front-end features, customer functionality and customer targeting. \"Across all markets, we're using technology to elevate and transform the McDonald's customer experience,\" says group president and chief executive Steve Easterbrook. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. \"Our mobile apps play a key role in our digital acceleration, allowing customers to interact with us on their terms in a personal, customised way,\" Easterbrook says in a statement. \"This investment is a testament to our belief in Plexure's ability to deliver strong results for our business as well as the talent and technology they've cultivated.\" Plexure designs and builds software allowing other businesses, mainly retailers and fast food outlets, to target customers via their mobile phones. Plexure chief executive Craig Herbison says the funds from the placement of 13.8 million shares to McDonald's will be used to expand his company. The shares have been issued at 39.05 cents per share compared with Plexure's closing price yesterday at 31 cents, when its market capitalisation was $38.9 million. The shares lifted to 41 cents in early morning trading. Related articles: Plexure listed on NZX in 2012 as Vmob via a backdoor listing that included issuing shares at 2.5 cents each. It changed its name to Plexure in 2016. Plexure's success has caught the attention of a global giant. Photo/Supplied. Share on Reddit reddit \"This is a tremendous vote of confidence from our largest customer. This investment will further our efforts to reach more people with our technology, provide world-class service to our clients and execute our growth plans for our company,\" Herbison says. Herbison described the deal as one of \"limited exclusivity\", explaining that there is a list of brands that Plexure will no longer work with. \"Understandably, they will be their direct competitors, like Yum Foods, Restaurant brands and Burger King,\" Herbison tells the Herald . \"Outside of that, we still have full ability to sell our technology to other food brands, including those in the fast-casual space.\" He says Plexure has also had to \"stop deal flow with a few prospects\" keen to work with Plexure. While he wouldn't mention any names of these companies, he confirmed that they were in the quick-serve restaurant category. \"It's a compliment in a way in that they see our tech as so good that they don't want anyone else working with it,\" says Herbison when commenting on the halo effect of a global giant taking notice of Kiwi player. Herbison adds the company is also eyeing a number of other categories as it looks to expand the business in the coming years. \"We're in fuel and convenience with Seven-Eleven, we're in big box retail with Ikea, we're looking at global grocers and global hotel chains. We're really looking for businesses who want that global scale.\" Last month, Plexure said it expected revenue for the year ended March is likely to exceed $16.8 million, up more than 40 per cent on the previous year. However rising costs mean annual profit is likely to be about $1 million, little changed from the first half, excluding the impact of a maturing convertible note issue. Plexure boss Craig Herbison.

The figure was 18% in February.\nMs McDonald said: \"In respect of St Patrick's Day, I think it starts certainly a conversation around that banner which has been up and down Fifth Avenue for a generation.\n\"It's a very direct political statement, it's an anti-partition statement.\n\"I know it was taken by some to be directed at English people.

Macdonald: My version of Princess Margaret more fun than in The Crown By Emma Bowden, Press Association Reblog Kelly Macdonald has said her portrayal of Princess Margaret is more fun than in Netflix\u2019s The Crown. The actress plays the royal in the third series of Sky Arts\u2019 comedy Urban Myths, which tell fabled tales from the world of entertainment. The episode is set to explore Princess Margaret\u2019s relationship with veteran rock star Sir Mick Jagger, played by Twilight actor Jamie Campbell Bower. Vanessa Kirby played the Queen\u2019s sister in series one and two of The Crown, with Helena Bonham Carter taking over the role in the regal drama\u2019s third season. Helena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret in the upcoming series (Sophie Mutevelian/Netflix) More Macdonald told the Radio Times magazine: \u201cI got prosthetics and everything! \u201cLots of smoking and swearing and being drunk. And burping. \u201cOur version of her life is very fun. It\u2019s not The Crown.\u201d The Trainspotting actress next appears in new BBC legal thriller The Victim, alongside John Hannah and James Harkness. The four-part drama sees Macdonald play Anna Dean, whose nine-year-old son was murdered 15 years ago. Craig Myers, played by Harkness, is the victim of an attack after he is accused of killing the child, but says he is innocent. The show explores the mystery of whether he is the victim of mistaken identity, or the dangerous killer that Macdonald\u2019s character believes he is. Macdonald said of her character: \u201cI liked the fact that she\u2019s not wholly likeable. You think your sympathies should lie with her, but then she does things where you\u2019re not necessarily behind her actions. \u201cShe\u2019s a woman on the verge of madness. It\u2019s very psychological.\u201d Radio Times is out on Tuesday.

The details trigger thoughts of hoarding and maybe selling the house and moving to higher ground. To a millennial, the findings should inspire naked fear. Among other things, the report , which is scheduled to be released Tuesday, says:\nCanada's climate has been warming at roughly twice the rate of the rest of the world. In Northern Canada, it's even higher.\nAnd, says the report, there is simply no doubt about the cause. Climate change-skeptic conservatives will, of course, disagree, but here is what the scientists say:\n\"Canada's climate has warmed and will warm further in the future, driven by human influence. Both past and future warming in Canada is, on average, about double the magnitude of global warming.\"\nOur climate is not warming consistently. It is most pronounced in the Prairies and British Columbia, and especially severe in northern B.C. The effects are strongest in winter.\nIt is effectively irreversible. The antidote prescribed in the report is politically impossible, at least right now: \"Scenarios with limited warming will only occur if Canada and the rest of the world reduce carbon emissions to near zero early in the second half of the century.\"\nThe scientists predict an eventual increase in \"annual average country-wide temperature\" of about two degrees Celsius, a rate that will remain steady after mid-century. They say the increase could be as severe as six degrees.\nJason Franson/Canadian Press More The oceans around Canada have become more acidic and less oxygenated. Future warming will be heaviest in ice-free waters of the Canadian arctic. Most Canadians can expect coastal flooding to increase during their lifetimes.\nWarming of the oceans, in particular, is a truly vicious circle. According to the report:\n\"Ocean warming and loss of oxygen will intensify with further emissions of all greenhouse gases, whereas ocean acidification will increase in response to additional carbon dioxide emissions. These changes threaten the health of marine ecosystems.\"\nIn other words, worse begets even worse, begets disaster.\nCanada is experiencing hotter extreme heat and less cold extreme cold. Permafrost is warming. There is less ice and snow.\nRainfall is increasing, although less so in the summer months. As warming continues, Canada (of all places) will likely face freshwater shortages.\nThose are just the highlights. The main takeaway: if climate change worldwide is much more frightening and immediate than we all thought, as the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported six months ago, it's at least twice as bad in Canada.\nTwice. As. Bad.\nTo the Trudeau government, this is core-mission stuff. Last week, scientists from the environment department were brought in to the Prime Minister's Office for briefings. The report will be public and online Tuesday, and Justin Trudeau and members of his cabinet will be pushing the issue as something bordering on a national emergency, which is not an unreasonable way to characterize it.\nNormally, you'd think findings like these would penetrate deep into voters' minds. Climate change, with reports like this one and that of the IPCC last October, is becoming an issue of economic self-interest.\nSNC-Lavalin scandal\nBut these are not normal times. The Opposition is determined to keep public attention riveted on the SNC-Lavalin scandal , and former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould's remarkably effective effort to take down the prime minister.\nThat's not to say the new report won't generate headlines, but they will not be as politically explosive as, say, Wilson-Raybould's secretly recorded conversation with Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, which she submitted to the Commons justice committee last week. Over the weekend, at a ceremony in her honour in British Columbia, Wilson-Raybould signalled her determination to keep the story alive, and to continue speaking \"her truth.\" Tory leader Andrew Scheer is equally determined to assist her.\nProbably not coincidentally, the report is also landing at exactly the same time as a new carbon tax (the government wants to call it \"a price on pollution\") lands in Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick, increasing the price of fuel by about four cents a litre at the pump.\nStory continues Those four provinces had refused to levy their own carbon pricing plans, as other provinces have done, so the federal government stepped in with one of its own.\nNick Murray/CBC More Carbon tax was going to be a, if not the, big issue in the election campaign this fall. The new climate change report should be a considerable weapon to counter the attack on the carbon tax planned by Scheer and conservative provincial premiers.\nBut SNC-Lavalin has, for the last several weeks, shown itself capable of burning up all the political oxygen in Ottawa.\nAlmost certainly, Scheer and his allies will shrug at the findings of the report, and get right back to hammering on the unspeakable treatment of Wilson-Raybould and corruption, corruption, corruption. (No law was broken, no money changed hands, and Wilson-Raybould had the last say and her decision was not overruled, but still, corruption, corruption, end of democracy, etc.)\nAnd out on social media, the millions of Canadians who loathe Trudeau and everything he stands for will ridicule any reporter or news organization that tries to focus on our changing climate. To many conservatives, climate change is just a distraction, if not a hoax \u2013 something to be discussed later. Much later.\nIn fact, a lot of Canadians will regard this entire climate report as a shoddy diversion, and reporters who report it as \"tools of the PMO.\"\nOne other thing: people in government tell me the expulsion of Wilson-Raybould and former Treasury Board president Jane Philpott from the Liberal caucus is being accelerated. The plan was to do it on Wednesday, when the national Liberal caucus meets, but that's the day when 338 prospective female parliamentarians will be visiting Parliament Hill as part of the \"Daughters of the Vote\" push to encourage more women to enter politics \u2013 not an auspicious moment to expel two women, one of whom is now Canada's best known Indigenous figure.\nSo there are now plans for a series of emergency regional caucuses tonight and on Tuesday. One caucus organizer says the Quebec Liberal caucus unanimously supports expulsion, as well as 90 per cent of the Ontario caucus, 80 per cent of the Atlantic caucus, and 85-90 per cent of the Prairie caucus.\nB.C. Liberals are less certain about the issue, given the politics in that province, but the organizer says the recommendations from regional caucuses will be overwhelming. And Trudeau, who has publicly said he welcomes Wilson-Raybould's and Philpott's desire to run as Liberals in the next election, has indicated he will nonetheless announce his \"respect for the will of members\" and order the two MPs booted.\nThen he wants to start talking about the climate change report.

Plexure has played an important role in McDonald\u2019s focus on digital transformation, powering a version of McDonald\u2019s Global Mobile App in 48 countries outside the U.S. and other markets, including Italy and Japan. The transaction marks McDonald\u2019s first-ever investment in a mobile app vendor and follows its recent announcement to acquire Dynamic Yield, a decision-engine and personalization company based in Tel Aviv, Israel, and New York.\nFunds from the investment will further Plexure\u2019s growth plans while giving McDonald\u2019s enhanced access to Plexure\u2019s technology in the quick service restaurant (QSR) space, including access to greater back-end and front-end features, customer functionality and customer targeting, among others.\nThe investment coincides with an amendment to the existing software service agreement between the two companies, which will extend McDonald\u2019s usage of Plexure\u2019s technology and set new specifications for service levels and pricing. As part of this agreement, Plexure will not provide similar services to a defined list of competitors in the QSR space, based on certain terms and conditions.\n\u201cAcross all of our markets, we\u2019re using technology to elevate and transform the McDonald\u2019s customer experience,\u201d said Steve Easterbrook, President and Chief Executive Officer of McDonald\u2019s. \u201cOur mobile apps play a key role in our digital acceleration, allowing customers to interact with us on their terms in a personal, customized way. This investment is a testament to our belief in Plexure\u2019s ability to deliver strong results for our business as well as the talent and technology they\u2019ve cultivated.\u201d\nAdded Craig Herbison, Chief Executive Officer of Plexure, \u201cThis is a tremendous vote of confidence from our largest customer. This investment will further our efforts to reach more people with our technology, provide world-class service to our clients and execute our growth plans for our company.\u201d\nThe investment is being facilitated through the issuance of new equity in Plexure. Under the terms of the subscription agreement, McDonald\u2019s, through an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, will purchase 13,795,311 shares of Plexure, facilitated through a cash transaction at an issue price of NZ$0.3905, representing a 15% premium over the volume-weighted average price of Plexure shares during March 2019. The cash investment from McDonald\u2019s will result in a 9.9% minority stake, of which funds will be used for Plexure\u2019s growth and expansion purposes.\nAbout McDonald\u2019s\nMcDonald\u2019s is the world\u2019s leading global foodservice retailer with nearly 38,000 locations in over 100 countries around the world.

The origins of the annual celebration can be traced back hundreds of years , yet many are still caught out on the day by believable hoaxes. In recent years, increasing numbers of brands have joined in the battle to fool as many people as possible. This year, companies including McDonald's , the British Transport Police and the BBC have joined in the fun by catching out gullible consumers with fabricated marketing campaigns. Here are some of the best April Fool's pranks so far this year: The McDonald's 'McPickle' burger For April Fool's Day, McDonald's Australia announced the launch of its new 'McPickle' burger on Instagram, made from \"juicy, flavoursome pickles layered between melted cheese, ketchup sauce and toasted sesame seed buns\". While the new addition to the fast food chain's menu may have seemed like an obvious April Fool's joke to some, others were still hopeful that it may turn out to be true. \"Omfg if this is [an] April Fool's joke imma be mad,\" one person commented on Instagram . \"I'm gonna order 1,000,\" a pickle aficionado remarked. However, the news was too good to be true, as McDonald's Australia later commented underneath the Instagram post, saying that the pickle burger was \"available until yesterday\". BBC iPlayer introduces 'Skip The Sex' option For their April Fool's Day gag, BBC iPlayer announced the addition of a new feature on the on-demand platform: the 'Skip The Sex' button. The BBC explained that the feature would be ideal for anyone who would rather avoid \"awkward sex scenes\" while watching television with the family or on public transport. \"Fornication with the family? Skip. Titillation on the train? Skip. Intercourse with the in-laws? Skip,\" the advert states. While the feature is evidently not going to actually be made available, some television watchers have said that they think it could actually be a good idea in future. \"I know this is an April Fool's but it would be a good feature,\" one person tweeted . \"Now if this were real I'd be able to watch Game of Thrones with my husband and son!\" another added . A ban on smelly food on trains Fed up of having to endure stinky sandwiches and smelly snacks on trains? As part of new anti-social behaviour legislation, those caught eating offensive food items while in transit could face a penalty fare of up to \u00a32,000. Check before you travel \ud83d\udc49 https://t.co/kePXd0M6Yz pic.twitter.com/Or9LRThRsw \u2014 British Transport Police (@BTP) April 1, 2019 There's nothing worse than sitting down on a train for your daily commute, only for the passenger sitting next to you to start tucking into smelly food. The British Transport Police agrees, which is why for April Fool's it's announced those that do so could face a \u00a32,000 fine. The police force stated that those \"caught eating offensive food items\" on public transport may face a penalty fare, as part of \"new anti-social behaviour legislation\". While the announcement was made in jest, several Twitter users said they'd almost been fooled. \"You know it's concerning when I'm actually having to wonder whether this is a joke or not,\" one person remarked . Cricketers to have Instagram handles on kits As part of our efforts to make the game more appealing to younger generations, the ICC will be applying both numbers and Instagram handles to kits from the beginning of the World Test Championship. pic.twitter.com/XnvantQfc9 \u2014 ICC (@ICC) April 1, 2019 While cricket is a popular game among sports fans of all ages, some may think of it as slightly more appealing to older generations. That's why the International Cricket Council (ICC) joked that players' kits will feature their Instagram handles on their kits from the beginning of the World Test Championship. \"In further changes ahead of the World Test Championship, the tradition of the coin toss will be replaced by a @Twitter poll, allowing fans at home to decide who bats and bowls!\" the organisation added. The ICC also said that when temperatures increase over summer, cricketers will be allowed to depart from cricket sartorial tradition by wearing shorts. \"I know it's a prank, but the idea of including social media handles is pretty good,\" one cricket fan remarked on Twitter. Spreadable Yorkshire Tea New Yorkshire Tea Spreadable! It's like normal tea, only thicker. pic.twitter.com/n2SahkFa4O \u2014 Yorkshire Tea (@YorkshireTea) April 1, 2019 The tea blend company made the announcement on Twitter, sharing a picture of the jar of the innovative spread with the tagline: \"Let's have a proper slice.\" Considering the recent launch of Marmite Peanut Butter , many could be forgiven for believing that Yorkshire Tea had created a spreadable tea but sadly, it was only an April Fool's. Nonetheless, some consumers expressed interest in the concept. \"I know the date but I would still buy this, lads,\" one person tweeted . \"I know this is a joke but hell I'd buy this perfect combo with a nice mug of Yorkshire tea strong,\" another commented . Sainsbury\u2019s launches limited edition pink avocados Sainsbury's announces launch of limited edition pink avocados for April Fool's Day (Sainsbury's) More For this year\u2019s April Fool\u2019s, Sainsbury\u2019s announced the launch of the pink avocado , describing it as the \u201cfirst-of-its-kind\u201d. Named the \u201cRosa-vo\u201d, the supermarket claims the rose-hued fruit could prove popular among foodie millennials. \u201cWhilst we know Sainsbury\u2019s customers are loyal devotees to the iconic brunch dish, we felt it was about time the humble avo-toast was given a bit of a refresh and social-specific makeover,\u201d a Sainsbury\u2019s spokesperson said.

That's honestly not how I feel.\u201d\nHe's referring to posts he made on Facebook about MacDonald, among them: \u201cThat's the face of our island. It needs to stop,\u201d and \u201cLegit, someone murder me if I ever \u2026 represent Cape Breton like this.\u201d\nThe typically easy-going Frankie MacDonald did not respond in kind.\n\u201cHe has nothing better to do,\u201d MacDonald said.\nMacDonald says he was leaving a hockey game Sunday night when he checked social media and saw Boudreau's comments.\n\u201cI ignored them,\u201d he said. \u201cI ignore all negative comments.\u201d\nSocial media had plenty of those Monday as hundreds of people came to MacDonald's defence.\nAnother Sydney-area DJ who used to employ Boudreau says he's been contacted by people thinking he -- or his business -- had something to do with the comments.\n\u201cYou read it, and you're like, \u2018No, he's not. He's not really saying this,\u2019\u201d said Blaise Hollohan. \u201cI had to read it four or five times to really get a feeling for it, to believe that he actually came across Facebook and said it.\u201d\nAs it turns out, MacDonald and Boudreau know each other. Both remember meeting at some of the DJ's shows.\n\u201cI have an alcohol problem,\u201d Boudreau said. \u201cAnd I'm going to be doing what I can this week, as soon as possible, to get the help I need for that.\u201d\nBut Boudreau says he's not making any excuses. All he can do for now is ask forgiveness.\n\u201cFrankie's probably going to see this,\u201d Boudreau said. \u201cSo, Frankie, I am honestly and truly sorry man. I didn't mean any of that. You\u2019re a great guy and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.\u201d\nMacDonald accepted Boudreau\u2019s apology and says there are no hard feelings.\n\u201cHe's a great guy,\u201d he said. \u201cI met him before. He got his picture taken with me in 2013.\u201d\nPeople who know MacDonald are not surprised to hear that.\nIn the wake of all this, a night of support has been organized for MacDonald at a downtown Sydney bar where he's been known to hang out.\nBoudreau says, while he doesn't think it would be wise to show up, he thinks it's a great idea.\nWith files from CTV Atlantic\u2019s Ryan MacDonald.

But we kinda wish some of these prank foods were real. @McDonaldsUK/Twitter/Red Lobster/Facebook Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter SUBSCRIBE April 1, 2019, 2:53 PM GMT / Source: TODAY By Erica Chayes Wida Several big food chains are offering some pretty peculiar deals on April 1. Of course, it's April Fools' Day and folks across the country (and the world) are plotting out how to prank their pals and loved ones today. Popular food brands have also been scheming up some new ideas. While we'd actually love to chow down on a McPickle, it turns out that there are a lot of fakers out there. Here are some of the top food pranks TODAY Food has spotted on April Fools' Day 2019. Starbucks just for dogs \u2014 Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) April 1, 2019 Oh, how we wish Pupbucks was a real thing! Starbucks' adorable commercial featuring a bunch of furry extras certainly brings out the \"aww!\" factor. Of course, many Starbucks stores do already offer Puppuccinos (basically just whipped cream in a small cup) so a store catering entirely to man's best friend isn't totally off base. Red Lobster's Red Licorice Straws Red Lobster is no stranger to mixing things up in the kitchen. They once ran a special that offered fried lobster drizzled in syrup with a Belgian waffle \u2014 and no, that was not a prank. But on Monday, the chain rolled out a surprising \"promotion\" for an eco-friendly straw option. Starting Summer 2019, red licorice straws will be our 1st test for an eco-friendly alternative for plastic straws! Soon, you may even be able to enjoy that drink with a Cheddar Bay Biscuit flavored licorice straw. What do you think about this sweet move? #LicoriceStraw pic.twitter.com/N7AUX8DhjQ \u2014 Red Lobster (@redlobster) April 1, 2019 \"Starting Summer 2019, red licorice straws will be our 1st test for an eco-friendly alternative for plastic straws!\" the chain wrote on its social media pages. Some licorice haters were disappointed. But others were excited. \"Might be good in some of the alcoholic drinks,\" an inventive fan wrote. Sipping cola through Red Vines isn't that unusual so even if the chain doesn't offer these edible straws soon, customers could just bring their own. McDonald's milkshake sauce pots McDonald's latest spring special involves one delightfully delicious habit many diners claim to love: dipping the chain's signature salty fries into their sweet shakes. Which country eats the most French fries? (Hint: It's not us) July 13, 2016 00:53 To make fry dipping that much easier, the chain \"introduced\" its first milkshake dipping sauces in four different flavors: vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and Shamrock (in the U.K., the chain joked about offering up a banana dipping sauce). \u2014 McDonald's UK (@McDonaldsUK) March 31, 2019 Most of the chain's followers weren't duped by the funny video. However, that hasn't stopped them from begging the chain to make milkshake sauce pots a real thing. I know this is April Fools but that's actually genius. Please make this real! \u2014 Kaleb01 (@Kaleb01_) April 1, 2019 Hasbro's Mr. Avo Head Hasbro , known for its iconic games and toys like Monopoly, Transformers and My Little Pony, created a new toy for all of the hipster children in the world. And he looks really delicious. Holy guacamole! We\u2019ve given Mr. Potato Head the sack and we're introducing his new hipster companion, Mr Avo Head! pic.twitter.com/Y9aRITCTd7 \u2014 Hasbro (@Hasbro) April 1, 2019 \"Holy guacamole!\" Hasbro's social media peeps exclaimed on Twitter. \"We\u2019ve given Mr. Potato Head the sack and we're introducing his new hipster companion, Mr. Avo Head! Avocado stuffed toys already exist, so this really isn't too much of a stretch, either \u2014 even if it isn't real. I bet his favorite music is Guac & Roll \ud83c\udfb5! \u2014 Shawn Warford (@Shawnforward13) April 1, 2019 Hardee's Chief Biscuit Officer For anyone obsessed with biscuits ( South Carolina native Craig Melvin is obviously a huge fan ), the fast food chain Hardee's is offering up the opportunity of a lifetime. The chain is \"hiring\" a chief biscuit officer \u2014 that's CBO to you. The position will reportedly handle and carefully approve all biscuit business. Join the Hardee\u2019s family! We\u2019re hiring for a Chief Biscuit Officer to oversee anything and everything biscuits at Hardee\u2019s. Please apply at: https://t.co/9rSQ8uS4WP pic.twitter.com/kh4Jx8Fn7k \u2014 Hardee's (@Hardees) April 1, 2019 While this very sadly isn't a real position at the company, there really is an application page on the website. A Hardee's spokesperson told TODAY that applying to the position will enter biscuit fiends into the running for a year's worth of free biscuits (and that part's no joke!). McDonald's beautiful McPickle special McDonald's Australia thought it would be funny to launch an April Fools' Day burger for pickle fans. They didn't realize, however, just how many pickle there are in the world and people were very, very upset when they realized they'd been deceived by the chain.

At one point, another girl, also reportedly 17, climbs onto the counter and begins pepper spraying a security guard and other employees in the face, before seeming to slip off the platform.\nTony Algarin, the security guard at the scene, told Breaking AC that this was his second day assigned to that McDonald\u2019s location.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been maced before,\u201d said Algarin, 28. \u201cIt sucked and it burned but I knew I had to finish my job.\u201d\nThe group continued to cause damage to the story by throwing napkins and knocking over other items before fleeing the scene.\nThe owner of the restaurant, Anthony Mack told the New York Post four or five employees had been hit with pepper spray, but employees refused medical treatment at the time.\nFour people were arrested, including three 17-year-old girls and 21-year-old Marcus Adderly, police said. Those involved are being charged with criminal mischief and disorderly conduct.
