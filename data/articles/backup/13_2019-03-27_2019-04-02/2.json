Friday Saturday\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The number of U.S. measles cases through the first three months of this year have surpassed the count for all of 2018, health officials say.\nThere have been 387 cases through March, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Monday. There were 372 last year.\nThe numbers are preliminary, and may change. But the 2019 tally is already the most since 2014, when 667 were reported.\nThis year\u2019s numbers have been driven by outbreaks in several states, including New York, California, Illinois, Texas, and Washington.\nMost people who get measles have not been vaccinated. In the U.S., most outbreaks are sparked by travelers who picked up the virus in countries where measles is more common. Nearly 83,000 people contracted measles in Europe in 2018, the highest number in a decade, according to the World Health Organization.\nThe measles vaccine is 97% effective, according to the CDC.\nMeasles is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and it is extremely contagious.\nFor most people, measles is miserable but not life-threatening. The most common symptoms include fever, runny nose, cough, and a rash all over the body. However, a very small fraction of people get much sicker, and can suffer complications like pneumonia and swelling of the brain. Also, measles can cause pregnant women to deliver prematurely.\nThere have been three measles-related deaths reported in the U.S. since 2000, including two in 2003 and one in 2015.

A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does the Plan Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with \u2018yield' or \u2018income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Plan Fund's net asset value per share.\nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates and are not provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon each PlanFund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Each Plan Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\nFund Performance and Distribution Rate Information: Fund Average annual total\nreturn (in relation to\nNAV) for the 5-year\nperiod ending on\n1/31/2019\nAnnualized current\ndistribution rate\nexpressed as a\npercentage of NAV as\nof 1/31/2019\nCumulative total return\n(in relation to NAV) for\nthe fiscal year through\n1/31/2019\nCumulative fiscal\nyear distributions\nas a percentage\nof NAV as of\n1/31/2019\nBCX 1.12% 6.80% 9.47% 0.57% BDJ 8.10% 6.05% 6.42% 0.50% BGR (4.76)% 7.04% 10.31% 0.59% BGY 0.45% 6.69% 4.27% 0.56% BME 12.00% 6.33% 5.83% 0.53% BOE 3.12% 6.52% 4.61% 0.54% BUI 6.68% 7.34% 5.92% 0.61% CII 9.34% 6.06% 6.72% 0.50% BST* 17.43% 6.08% 11.66% 0.51% EGF 1.86% 3.63% 0.82% 0.30% *Portfolio launched within the past 5 years; the performance and distribution rate information presented for this Fund reflects data from inception to 1/31/2019.\nShareholders should not draw any conclusions about a Plan Fund's investment performance from the amount of the Plan Fund's current distributions or from the terms of a Plan Fund's Plan.\nBKT has adopted a Plan whereby beginning August 2018 the Fund will make fixed monthly distributions to common stockholders and will distribute all available investment income to its stockholders, consistent with its investment objective and as required by the Code. The fixed amount distributed per share is subject to change at the discretion of BKT's Board. If sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return capital to its stockholders in order to maintain a level distribution. The Fund is currently not relying on any exemptive relief from Section 19(b) of the 1940 Act. The Fund expects that distributions under the Plan will exceed current income and capital gains and therefore will likely include a return of capital. BKT may make additional distributions from time to time, including additional capital gain distributions at the end of the taxable year, if required to meet requirements imposed by the Code and/or the 1940 Act.\nBKT's estimated sources of the distributions paid as of February 28, 2019 and for its current fiscal year is as follows:\nEstimated Allocations as of February 28, 2019 Fund Distribution Net Investment\nIncome\nNet Realized\nShort-Term Gains\nNet Realized\nLong-Term Gains\nReturn of Capital BKT $0.034400 $0.034400 (100%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) Estimated Allocations for the Fiscal Year through February 28, 2019 Fund Distribution Net Investment\nIncome\nNet Realized\nShort-Term Gains\nNet Realized\nLong-Term Gains\nReturn of Capital BKT $0.034400 $0.034400 (100%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) The amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates and are being provided to you pursuant to regulatory requirements and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes.

The Board may amend the terms of a Plan or suspend or terminate a Plan at any time without prior notice to the Fund's shareholders if it deems such actions to be in the best interest of the Fund or its shareholders.

Justice The Chief Justice, Madam Sophia Akuffo, has stressed the need to strengthen the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms in the country\u2019s judicial process to expedite dispute resolution, as a tool to enhance justice delivery. She said it was important for court registrars and judicial officers to identify and document challenges that tend to cripple ADR processes in the respective courts and seek timely support from the appropriate quarters, to ensure its smooth implementation. Addressing judicial officers of the Nkawie Circuit Court, she said effective ADR implementation, could speed up dispute resolution and thus reduce the pressure on the courts. Madam Akuffo was at Nkawie as part of her working visit to the Ashanti Region. The Chief Justice also visited the Nyinahin Magistrate Court in the Atwima-Mponua District, Twedie Magistrate Court in the Atwima-Kwanwoma and the Akropong Magistrate Court in the Nwabiagya South District. She appealed to the district assemblies to help provide appropriate infrastructure to help promote quality justice delivery, especially at the local levels for all. Mr Michael Amoah Awuku, Atwima-Nwabiagya Municipal Chief Executive, said the Assembly was committed to provide the courts with the needed facilities to enable it perform its core duties of the dispensation of justice. He called on judicial officers to avoid negative acts that could undermine justice delivery, whiles working diligently to improve the peaceful resolution of the cases that were brought to the courts. Mr Michael Johnson Abbey, the Presiding Judge of the Nkawie Circuit Court, pledged the commitment of staff to work to provide quality justice delivery to the people.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sophia akuffo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "madam sophia akuffo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nkawie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madam akuffo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "akropong magistrate court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twedie magistrate court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nkawie circuit court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyinahin magistrate court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "nwabiagya south district", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atwima-mponua district", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T03:02:03.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "10bd685d99ed28d3fbaaa83a77ed4b9d91cad2c9", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47781243", "site_full": "www.bbc.co.uk", "site": "bbc.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.japaninc.com/aggregator/rss/1", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "www.japaninc.com aggregator", "title": "BBC World News: Pete Buttigieg: US mayor marries couple just before C-section", "title_full": "BBC World News: Pete Buttigieg: US mayor marries couple just before C-section", "published": "2019-04-02T01:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/20EA/production/_106262480_capture.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 108, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "10bd685d99ed28d3fbaaa83a77ed4b9d91cad2c9", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47781243", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T01:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "BBC World News: Pete Buttigieg: US mayor marries couple just before C-section", "text": "Image copyright Facebook/Pete Buttigieg Image caption Mayor Pete Buttigieg (centre) married Mary and Gabe in his office A US mayor and presidential hopeful held a last-minute wedding for a couple just before the woman headed to hospital for a Caesarean-section.\nPete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said the pair, Mary and Gabe, caught him arriving at his office at about 08:15 and asked to be wed before the baby was delivered.\nStaff acted as witnesses and they used ribbons as their rings were not ready.\nMary then made her 09:00 appointment and gave birth to a baby girl.\nJade Katherine Jones has become South Bend's \"newest resident\", Mayor Buttigieg wrote in a post on his Facebook page.\n\"It's moments like this that I'll miss when my term as mayor comes to an end,\" he wrote, publishing a picture of the baby girl.\nImage copyright Facebook/Pete Buttigieg Image caption \"Welcome, Jade, to this unlikely and lovely world!\" Mayor Buttigieg said \"Congratulations to the newlyweds and new parents, and welcome, Jade, to this unlikely and lovely world!\"\nIn January, Mayor Buttigieg, 37, threw his hat into the ring for the 2020 US presidential election, joining the battle for the Democratic Party's nomination -

It has contributed to the ongoing opioid epidemic in America that led to 18,000 deaths last year, he noted.\nThe People's Republic of China on Monday followed through on a pledge , though short of immediacy, it made in December to list the drug as a controlled substance. The new rule goes into effect May 1st.\nCramer said he doesn't see this as a win for President Donald Trump, who has called on his counterpart to hold fentanyl \"distributors and pushers\" accountable by death penalty. The Chinese, however, have blamed the U.S. for its abuse.\n\"There was no serious push by the Communist Party [of China] to put a stop to this. Every time China's banned one kind of fentanyl, their manufacturers just change the formula a little bit to something that's now legal,\" Cramer said. \"This new ban is supposed to change all of that, but given China's track record when it comes to upholding international agreements, consider me skeptical.\"\nGet Cramer's full insight here\nHello, Q2 A woman fuels her SUV at an Exxon Mobile gas station in Chicago. More Cramer said investors can get an idea of how the market could perform in the second quarter by understanding how the major averages rallied during the first quarter of the year.\nThe Nasdaq had the biggest gain \u2014 16 percent \u2014 to open the year. The S&P 500 rallied 13.1 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 11 percent in the first quarter. The indexes all added more or less 1.2 percent during Monday's session.\n\"I think the stock market benefited from a dearth of new supply\" due to the government shutdown, its impact on IPOs and the high-volume of company stock buyback programs, the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"I think this market can go higher as long as we don't get overwhelmed with new supply from this wave of IPOs, because I think the valuations are still too low for so many stocks, like we see from the top five performers in the Dow.\"\nIt was a \"fabulous windfall for investors\" until Friday, Cramer said, when Lyft went public at $72 a share and traded as high as $88. The share price fell to nearly $69 at Monday's close.\nCramer took a look at the Dow's highest-performing stocks in the first quarter to predict the future.\nRead more here\nSide-door deals An employee works on picking order items from inventory shelves at the Amazon fulfillment center in Kent, Washington, October 24, 2018. More Cramer said he did not expect Lyft shares to get hit so hard on Monday after their after a positive Friday debut on the stock market.\nThe rideshare app traded as high as $88 a share in its first day, but tumbled nearly 12 percent to settle at $69.01 on Monday. With a load of highly-anticipated companies planning to go public in 2019, he said it's a sign that investors must be very careful buying red-hot initial public offerings. Those include names such as Pinterest, Uber, and Airbnb.\nBut there is a way to make money on the IPO frenzy without buying the new stocks, Cramer said.\n\"If you want to play the IPO boom without taking the immense risk of buying these stocks right out of the gate, embrace the indirect approach and buy the more consistent winners here like Nasdaq, Goldman Sachs and Amazon,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\nStory continues Find out why here\nWaiting on the new Dow Ed Breen, Executive Chair, Dow DuPont. More DowDuPont will officially split into three new companies on Tuesday and Cramer said he thinks the separated companies, as a whole, will be worth more than before.\nWeakness in the global economy should already be baked in the security, but the prospective positives likely are not, the host said.\nFind out why Cramer's bullish on the company here\nCramer's lightning round: Stay away form anything auto and related to auto In Cramer's lightning round, he ran through his reactions to callers' stock questions:\nGoodyear Tire & Rubber Co.: \"Oh, boy.

Help shape the future of investing tools and earn a $60 gift card! This article is for investors who would like to improve their understanding of price to earnings ratios (P/E ratios). To keep it practical, we'll show how China Taiping Insurance Holdings Company Limited's ( HKG:966 ) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. China Taiping Insurance Holdings has a P/E ratio of 12.8 , based on the last twelve months. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 7.8%. How Do You Calculate China Taiping Insurance Holdings's P/E Ratio? The formula for price to earnings is: Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share \u00f7 Earnings per Share (EPS) Or for China Taiping Insurance Holdings: P/E of 12.8 = HK$23.6 \u00f7 HK$1.84 (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2018.) Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good? A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each HK$1 of company earnings. That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E. How Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios Earnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers. China Taiping Insurance Holdings increased earnings per share by an impressive 13% over the last twelve months. And earnings per share have improved by 8.3% annually, over the last five years. So one might expect an above average P/E ratio. How Does China Taiping Insurance Holdings's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers? The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (13.6) for companies in the insurance industry is roughly the same as China Taiping Insurance Holdings's P/E. More China Taiping Insurance Holdings's P/E tells us that market participants think its prospects are roughly in line with its industry. If the company has better than average prospects, then the market might be underestimating it. I inform my view by by checking management tenure and remuneration , among other things. Remember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance Sheet Don't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth. Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio. Is Debt Impacting China Taiping Insurance Holdings's P/E? Net debt totals 24% of China Taiping Insurance Holdings's market cap. It would probably deserve a higher P/E ratio if it was net cash, since it would have more options for growth. The Verdict On China Taiping Insurance Holdings's P/E Ratio China Taiping Insurance Holdings's P/E is 12.8 which is above average (11.8) in the HK market. While the company does use modest debt, its recent earnings growth is impressive. Therefore it seems reasonable that the market would have relatively high expectations of the company Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.

The fixed amount distributed per share is subject to change at the discretion of BKT's Board. If sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return capital to its stockholders in order to maintain a level distribution. The Fund is currently not relying on any exemptive relief from Section 19(b) of the 1940 Act. The Fund expects that distributions under the Plan will exceed current income and capital gains and therefore will likely include a return of capital. BKT may make additional distributions from time to time, including additional capital gain distributions at the end of the taxable year, if required to meet requirements imposed by the Code and/or the 1940 Act.\nBKT's estimated sources of the distributions paid as of February 28, 2019 and for its current fiscal year is as follows:\nEstimated Allocations as of February 28, 2019 Fund Distribution Net Investment\nIncome\nNet Realized\nShort-Term Gains\nNet Realized\nLong-Term Gains\nReturn of Capital BKT $0.034400 $0.034400 (100%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) Estimated Allocations for the Fiscal Year through February 28, 2019 Fund Distribution Net Investment\nIncome\nNet Realized\nShort-Term Gains\nNet Realized\nLong-Term Gains\nReturn of Capital BKT $0.034400 $0.034400 (100%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) The amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates and are being provided to you pursuant to regulatory requirements and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes.

The Board may amend the terms of a Plan or suspend or terminate a Plan at any time without prior notice to the Fund's shareholders if it deems such actions to be in the best interest of the Fund or its shareholders.

Us Into Thinking Hailey Baldwin Is Pregnant Erica Gonzales From Harper's BAZAAR Justin Bieber posted a photo of an ultrasound and photos of wife Hailey Baldwin in what looks like a doctor's office, sending fans madly speculating if they're having a baby. Bieber captioned the second photo \"If U thought it was April fools,\" suggesting that the pregnancy news is true, but he and Hailey have not directly confirmed if they're expecting. He ultimately admitted it was an April Fools' prank. Justin Bieber nearly broke the internet when he implied that his wife, Hailey Baldwin, was pregnant this afternoon with some cryptic Instagram posts. So is the couple, who legally wed in September, actually expecting a baby? Here's the breakdown of the popstar's string of confusing photos. He started with an ultrasound photo-which was fake. Bieber started with a photo of a sonogram, which he shared without a caption. Fans questioned whether the image was an April fool's joke. Some quickly realized that the ultrasound photo was a stock image on Google. - Shania\ud83c\udf2b (@madloveariii) April 1, 2019 He followed with pictures of Hailey at the doctor. Bieber's next post seemed a little more believable. He shared a series of photos of Baldwin sitting in a chair in what looked like a doctor's office with medical professionals touching her belly. He wrote in the caption, \"If U thought it was April fools,\" suggesting that he and the model might actually be expecting. At this point, the couple still hadn't confirmed whether they are expecting yet, but fans were already spilling into the comments of his post to express both congratulations and confusion. People freaked out on Twitter as well. hailey baldwin is pregnant.... pic.twitter.com/LwlsVu9jap - robertta fettucini (@indecisive_g) April 1, 2019 IS @haileybieber PREGNANT OR NOT - justine (@pop_aficionado) April 1, 2019 Hailey left a brief comment. ELLE points out that Hailey commented \"very funny...\" on Bieber's post, but that it seems she's deleted the comment since then. Plus hailey commented \u201cvery funny..\u201d i think he\u2019s tricking us on april fools pic.twitter.com/Q5wWcFnKcD Baldwin has been wearing baggy and draped outfits in her recent public appearances, but she's also been seen in a crop top in one of Bieber's Instagram posts. Photo credit: BG024/Bauer-Griffin - Getty Images More Justin admits it's an April Fools' joke after all. Bieber had us fooled. Less than an hour after sharing his photos with Hailey, he posted another ultrasound with a puppy photoshopped in the middle. The singer wrote in the caption: \"Wait omg is that a,,, APRIL FOOLS.\" This isn't the first time fans speculated whether the Biebers are expecting. This isn't the first time the Biebers have had their followers reeling over possible baby rumors. In an emotional Instagram post last week, Justin wrote, \"I am now very focused on repairing some of the deep rooted issues that I have as most of us have, so that I don\u2019t fall apart, so that I can sustain my marriage and be the father I want to be.\" Fans took the end of the sentence literally and wondered whether a baby was on the way for the pair. IS EVEYONE MISSING THE FACT THAT @justinbieber ANNOUNCED THAT HE AND @haileybieber ARE PREGNANT!?!?! pic.twitter.com/BYM60bgrQY - Kat Shuman (@KathleenSarah96) March 26, 2019 The fact that the Biebers want to start a family should come as no surprise. \"Justin and Hailey have talked about kids, and it\u2019s a priority to them,\" a source told Entertainment Tonight last week. \"They want to be in the right place before having them: having a home, being married and Justin being in a good mental state. The couple wants a few kids and their friends wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that happened soon.\" An insider also told People that Justin is \"ready to be a dad.\" \"That\u2019s what he wants to be,\" the source added. \"He knows that he has to get things figured out so that he can be the dad he wants to be. But that\u2019s his focus. Being a dad is his dream right now.\" ('You Might Also Like',)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a27009524/hailey-baldwin-justin-bieber-pregnancy-april-fools-joke-reaction/&quot;", "https://twitter.com/KathleenSarah96/status/1110533143075921921?ref_src=twsrc^tfw", "https://www.etonline.com/justin-bieber-has-discussed-having-kids-with-wife-hailey-source-says-122162&quot;", "http://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a27009882/justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-pregnant-instagram/&quot;", "http://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a27009882/justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-pregnant-instagram/", "https://twitter.com/madloveariii/status/1112816507547996162?ref_src=twsrc^tfw", "https://t.co/BYM60bgrQY", "https://people.com/music/justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-love-idea-parenthood-timing-god/&quot;", "https://www.etonline.com/justin-bieber-has-discussed-having-kids-with-wife-hailey-source-says-122162", "https://t.co/LwlsVu9jap", "https://twitter.com/indecisive_g/status/1112819431636230144?ref_src=twsrc^tfw", "https://twitter.com/haileybieber?ref_src=twsrc^tfw", "https://twitter.com/justinbieber?ref_src=twsrc^tfw", "https://people.com/music/justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-love-idea-parenthood-timing-god/", "https://t.co/Q5wWcFnKcD", "https://twitter.com/pop_aficionado/status/1112820909834977288?ref_src=twsrc^tfw", "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a27009524/hailey-baldwin-justin-bieber-pregnancy-april-fools-joke-reaction/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "justin bieber", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "erica gonzales from harper", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hailey baldwin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hailey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bieber", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T03:16:18.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "04ef78058597330cd7a8569b2776e5f0a93f806a", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-huon-aquaculture-group-limiteds-233353337.html", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "http://rss.news.yahoo.com/rss/business\r", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines", "title": "What Does Huon Aquaculture Group Limited's (ASX:HUO) Balance Sheet Tell Us About It?", "title_full": "What Does Huon Aquaculture Group Limited's (ASX:HUO) Balance Sheet Tell Us About It?", "published": "2019-04-02T02:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3IflV69iLQlhr8dJWyukUQ--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/36789d42f75a054353954829599305e9", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "04ef78058597330cd7a8569b2776e5f0a93f806a", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-huon-aquaculture-group-limiteds-233353337.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T02:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "What Does Huon Aquaculture Group Limited's (ASX:HUO) Balance Sheet Tell Us About It?", "text": "What Does Huon Aquaculture Group Limited's (ASX:HUO) Balance Sheet Tell Us About It? Simply Wall St Reblog Want to participate in a research study ? Help shape the future of investing tools and earn a $60 gift card! While small-cap stocks, such as Huon Aquaculture Group Limited ( ASX:HUO ) with its market cap of AU$414m, are popular for their explosive growth, investors should also be aware of their balance sheet to judge whether the company can survive a downturn. Understanding the company's financial health becomes vital, since poor capital management may bring about bankruptcies, which occur at a higher rate for small-caps. Let's work through some financial health checks you may wish to consider if you're interested in this stock. Nevertheless, these checks don't give you a full picture, so I recommend you dig deeper yourself into HUO here . HUO\u2019s Debt (And Cash Flows) HUO's debt levels surged from AU$75m to AU$134m over the last 12 months \u2013 this includes long-term debt. With this growth in debt, HUO's cash and short-term investments stands at AU$4.5m to keep the business going. On top of this, HUO has generated AU$33m in operating cash flow during the same period of time, leading to an operating cash to total debt ratio of 25%, meaning that HUO\u2019s current level of operating cash is high enough to cover debt. Can HUO meet its short-term obligations with the cash in hand? At the current liabilities level of AU$86m, the company has maintained a safe level of current assets to meet its obligations, with the current ratio last standing at 3.39x. The current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. Having said that, many consider a ratio above 3x to be high, although this is not necessarily a bad thing. More Can HUO service its debt comfortably? With debt reaching 40% of equity, HUO may be thought of as relatively highly levered. This is a bit unusual for a small-cap stock, since they generally have a harder time borrowing than large more established companies. No matter how high the company\u2019s debt, if it can easily cover the interest payments, it\u2019s considered to be efficient with its use of excess leverage. A company generating earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) at least three times its net interest payments is considered financially sound. In HUO's case, the ratio of 6.21x suggests that interest is appropriately covered, which means that lenders may be inclined to lend more money to the company, as it is seen as safe in terms of payback. Next Steps: HUO\u2019s high cash coverage means that, although its debt levels are high, the company is able to utilise its borrowings efficiently in order to generate cash flow. Since there is also no concerns around HUO's liquidity needs, this may be its optimal capital structure for the time being. Keep in mind I haven't considered other factors such as how HUO has been performing in the past.

The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a Siren Song as \"something that is very appealing and makes you want to go somewhere or do something but that may have bad results.\"\nDividend commentary The large dividend yield is what is drawing investors to Sprague Resources. In the last earnings release, management said they expect to maintain distributions at the current level for 2019. However, as investors recently saw with CenturyLink ( CTL ), it is always best not to assume anything. The similarity in commentary from management and bullish writers on Seeking Alpha is eerily similar in both the cases of SRLP and CTL. It is important to do your own due diligence, especially when looking at ultra-high yielding companies like SRLP.\nSRLP dividend commentary\nSprague expects to maintain the 2019 quarterly distributions at the current distribution level. ~ SRLP Q4 earnings release\nSRLP's management isn't looking to cut the distribution since no cut is needed. ~ Rida Morwa\nCTL dividend commentary\nWe are pleased with the improvement in our payout ratio compared to last year and remain comfortable with the dividend. ~CTL Q3 conference call Jeff Storey CEO (November 8th 2018)\nFCF seems high, but Storey has clearly committed to the dividend via goals to grow EBITDA and FCF. ~ Stone Fox Capital\nThe data points just don't reflect the dividend being at risk and warranting an 11.4% yield. ~ Stone Fox Capital\nDividend Coverage As you can see in the table below, dividend coverage has been declining for the last 4 years and is now below 1x. The reason the coverage was in 2018 was below 1x was the change in values on inventories and hedging contracts. In 2016 and 2017, these values provided a positive impact, which helped make adjusted EBITDA higher than EBITDA. That was not the case in 2018, because adjusted EBITDA was lower than EBITDA. Because Sprague Resources' business is weather-dependent and seasonal, the change in value on inventories and hedging contracts can vary wildly from year to year. Because of those wild swings, adjusted EBITDA is the best measure to see how Sprague Resources is doing. The picture is not pretty; adjusted EBITDA has declined 4 years in a row as has distributable cash flow.\nQ4 Sprague Resources supplemental\nOne of the major reasons coverage has declined is because the company has extremely low margins, which makes it tough to generate increasing adjusted EBITDA. As you can see in the table below, revenues have been increasing over the past three years and are actually up 57%. It is clear, growth in revenues has failed to translate into growth in adjusted EBITDA.\nRevenue\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA % of Revs\n2016\n$2,389,998,000\n$110,197,000\n4.61%\n2017\n$2,854,996,000\n$109,230,000\n3.83%\n2018\n$3,771,133,000\n$102,005,000\n2.70%\nTable data from SRLP end of year results\nLow Margins As a company, Sprague Resources has extremely low margins across the board. For example, Gurufocus has the ttm gross margin for SRLP at 8.86%, which is low. I looked at the FinViz universe of stocks with a market cap above $300 million (3344 stocks), and then added the parameter of having gross margins below 10%. Only 82 out of 3344 (2.45%), had gross margins below 10%. Of those 82 stocks, 79 have been on the market for at least one year, and out of those, 56 (71%) have underperfomed the S&P 500 ( SPY ) over the last year. Based on that data, it is clear that companies with low gross margins tend to underperform.\nDeclining market The heating oil business is a declining market because a limited number of houses in the United States use heating oil. The following table from the EIA shows the majority of heating oil sales come from the Northeast. The second chart shows heating oil is an expensive method of heating and as time goes on I expect that consumers will continue to move to cheaper, more efficient sources of heating like natural gas. The following statement from the EIA shows that heating oil homes are in decline.\nThe number of houses with heating systems that use heating oil is declining because homeowners are increasingly converting to other types of heating systems. Most new homes use natural gas or electricity for heating. ~ EIA\nImage Source: EIA\nImage source: Maine.gov\nSince Sprague Resources does a lot with heating oil, I expect that over time the heating oil business will continue to decline. As noted above in the EIA quote, they also believe that demand for heating oil will continue to decline because of homeowners switching to other sources. This can be seen in the data table below, where I gathered data from year-end filings for Sprague Resources. As you can see, refined products volumes have been trending lower for years and have gone nowhere over the past five year. This is important data to examine because refined products are the largest source of revenues for Sprague Resources.\nRefined Products Volume (Gallons)\n2014\n1,668,240\n2015\n1,684,158\n2016\n1,396,080\n2017\n1,416,240\n2018\n1,580,838\nTable data from SRLP filings\nClosing thoughts In closing, I believe investors need look past the 15% dividend yield to see that there are a number of issues with Sprague Resources. Sprague Resources has failed to grow adjusted EBITDA over the past 5 years, distributable cash flow is down 4 years in a row, margins are low, the largest source of revenues comes from a declining business and the business has a lot of volatility because of the weather and commodity pricing. All those factors combined make SRLP an easy stock to avoid. There are many other companies to choose from that are growing revenues, EBITDA, distributable cash flow and have higher margins. In my opinion, the 15% yield is not worth the risk, and I believe this could be another example of \u201c when chasing yield goes wrong .\u201d Stay tuned for my next article, where I will be examining the MLP market and covering the one MLP I find the most appealing.\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

American Water is a utility which includes water, electric and contracted services. The last dividend increase declared in August 2018 was an increase from 0.255/Qtr to 0.275/Qtr or a 7% increase. For the last five years, the dividend growth rate was 6.9%. AWR is not a sell but could be held to see if the recent 5-year growth is sustained.\nAmerican Water is being reviewed using the Good Business Portfolio guidelines. The company has slow steady growth and has cash it uses to increase the footprint for its services.\nWhen I scanned the five-year chart, American Water has a good chart going up and to the right in a steady, strong slope for all five years.\nData by YCharts\nFundamentals of American Water will be reviewed on the following topics below.\nThe Good Business Portfolio Guidelines Total Return and Yearly Dividend Last Quarter's Earnings Company Business Takeaways Recent Portfolio Changes I use a set of guidelines that I codified over the last few years to review the companies in The Good Business Portfolio (my portfolio) and other companies that I am reviewing. For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article \" The Good Business Portfolio: Update to Guidelines, August 2018 \". These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, total return and growing companies that hopefully keeps me ahead of the Dow average.\nGood Business Portfolio Guidelines American Water passes 8 of 11 Good Business Portfolio Guideline, a poor score (a good score is 10 or 11). These guidelines are only used to filter companies to be considered in the portfolio. Some of the points brought out by the guidelines are shown below.\nAmerican Water does meet my dividend guideline of having dividends increase for 8 of the last ten years and having a minimum of 1% yield, with increasing dividends for 64 years and a 1.5% yield. American Water is, therefore, a fair choice for the dividend income investor. The five-year average payout ratio is moderate at 59%. After paying the dividend, this leaves of cash remaining for investment in expanding the business. I have a capitalization guideline where the capitalization must be greater than $10 Billion. AWR fails this guideline. AWR is a mid-cap company with a capitalization of $2.6 Billion. American Water 2019 projected cash flow is good allowing the company to have the means for company growth. I also require the CAGR going forward to be able to cover my yearly expenses and my RMD with a CAGR of 7%. My dividends provide 3.3% of the portfolio as income, and I need 1.9% more for a yearly distribution of 5.2% plus an inflation cushion of 1.8%. The one-year forward CAGR of 6% does not meet my guideline requirement. This good future growth for American Water can continue its uptrend benefiting from the continued need for more water and electricity. My total return guideline is that total return must be greater than the Dow's total return over my test period. AWR passes this guideline since the total return is 82.30%, more than the Dow's total return of 44.48%. Looking back five years, $10,000 invested five years ago would now be worth over $24,300 today. This makes American Water a good investment for the total return investor looking back, which has future growth as the economy continues to grow and the need for more water and electricity exists. One of my guidelines is that the S&P rating must be three stars or better. AWR's S&P CFRA rating is three stars or hold with a target price of $70, passing the guideline. AWR's price is presently below the one year target. AWR is below the target price at present and has a current high PE of 35, making AWR a hold at this entry point unless you are a very long term investor and can hold AWR for at least a five years. One of my guidelines is would I buy the whole company if I could. The answer is no. The total return is great, and the five-year growth rate makes up for the low yield, making AWR is a good business to own for growth, long-term, but I don\u2019t know if the past year's growth can continue. The Good Business Portfolio likes to embrace all kinds of investment styles but concentrates on buying businesses that can be understood, makes a fair profit, invests profits back into the business and also generates a fair income stream. Most of all what makes AWR interesting is the potential long-term growth as the economy and population increase, giving you growth in a business that we all need water. Total Return and Yearly Dividend The Good Business Portfolio Guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules. When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the Good Business Portfolio. American Water is higher against the Dow baseline in my 51-month test compared to the Dow average. I chose the 51 month test period (starting January 1, 2015, and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2017, and other years that had fair and bad performance. The great total return of 82.30% makes American Water a good investment for the total return investor that also wants a steadily increasing income. AWR has a below average dividend yield of 1.5%, but in recent years the dividend has a five-year growth rate of 7%/year. The Dividend was last increased August 2018 to $0.275/Qtr. from $0.255/Qtr. or a 7.8% increase.\nDOW's 51 Month total return baseline is 44.48%\nCompany name\n51 Month total return\nThe Difference from DOW baseline\nQuarterly dividend percentage\nDanaher\n82.30%\n+37.82%\n1.5%\nClick to enlarge\nLast Quarter's Earnings For the last quarter on February 25, 2018, American Water reported earnings that beat expected by $0.02 at $0.37, compared to last year at $0.35. Total revenue was higher at $111 Million more than a year ago by 6.6% year over year and beat expected revenue by $6.71 Million. This was a fair report with bottom line beating expected and the top line is increasing and having an increase compared with last year. The next earnings report will be out May 2019 and is expected to be $0.35 compared to last year at $0.29, a moderate increase.\nThe graphic below shows the events of the earnings for the 2017 year through the end of 2018. As you can see AWR has its ups and downs.\nSource: AWR 4th quarter earnings call slides\nBusiness Overview American Water is a water and electricity regulated utility.\nAs per excerpt from Reuters :\nAmerican States Water Company, is a holding company. The Company is the parent company of Golden State Water Company (GSWC) and American States Utility Services, Inc. (ASUS), as well as ASUS' subsidiaries, including Fort Bliss Water Services Company (FBWS), Terrapin Utility Services, Inc. (TUS), Old Dominion Utility Services, Inc. (ODUS), Palmetto State Utility Services, Inc. ( PSUS) and Old North Utility Services, Inc. (ONUS).\nThe Company's segments include water, electric and contracted services. Within the segments, AWR has two principal business units, water, and electric service utility operations, conducted through GSWC, and contracted services conducted through ASUS and its subsidiaries.\nGSWC is a public utility engaged principally in the purchase, production, distribution, and sale of water. As of December 31, 2016, GSWC was engaged in purchase, production, distribution, and sale of water in 10 counties in the State of California.\nGSWC also distributes electricity in various San Bernardino County mountain communities in California through it's Bear Valley Electric Service (BVES) division. As of December 31, 2016, GSWC served 261,002 water customers and 23,940 electric customers.\"\nOverall American Water is a slow growth business with 6% CAGR projected growth as the economy grows going forward with the increasing need for more water and electricity. The fair earnings and revenue growth provides AWR the capability to continue its growth as the positive cash flow continues.\nThe Fed has kept interest rates low for some years, and on December 19, 2018, they raised the base rate of 0.25%, which was expected. I believe that they will go slow in 2019, which should help keep the economy on a growth path. If infrastructure spending can be increased, this will even increase the United States growth going forward with better economics for the consumer. At the March 20 meeting, the Fed lowered United States GDP projection for 2019 which they said are getting to neutral on the economy, projecting no rate increases for 2019. The Fed meeting statement was a wait and see and a bit more dovish than the last meeting.\nOn the February 25, 2019, earnings call , Bob Sprowls (Chief Executive officer and President) said:\nFor American States Water and its two subsidiaries, 2018 represented a continued unwavering commitment to safe and reliable service for our water, wastewater and electric customers, both in California, as well as in eight other states where we serve the country\u2019s military personnel and their families. We concluded 2018 with two settled rate cases for our water and electric utilities, a record level of capital investment in our regulated utility, earned a record high earnings per share contribution at our contracted services subsidiary, commenced operations of water and our wastewater systems at our 11th military base, and continued our 64 consecutive year of history of dividend increases.\nAt Golden State Water Company, we reached settlements with the California Public Utilities Commission\u2019s, Public Advocates Office on all issues for our pending water and electric rate cases. The water rate case sets new rates for the years 2019 through 2021, while the electric rate case, under the settlement, will set new rates for 2018 through 2022. We continue to invest in the reliability of our systems, spending a historical high of $121 million in needed infrastructure during the year.\nAt American States Utility Services or ASUS, we achieved the highest annual earnings per share contribution. In 2018, we further grew our military base footprint by commencing operations at our newest base, Fort Riley; increased our services at existing bases, and continue to work with the U.S. government on price adjustments and asset transfers.\nASUS now provides services for water and our wastewater systems, and treatment plants to 11 military bases, including some of the largest military installations in the United States, Fort Bragg; Fort Bliss; Eglin Air Force Base and Fort Riley; as well as one of the most high-profile bases, Joint Base Andrews.\nThis shows the feelings of top management to the continued growth of the American Water business and shareholder return with an increase in future growth. AWR has good constant slow growth and will continue as the need for more water and electricity grows.\nTakeaways American Water is a good investment choice for the total return growth investor. American Water will not be considered for The Good Business Portfolio. If you want a growing total return in a utility business AWR may be the right investment for you. The entry price right now is slightly below the one-year forward calculated target price, and the PE ratio is very high for a relatively low growth investment, so AWR is not a buy for me.\nRecent Portfolio Changes I intend to watch the earnings reports for the companies in the portfolio and may finally decide to trim my high flyers that are over 8% of the portfolio so I can invest in good companies on my buy list.\nOn March 26, trimmed position of Hewlett Packard ( HPQ ) from 1.0% of the portfolio to 0.6%. The last earnings report was poor, and future growth looks weak at 2%, time to sell HPQ for a better business. On March 22 added to position of Simulation Plus ( SLP ) from 0.45% of the portfolio to 0.60%. I will add slowly to this position as available cash allows. On March 13 increased position of Realty Income Corp. ( O ) to 0.85% of the portfolio, I could use a bit more steady monthly income. On March 12 the portfolio closed out the position of Arconic ( ARNC ), I only have one more commodity play Freeport McMoRan ( FCX ) that I think will go up over time. On March 11 the portfolio reduced the position of Arconic from 0.4% of the portfolio to 0.3%. I will sell the rest of this position within the month. The dividend was just cut, and forward growth is under-par. On March 7 added to position of Simulation Plus from 0.33% of the portfolio to 0.45%. I will add slowly to this position as available cash allows. On March 4, trimmed position of Hewlett Packard ( HPQ ) from 1.3% of the portfolio to 1.0%. The last earnings report was poor, and future growth looks weak at 2%, time to sell HPQ for a better business. On February 28, trimmed position of Boeing ( BA ) from 16.1% of the portfolio to 15.8%. I love Boeing, but you have to have diversification. On February 2 increased position of Realty Income Corp. to 0.7% of the portfolio, I could use a bit more steady monthly income. On January 30 increased the position of Simulations Plus from 0.2% of the portfolio to 0.4%. I think their product may be the product of the future for drug testing. On January 28 Bought a starter position of Realty Income Corp. , I could use a bit more steady income and hope to add to this holding in the future. Realty Income Corp. is now 0.4% of the portfolio. On January 28 sold the remaining portion of Mondelez ( MDLZ ). The forward growth does not look good enough. The Good Business Portfolio trims a position when it gets above 8% of the portfolio. The five top percentage of the portfolio companies in the portfolio are, Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) is 8.3% of the portfolio, Eaton Vance Enhanced Equity Income Fund II ( EOS ) is 8.0% of the portfolio, Home Depot ( HD ) is 8.8% of the portfolio, Omega Health Investors ( OHI ) 8.1% of the portfolio and Boeing ( BA ) is 13.8% of the portfolio. Therefore BA, EOS, JNJ, OHI, and Home Depot are now in trim position, but I am letting them run a bit since they are great companies.\nBoeing is going to be pressed to 15% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on 787 deferred plane costs at $316 Million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase from the fourth quarter. The first quarter earnings for 2018 were unbelievable at $3.64 compared too expected at $2.64. Farnborough Air Show sales in dollar value just beat out Air-Bus by about $6 Billion, and both companies had a great number of orders. Boeing received an order for 18 more KC-46A planes. The second quarter 2018 earnings beat expectations by $0.06 at $3.33, but a good report was hurt by a write off expense on the KC-46 which has started delivery in 2019. Two KC-46A tankers were delivered in January 2019. As a result of the good fourth-quarter earnings, S&P CFRA raised the one-year price target to $500 for a possible 20% upside potential. Boeing has dropped in the last 2 weeks because of the second 737 Max-8 crash, and I look at this as an opportunity to buy BA at a reasonable price. This is just my opinion.\nJNJ will be pressed to 9% of the portfolio because of its defensive nature in this post-BREXIT world. Earnings in the last quarter beat on the top and bottom line and Mr. Market did nothing. JNJ has an estimated dividend increase to $0.97/Qtr. in April 2019, which will be 57 years in a row of increases. JNJ is not a trading stock but a hold forever; it is now a strong buy as the healthcare sector remains under pressure.\nFor the total Good Business Portfolio, please see my article on The Good Business Portfolio: 2018 4 th Quarter Earnings and Performance Review for the complete portfolio list and performance.

Many believe the technical signal could portend more gains for stocks in the short term.\nGains in global equities were spurred by data showing that China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly returned to growth in March for the first time in four months.\n\"The Chinese numbers bounced back, and people are taking more risk today because of it,\" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.\nUS manufacturing numbers for March were also better than expected, helping investors overlook soft retail sales data for February.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 329.74 points, or 1.27 percent, to 26,258.42, the S&P 500 gained 32.79 points, or 1.16 percent, to 2,867.19, and the Nasdaq Composite added 99.59 points, or 1.29 percent, to 7,828.91.\nConcerns about a global economic slowdown have dimmed sentiment since the Federal Reserve announced in late January that its monetary tightening would end earlier than expected, as it cited \"cross currents\" affecting the economy. The shift in Fed policy drove yields on 10-year Treasury notes below those of three-month bills last week for the first time in more than a decade.\nYields on 10-year notes have since risen back above three-month bill rates and on Monday hit a one-week high. Monday's rise in the 10-year Treasury yield helped lift financial shares, which provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500 among the index's 11 sectors. S&P 500 bank shares jumped 2.9 percent.\n\"Treasury yields had priced in a gloomy outlook, and now they're unwinding some of that negativity,\" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. \"So we're seeing money moving back into cyclical areas, which is why financials are big leaders today.\"\nConcerns about slowing momentum have not entirely dissipated. With the first-quarter corporate earnings reporting season about two weeks away, investors are bracing for what may be the first US profit decline since 2016. Analysts expect quarterly earnings to fall 2 percent, according to Refinitiv data.\nStill, on Monday, most S&P sectors rose. Only consumer staples, real estate and utilities shares, which tend to decline as 10-year Treasury yields rise, were in the red.\nAuto shares rose after China's State Council said on Sunday that the country would continue to suspend additional tariffs on import of US vehicles and auto parts after April 1.\nGeneral Motors Co shares added 1.8 percent and Ford Motor Co shares gained 2.3 percent.\nChipmakers, which draw much of their revenue from China, also rose. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index advanced 2.5 percent.\nShares of Wynn Resorts Ltd jumped 8.4 percent, the most among S&P 500 companies, as March gambling revenue from the Chinese territory of Macau rose from the previous month.\nLyft Inc shares tumbled 11.9 percent to end below their IPO price after brokerage Guggenheim Securities started coverage of the ride-hailing company's shares with a \"neutral\" rating. Lyft debuted on the Nasdaq on Friday.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.99-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.11-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nThe S&P 500 posted 63 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 68 new highs and 28 new lows.\nVolume on US exchanges was 7.11 billion shares, compared to the 7.47 billion average over the last 20 trading days. \u2014 Reuters", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael o'rourke", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jonestrading", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenwich", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T03:22:15.038+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b02a1089f830535e1ca8f830503fd5a2422871c", "url": "https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1102098/us-suspends-f-35-deliveries-to-turkey-over-russian-arms", "site_full": "newsinfo.inquirer.net", "site": "inquirer.net", "site_section": "http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Inquirer News", "title": "US suspends F-35 deliveries to Turkey over Russian arms", "title_full": "US suspends F-35 deliveries to Turkey over Russian arms", "published": "2019-04-02T02:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/files/2016/08/F-35-620x348.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 813, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 142, "comments": 6, "shares": 12}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4b02a1089f830535e1ca8f830503fd5a2422871c", "url": "https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1102098/us-suspends-f-35-deliveries-to-turkey-over-russian-arms", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cbibe", "published": "2019-04-02T02:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "US suspends F-35 deliveries to Turkey over Russian arms", "text": "A flight of F-35 stealth fighters conducts a training mission.

partnership, but the (Defense Department) is taking prudent steps to protect the shared investments made in our critical technology,\u201d the statement said.\nThe purchase of a Russian system is

said Monday, suggesting the planes could stay grounded a while longer.\nThe Boeing 737 MAX 8, operated by Ethiopian Airlines, crashed on March 10, southeast of Addis Ababa (AFP Photo/TONY KARUMBA)\nAdditional work is needed \u201cto ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues,\u201d a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said in a statement.\n\u201cThe FAA will not approve the software for installation until the agency is satisfied with the submission,\u201d he added.\nThe FAA statement is the bureaucratic equivalent of a \u201cstop\u201d sign after Boeing officials touted their proposed remedy last week during a media tour at the company\u2019s manufacturing plant in Seattle, Washington.\nBoeing\u2019s 737 MAX planes were grounded globally last month following the second of two deadly crashes to occur in less than five months.\nScrutiny has centered on an anti-stall system developed specifically for the planes that has given pilots problems.\nA preliminary report into the second calamity \u2014 the March 10 crash of a Boeing 737 MAX 8 that killed 157 people \u2014 will likely be issued this week, the Ethiopian government said Monday.\nBoeing last week gathered hundreds of pilots and reporters at its Renton, Washington manufacturing site for a presentation on proposed changes to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which is believed to have been a key factor in the Ethiopian crash and in an October crash of a Lion Air in Indonesia that killed 189 people.\nAmong the changes, the MCAS will no longer repeatedly make corrections when the pilot tries to regain control, and will automatically disconnect in the event of disagreements between the two \u201cangle of attack,\u201d or AOA sensors, the company said last week.\nBoeing is anxious to win approval for a proposed remedy that could get the planes back in the air.\nBut the FAA, which faced harsh questioning last week at a congressional hearing regarding its oversight of Boeing, said it expected Boeing to submit the proposed fix \u201cover the coming weeks\u201d after it undertakes additional work.\nAfter that, the proposal will be submitted to a \u201crigorous safety review,\u201d the FAA spokesman said.\nA Boeing spokesman said Monday the company was continuing to work with regulators to address concerns.\n\u201cWe are working to demonstrate that we have identified and appropriately addressed all certification requirements and will be submitting for FAA review once completed in the coming weeks,\u201d the Boeing spokesman said.\n\u201cSafety is our first priority and we will take a thorough and methodical approach to the development and testing of the update to ensure we take the time to get it right.\u201d\nPreliminary report this week\nEarlier Monday, Ethiopian foreign ministry spokesman Nebiat Getachew had said his country\u2019s transport ministry would release \u201ca preliminary report into its investigation\u201d of the March 10 accident in which a Nairobi-bound Boeing 737 MAX crashed shortly after taking off from Addis Ababa.\nThe Ethiopian government gave no details on the exact timing of the release, nor hints about the report\u2019s findings.\nNebiat initially said the report would be released Monday but the transport ministry, which is in charge of investigations, later said this would take several days.\n\u201cThe report will most likely be released some day later this week,\u201d ministry spokesman Mussie Yiheyes said.\nIt was not clear Monday if the transport ministry\u2019s preliminary report would be made public straight away, or limited to the eyes of authorities including the FAA.\nThe plane\u2019s black boxes are being examined by France\u2019s BEA air safety agency, working with American and Ethiopian investigators to determine what went wrong.\nAnti-stall system\nA source with knowledge of the investigation has said an anti-stalling system, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), was activated shortly before the crash.\nBoeing designed the automated MCAS system \u2014 which lowers the aircraft\u2019s nose if it detects a stall or loss of airspeed \u2014 for this particular model.\nThe same system was implicated in the October crash, with initial investigations finding that a sensor on the plane had transmitted incorrect information to the MCAS system.\nThe pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 struggled to control the aircraft as the MCAS repeatedly pushed the plane\u2019s nose down, according to the flight data recorder.\nThe pilot had tried repeatedly to regain control and pull the nose up but the plane crashed into the sea.\nBoth the planes in Indonesia and Ethiopia reportedly experienced erratic steep climbs and descents, as well as fluctuating airspeeds, before crashing shortly after takeoff.\nEthiopia has already said there were \u201cclear similarities\u201d between the two MAX 8 crashes.\nEthiopian Airlines is Africa\u2019s largest carrier and in many ways the international face of the nation.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

States of impeding aid efforts and \u201ceconomic terrorism\u201d on Monday as authorities ordered the immediate evacuation of flood-stricken cities in western Iran.\nUS sanctions are \u201cimpeding aid efforts by #IranianRedcrescent to all communities devastated by unprecedented floods,\u201d Zarif tweeted, referring to search and rescue operations being conducted after huge rainfalls triggered vast flooding.\n\u201cBlocked equipment includes relief choppers,\u201d the tweet read, adding that \u201cthis isn\u2019t just economic warfare; it\u2019s economic TERRORISM.\u201d\nThe evacuation was ordered after rivers burst their banks, dams overflowed and vast areas were cut off from communication.\nA chronic shortage of rescue helicopters in Iran, due to US sanctions, has forced the emergency services to request help from military helicopters and amphibious armoured personnel carriers to assist in the rescue operations.\nThe authorities declared a \u201csituation red\u201d, the highest level of alert, in Lorestan province with four or five cities \u201ccompletely critical\u201d, state television news network IRINN reported from Khorramabad, the region\u2019s capital.\n\u201cIn Khorramabad the water has risen by as much as three metres (nearly 10 feet) in parts\u2026 and reports are coming in of regions\u2026 completely submerged with residents stranded on their rooftops,\u201d it added.\nThe Red Crescent\u2019s provincial director, Sarem Rezaee, said his organisation had lost contact with much of the region.\n\u201cTelephones are not working, our radio communications are down\u2026 at this moment we have no news of other cities and villages,\u201d he told IRINN, adding roads were flooded and helicopters were unable to take off due to the bad weather.\n\u201cWe have requested emergency help from neighbouring provinces but at the present no one can do anything.\u201d\nThe airport in the western city of Khorramabad was flooded, with images showing water submerging the runway and cutting the province\u2019s main air link to the rest of the country.\nAuthorities in Lorestan ordered evacuations in many regions, bringing in the armed forces to forcibly remove those who do not comply, local media reported.\n\u2018Lost all contact\u2019\nThe authorities said Pol-e-Dokhtar and Mamulan cities were already half submerged, with one fatality reported in Mamulan.\nImages on local media show water gushing through streets in Pol-e-Dokhtar where the water level had reached 1.5 metres (five feet).\nEvery village in the vicinity of the two cities had been surrounded by flood waters while all five dams in Lorestan had reached capacity and four of them were overflowing.\n\u201cWe have lost all contact with Pol-e-Dokhtar,\u201d the Lorestan Governor General Mousa Khademi told the semi-official ISNA News Agency.\n\u201cWe do not have any information on the situation there\u2026 we do not know how many people have been affected by the floods,\u201d he added.\nNumerous rivers had burst their banks and landslides blocked many roads, said the reports.\nMedia outlets showed images of collapsed bridges and oil and gas pipelines destroyed by the flood.\nThe main railway line linking Tehran to the south of the country had also been blocked by the flood.\nThis is the third major flood to hit Iran in the past two weeks with unprecedented rainfalls in the mostly arid country that had endured a decades-long drought until this year.\nThe first occurred in the northeast of the country on March 19 and the second struck the west and southwest of Iran on March 25 with a combined toll of 45 people killed.\nThe present flood has again struck in the west and southwest following heavy rain that is set to continue into Tuesday.\nApart from Lorestan half a dozen other provinces are also facing critical circumstances, with the emergency services reporting 23 out of Iran\u2019s 31 provinces have been affected and could face floods.\nWith the consecutive floods the reservoirs of many dams have reached full capacity forcing emergency discharge, as much as 1,800 cubic metres per second in some cases, to prevent them

Demand for cruises, outdoor activities, travel, ski, boating, to name a few, generally accelerate during this time of the year. Apart from favorable weather, spring break holidays also drive demand for such services.\nHowever, it should be noted that this demand is purely subject to general economic conditions. Elastic demand is highly dependent on the business cycle and derives momentum from a healthy labor market, rising wages and growing disposable income.\nCurrent Economic Scenario\nPer a few analysts, the U.S. economy in 2019 can be characterized as a Goldilocks scenario, where the system is operating in an optimal state by providing full employment and economic stability. The economy is neither too dull to cause recession, nor too bright to result in inflation.\nThe U.S. economic outlook is healthy according to key economic indicators. The economy has an ideal GDP growth rate of 2-3% and moderately rising prices, as measured by the core inflation rate. The Federal Reserve has set the target inflation rate for 2019 at 2%.\nAlthough, the country's GDP growth is likely to slow to growth of 2.1% in 2019 from 3% in 2018 (per the Federal Open Market Committee meeting), unemployment, which is at 3.7%, will continue to support overall economic spending.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, personal consumption expenditure (PCE) contributed 1.66 percentage points to overall growth and rose 2.5%. Although 2019 may witness a subdued economic growth, recession and restrained demand is unlikely. Both Fed's monetary policy and Congress' fiscal policy aim to create enough demand to keep the economy whirring at a healthy pace.\nStrong Demand to Facilitate Growth in the Leisure Space\nApart from higher personal expenditure, increased demand for leisure products and services is also aiding the leisure industry of late. According to a report by Statista, revenues at the sports and outdoor space are expected to witness a CAGR of 9% from 2018 to 2023. User penetration stood at 12.2% in 2018 and is expected to reach 16.7% by 2023.\nPer Deloitte, retailers of leisure goods have been witnessing robust growth since 2010. Furthermore, a report by Global Market Insights suggests that the boating market share in the United States will surpass $28.5 billion by 2024. National Marine Manufacturers Association had also mentioned that boat manufacturers are continuously increasing production to support high demand. Demand for powerboats, including small sterndrive, wakeboard boats and smaller fiberglass boats with jet technology is rapidly increasing.\nThe cruise industry in 2019 is likely to benefit from increased travel demand. The role of technology is playing a massive role in driving demand for cruises. The companies continue to make use of digital tools for marketing, product development and enhancing consumer experience.\nMoreover, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL noted that the Wave Season has witnessed a solid start and overall booking in 2019 is likely to exceed the record mark in 2018. Per the Cruise Lines International Association , the cruise industry is expected to grow through 2019 with 30 million cruisers, up 6% from 28.2 million in 2018.\nFurther, 2018 has been a record-breaking year for the lodging industry given an optimal demand supply balance. Per CBRE researchers, the hotel industry is likely to continue on a growth trajectory in 2019. Additionally, CBRE anticipates overall returns on hotels to be the highest for any commercial real-estate sector over the next three years.\nPicking the Right Stocks\nWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener , we have zeroed in on five promising stocks from the leisure industry that can lift your spring spirit.

(NYSE:TSN)", "text": "By Callum Turcan\nImage shown: Tyson's share price has come roaring back since the doldrums of December 2018.\nTyson Foods ( TSN ) is one of the leading providers of protein products in the world and yields 2.2% as of this writing. During its 2018 fiscal year, which ended in late-September 2018, the company sold products in approximately 125 countries including China, Japan, countries within the European Union, various countries in the Middle East, and elsewhere. In order to counterbalance the volatile nature of the commodities business and move into a space with higher margins, Tyson has been expanding its branded value-add product offerings such as ready-to-eat sandwiches, prepared meals, breakfast sausages, and numerous other items under the Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, Ball Park, Wright, State Fair, Aidells, Gallo Salame, and Golden Island brands.\nIn this article, let's talk about our skepticism regarding Tyson's ability to reward shareholders through dividend increases, given its acquisition program. We'll also assess the company's valuation, with shares trading at the midpoint of our estimate of the company's range of potential fair value estimate outcomes. We're not huge fans of Tyson fundamentally (its economic profit spread is good though), but we might consider the idea in the newsletter portfolios should it step up its deleveraging efforts. We'd also prefer that its share price fall toward the lower end of our estimate of its range of potential fair value outcomes (price matters), of course, but that's not all that we look at. We'd like to see both enterprise valuation support (intrinsic value support) as well as strengthening technical/momentum indicators, at the same time, to really grow excited.\nWe talk a lot about the importance of combining enterprise valuation (not just the traditional quant value factor) and technical momentum indicators in our new book. We believe combining these two considerations into a methodology helps investors avoid value traps. It doesn't look to us that Tyson's share price is down for the count (see image at the top of this article), which gives us some confidence that the company is not one of those dreaded value traps. With shares fairly valued at the moment and the company's share price holding up, it's not one that we're too worried about. That doesn't mean that we're ready to jump into the idea just yet, however. We'd like to see its share price trading below our estimate of its intrinsic value, something we will talk about later in the note.\nEvaluating Tyson's Business Risk Only one company represented more than 10% of Tyson\u2019s consolidated revenue during its FY2018 , and that was Walmart Inc ( WMT ). The giant big-box retailer accounted for 17.3% of Tyson\u2019s sales last fiscal year, representing one of the company\u2019s most important corporate relationships. If anything were to happen to that relationship, Tyson would likely suffer material financial harm. Tyson\u2019s bargaining power has increased tremendously since going on its acquisition spree, as the firm added numerous top tier brand names to its roster. The kinds of products that consumers would really miss if they weren\u2019t readily available.\nAny relationship; corporate, government, or otherwise, that constitutes a large part of a company\u2019s business profile is one that needs to be monitored. It\u2019s unlikely that Tyson and Walmart would want to jeopardize their relationship for the foreseeable future. Tyson has had to recall some of its products in America this calendar year including 69,000 pounds of ready-to-eat chicken strips and 18 tons of \u201cWhite Meat Panko\u201d chicken nuggets. Recall worries are another big risk for food product producers, with only solid operational execution offering some protection from an inherent risk in the industry.\nAcquisition spree Back in 2014 , Tyson agreed to purchase The Hillshire Brands Company in an all-cash deal valued at almost $8.6 billion when including the net debt Tyson would take on. That was followed up by the all-cash deal in 2017 to buy AdvancePierre Foods Holdings Inc. in a transaction worth $4.2 billion (including the assumption of debt). Management didn\u2019t stop there, as Tyson would go on to buy Keystone Foods from Marfrig Global Foods S.A. ( OTCPK:MRRTY ) for $2.2 billion in cash through a deal made last year.\nAll of these purchases were based in part on operational synergies (realizing economies of scale in the food products industry) and gaining a much larger portfolio of branded value-add products. Tyson even announced it was going to spend $340 million buying the Thai and European operations of BRF S.A. ( BRFS ) in February 2019. That included four processing facilities in Thailand, one in the United Kingdom, and one in the Netherlands along with brands like Speedy Pollo and Grabits.\nThese major acquisitions are how Tyson has aggressively moved into the value-add branded products arena over the past five years. In FY2013 , Tyson\u2019s GAAP gross margin came in at 6.9% as its GAAP operating income clocked in at 4.0%. Fast forward to FY2018 , and Tyson\u2019s GAAP gross margin had firmed up to 12.8% while its GAAP operating income jumped to 7.6%. However, it\u2019s worth noting that since FY2016, Tyson\u2019s GAAP gross and operating margins have been broadly flat. The company had made tremendous headway with improving its profitability early on after the Hillshire purchase, but margin expansion appears to have stalled out since then. During Tyson\u2019s latest quarterly conference call with investors management noted that,\nI am confident in our ability to integrate the BRF operations in part due to the pace and level of team working taking place with the Keystone integration. Keystone is already playing an important role in our growth strategy, and we look forward to maximizing the opportunities inherent in the combined business that benefit our customers as we strive to meet their needs and grow together.\nAs part of the integration process for Keystone, a few weeks ago we announced several organizational changes. This refinement of our team will help us make the most of our biggest growth opportunities which are value added foods in the international markets. I am glad to have everyone on board and the team is eager and motivated to deliver results.\u201d\nWe will be monitoring the integration process to see if margin expansion will resume as Tyson continues onward with its acquisition spree. A corporate organization combined with a renewed focus on selling more branded valued-added food to international markets may do the trick.\nAt the end of FY2013 , Tyson was sitting on $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents versus $0.5 billion in short-term debt and $1.9 billion in long-term debt, good for a net debt load of almost $1.3 billion. By the end of FY2018 , Tyson\u2019s cash and cash equivalents had shrunk to $0.3 billion while its short-term and long-term debt load climbed by to $1.9 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, good for a net debt load of $9.6 billion. Clearly, its acquisition spree has come at the expense of its balance sheet in a bid to become a much larger enterprise with differentiated food product offerings.\nTyson has allocated a moderate amount of its free cash flow generation over the years to keep its net debt position contained. That being said, as a serial acquirer, the company continues to take on debt. By the end of Tyson\u2019s first quarter FY2019 , the firm had a net debt position of $11.6 billion ($3.9 billion in short-term debt plus $8.1 billion in long-term debt minus $0.4 billion in cash).\nFree cash flow and dividend coverage analysis Tyson generated $3.0 billion in net operating cash flow in FY2018 , up 14% year over year as its net income surged from $1.8 billion in FY2017 to $3.0 billion in FY2018. Capital expenditures climbed up by 12% on an annual basis in FY2018 to $1.2 billion, leaving $1.8 billion for free cash flow generation. Free cash flow generation was up 15% from FY2017 levels.\nThe company spent $0.4 billion on dividend payments in FY2018, leaving plenty of free cash flow for $0.4 billion in share buybacks with the remainder going towards net debt reduction. Management indicated that Tyson would be paying down debt built up from recent acquisitions as its capital expenditures will remain contained relatively speaking. During the firm\u2019s latest quarterly conference call with investors, management stated that Tyson\u2019s current net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio stood at 2.8x, which is above past target levels that called for a leverage ratio closer to 2.0x.\nWe note that Tyson has consistently generated free cash flow over the past few years, enabling the company to boost its quarterly dividend from $0.05 per share in late 2013 to $0.375 per share as declared in February 2019. However, its large net debt load makes further dividend growth harder to sustain going forward.\nIn order to systematically evaluate the quality of a company\u2019s dividend coverage in a way that can be applied to any company operating in any industry, we like to use free cash flow analysis. Our work to assess dividend health measures its expected free cash flow generation over the next five years, derived through our discounted cash flow analysis which is conducted in a fastidious manner, less its net debt position (vice-versa for net cash), with that total then getting divided by its expected dividend obligations during the observed period.\nAfter our work is all finished in this capacity, Tyson registers a ratio of 0.9x, earning the company a poor assessment with respect to dividend safety, by our marks. Our dividend growth potential assessment is also very poor, not because it hasn\u2019t increased its payout in the past (or that it won't in the near term), but because future increases will have to contend with deleveraging efforts. It's worth reiterating: we're not expecting Tyson to cut its payout due to the less-than-ideal ratio (in fact, we're forecasting modest growth), but it does mean that investors should start to watch the situation more closely. Debt cuts both ways (positive or negative) depending on where the company is in the economic cycle. That said, if Tyson were to halt its buying spree, the company's balance sheet would improve materially, and perhaps its dividend resilience would follow, too.\nEvaluating past and future returns on invested capital\nImage shown: Our calculations of return on invested capital.\nOver time, Tyson's return on invested capital has exceeded its weighted average cost of capital. We also expect a spread between these two metrics over the next five years, which is based on our pro forma financial analysis of the company. As a result, we give Tyson's business quality high marks as the company has shown that it is fully capable of properly integrating new assets into its corporate profile in order to realize better margins and growth opportunities. Scoring well in these categories means on a fundamental level, the company is performing strongly, but note that is different than viewing the company in terms of valuation (which is a function of investor expectations of business quality, not necessarily business quality itself). As it relates to the context of valuation, Tyson is trading near the midpoint of our estimate of its fair value range of outcomes, indicating shares are fairly priced as of this writing (see image below).\nConcluding thoughts All things considered, Tyson is doing the right things as far as its corporate profile is concerned, but its ability to reward shareholders through dividend increases remains limited until the acquisition spree stops or margin expansion continues sometime in the not too distant future. How well Tyson is able to integrate the newest additions to its portfolio will be key. Looking ahead, the company's outlook isn't bad at all :\nFor fiscal 2019, USDA indicates domestic protein production (beef, pork, chicken and turkey) should increase approximately 3% from fiscal 2018 levels, but we expect domestic availability of protein to increase approximately 2% as export markets should absorb a portion of the increase in production.\nSales \u2013 For fiscal 2019, we expect sales to grow to approximately $43 billion due to volume growth and mix, as well as the impact of the Keystone acquisition. Most of the sales growth is expected to occur in our Chicken segment and Other, as well as expected growth in our Prepared Foods segment after excluding the impact of the divestitures\nReaffirming Adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal 2019 of $5.75-$6.10.\nTyson's bottom line guidance was about in line with expectations . As of this writing, Tyson trades at the midpoint of its range of potential fair value estimate outcomes (based on our enterprise valuation process), so a moderate amount of share repurchases should be viewed as acceptable - meaning shares aren't ridiculously expensive where it is blatantly obvious management is too aggressive with buyback deployment.\nWe, as always, would still prefer Tyson consider stepping up its deleveraging efforts to ensure a safe and healthy dividend over the long haul, unless of course, its share price falls toward the lower end of its range of potential values, at which buying back stock may be the best move. The situation is always a dynamic one. Tyson has a strong business, great returns on capital, a solid outlook, but leverage and its so-so valuation keep us less enthused about its stock at current levels.\nImage Shown: Tyson trades just above our range of potential values, which is derived from our rigorous discounted cash flow analysis\nAuthor\u2019s note: Some of the companies mentioned above don\u2019t trade on a major U.S. stock exchange, which come with their own unique sets of risks and rewards.

Summers Jr. said.\n\"Should Turkey procure the S-400, their continued participation in the F-35 program is at risk,\" he said in a statement.\nUS officials have voiced concern that, with Turkey in both camps, Russia could obtain F-35 data to improve the accuracy of the S-400 against Western aircraft.\nThe Pentagon said that it had started to look at secondary sources to produce parts for F-35s that were being developed in Turkey.\n\"We very much regret the current situation facing our F-35 partnership with Turkey, but the (Defense Department) is taking prudent steps to protect the shared investments made in our critical technology,\" Summers said.\nTurkey had planned to buy 100 F-35A fighter jets, with pilots already training in the United States. The plane's manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, said that contracts with Turkish companies to build parts for the F-35 had been expected to reach $12 billion.\nAmong the eight Turkish companies involved in the purchase, Ayesas has been building a panoramic cockpit display for the F-35 and Fokker Elmo makes 40 percent of the electrical wiring and interconnection system, according to Lockheed Martin.\n- Growing tilt to Russia -\nThe purchase of a Russian system is highly unusual for a member of NATO, the Western alliance forged to counter the Soviet Union.\nThe US suspension announcement comes two days before foreign ministers from the 29 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are due in Washington to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the alliance -- and hours after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's AKP party suffered a surprise rout in elections in major cities including Istanbul.\nErdogan, whose relations with the West have soured sharply as he cracks down on dissent at home, has increasingly looked to Moscow as a partner. Russian tourists have made Turkey their top destination, providing a vital economic boost.\nLast week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov traveled to Turkey, where Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu insisted that the S-400 purchase would go ahead.\n\"We have an agreement with Russia and we are bound by it,\" Cavusoglu told reporters.\nHoping to offer an alternative, the United States last year approved the sale of Patriot missiles to Turkey -- a deal to which Ankara said it was open.\nFour senators last week proposed legally barring the transfer of F-35s to Turkey if it buys the S-400. One of the senators, Democrat Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, praised the Pentagon suspension and pledged to \"continue working in the Senate to prevent this dangerous possibility from becoming a reality.\"\n- Rocky ties with US -\nTurkey's relations with the United States plunged last year when President Donald Trump imposed tariffs, battering Turkey's lira, over the jailing of an American pastor detained as part of a mass roundup following a coup attempt against Erdogan.\nThe pastor, Andrew Brunson, was freed and Trump appeared to grow fond of Erdogan, speaking to him before his sudden decision to withdrew US troops from Syria.\nBut tensions quickly resurfaced with the United States fearful that Erdogan will strike US-allied Kurdish fighters in Syria and a Turkish court trying a US consulate staffer, Metin Topuz, on charges of spying.\nTopuz, a Turkish citizen, is accused of ties to Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish preacher who lives in self-imposed exile in the United States. Erdogan has repeatedly demanded that the United States extradite Gulen, whom the Turkish leader accuses of fomenting the coup.\n? 2019 AFP", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mevlut cavusoglu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "anta", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sergei lavrov", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "charles e. summers jr.", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antalya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T03:36:42.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "23b7130d7d3905b0a63027c7dd18ec1e00946284", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/mexicos-top-security-officials-says-he-entered-us-illegally", "site_full": "www.foxnews.com", "site": "foxnews.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/latest?format=xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FOX News", "title": "Mexico's top security officials says he entered US illegally", "title_full": "Mexico's top security officials says he entered US illegally | Fox News", "published": "2019-04-02T04:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/og/og-fox-news.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 185, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "23b7130d7d3905b0a63027c7dd18ec1e00946284", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/mexicos-top-security-officials-says-he-entered-us-illegally", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Associated Press", "published": "2019-04-02T04:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Mexico's top security officials says he entered US illegally", "text": "1 day ago Last Update 12 hours ago Mexico\u2019s top security official crossed illegally into US twice in his youth looking for work Illegal immigrants find different ways to enter the US Mexico \u2019s top security official, who has pledged to weed out criminals from migrant caravans , said he understands the plight of people crossing into the U.S. illegally as he admitted doing the same when he was younger.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory\nThe United States has halted delivery of equipment related to the stealthy F-35 fighter aircraft to Turkey, marking the first concrete U.S. step to block delivery of the jet to the NATO ally in light of Ankara\u2019s planned purchase of a Russian missile defense system.\nU.S. officials told their Turkish counterparts they will not receive further shipments of F-35 related equipment needed to prepare for the arrival of the stealthy jet, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday.\nThe Pentagon confirmed the Reuters report that the equipment delivery had been stopped.\nRELATED COVERAGE Pentagon halts deliveries, activities linked to Turkey\u2019s F-35 capability \u201cPending an unequivocal Turkish decision to forgo delivery of the S-400, deliveries and activities associated with the stand-up of Turkey\u2019s F-35 operational capability have been suspended,\u201d Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Mike Andrews, a Defense Department spokesman, said in a statement.\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan has refused to back down from Ankara\u2019s planned purchase of a Russian S-400 missile defense system that the United States has said would compromise the security of F-35 aircraft.\nThe disagreement over the F-35 is the latest of a series of diplomatic disputes between the United States and Turkey including Turkish demands that the United States extradite Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, differences over Middle East policy and the war in Syria, and sanctions on Iran.\nThe sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the next shipment of training equipment, and all subsequent shipments of F-35 related material, had been canceled. The aircraft is built by Lockheed Martin Corp.\nA Pentagon official had told Reuters in March that the United States had a number of items it could withhold in order to send Turkey a signal that the United States was serious about Ankara dropping its ambition to own the S-400.\nTurkish officials in Ankara were not immediately available for comment. Turkey has said it will take delivery of the S-400s in July.\nNATO SUMMIT The U.S. decision on the F-35s was expected to complicate Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu\u2019s visit to Washington this week for a NATO summit. On Sunday, Erdogan suffered one of his biggest electoral losses in decades in local elections.\n\u201cCertain Russian weapon systems are seen as inherently threatening to the United States regardless of who is operating them and for what purpose,\u201d Andrew Hunter, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said.\n\u201cBecause Turkey is not just an F-35 purchaser, but an industrial partner, blocking delivery of these systems represents a major escalation by the United States as it threatens to impose serious costs on both sides,\u201d Hunter said.\nReuters reported last week that Washington was exploring whether it could remove Turkey from production of the F-35. Turkey makes parts of the fuselage, landing gear and cockpit displays. Sources familiar with the F-35\u2019s intricate worldwide production process and U.S. thinking on the issue last week said Turkey\u2019s role can be replaced.\nThe United States and other NATO allies that own F-35s fear the radar on the Russian S-400 missile system will learn how to spot and track the jet, making it less able to evade Russian weapons.\nIn an attempt to persuade Turkey to drop its plans to buy the S-400, the United States offered the pricier American-made Patriot anti-missile system in a discounted deal that expired at the end of March. Turkey has shown interest in the Patriot system, but not at the expense of abandoning the S-400.\nTurkey has engaged with U.S. negotiators in recent days about buying the Patriot system, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The system is made by Raytheon Co.\nTurkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar in March said that despite some issues, Turkish pilots were continuing their training at an air base in Arizona on the F-35, each of which costs $90 million, and that Ankara was expecting the aircraft to arrive in Turkey in November.\nBy halting jet deliveries, the Pentagon could subsequently delay training of Turkish pilots. Two additional jets are scheduled to arrive in Arizona in April and a significant delay could impact Turkey\u2019s November target date for operations.\nU.S. lawmakers also have expressed alarm over Turkey\u2019s planned purchase of the Russian system. Four U.S. senators last week introduced a bipartisan bill that would prohibit the transfer of F-35s to Turkey until the U.S. government certifies that Ankara will not take delivery of the S-400 system.\nFollowing news of the halt, U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, one of the bill sponsors, said she was glad to hear the administration was \u201cto delay the transfer of F-35 equipment to Turkey to help ensure U.S. military technology and capabilities cannot fall into the hands of the Kremlin.\u201d\nReporting by Mike Stone and Humeyra Pamuk in Washington; editing by Will Dunham, Howard Goller and Lisa Shumaker Report typos and corrections to [email protected] About the Author Reuters.com brings you the latest news from around the world, covering breaking news in business, politics, technology, and more.

(April 1, 2019) - Today, the U.S. (EPA) announced significant accomplishments at two Superfund sites on the Administrator's Emphasis List of Superfund Sites Targeted for Immediate, Intense Action (Administrator's Emphasis List). After achieving critical short-term milestones, the Madison County Anschutz Mine, Fredericktown, Missouri and Tar Creek, Ottawa County, Oklahoma were removed from the list. One site - Olin Chemical, Wilmington, Massachusetts \u2013 was added to facilitate cleanup and redevelopment activities. With this update, there are a total of 15 Superfund sites on the list, and a total of 13 sites have been removed from the Administrator's Emphasis List since December 2017 because the short-term milestones were achieved.\n\"Removing Madison County Anschutz Mine and Tar Creek from the Administrator's Emphasis List and adding Olin Chemical demonstrate EPA's continued progress in accelerating cleanup activities that protect human health and the environment while revitalizing local communities,\" said EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler. \"The cleanups at these sites further the commitment EPA made in the federal Lead Action Plan to address lead contamination at Superfund sites and reduce exposure to residents.\"\nThe Madison County Anschutz Mine was placed on the Administrator's Emphasis List to promote the timely implementation of a property-wide cleanup of historical surficial mine waste contamination proposed by the new owners, which will also allow for the beneficial re-use of the property and potentially create significant economic benefit for the local community. The new property owners intend to re-open a former cobalt mine, which could employ hundreds of residents. EPA and the new owners signed an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent to conduct the work. Sitewide, the EPA has completed the remediation of over 626,000 cubic yards of soil at more than 1,900 residential properties in and around Fredericktown, in addition to cleaning up approximately 87 acres of mine waste. EPA's response actions have resulted in a significant reduction of elevated blood lead in children throughout Madison County where the percentage has dropped from around 27 percent in 1996, to less than 2 percent today.\nEPA released a draft strategic plan to advance the cleanup of the Tar Creek Superfund site on March 11, 2019. The release of the strategic plan fulfills two major milestones identified for the site on the Administrator's Emphasis List. The first milestone required identification and evaluation of opportunities to accelerate site cleanup. The second milestone compelled EPA and the Bureau of Indian Affairs to work with the Quapaw Nation to establish the tribe's ability to establish institutional controls on their properties. Some near-term cleanup actions include the partial deletion of up to 5,000 acres, amending the 2008 record of decision for mining waste, and issuing a new record of decision for the watersheds. Long-term actions include exploring innovative technologies to expedite the cleanup and identifying additional re-use opportunities. Prior cleanup activities at the site resulted in a significant reduction of elevated blood lead levels in children from 35 percent to 4 percent.\nThe Olin Chemical Superfund site was added to the Administrator's Emphasis List with the goal of expediting the selection of a remedy to remediate soil, surface water, and areas of highest groundwater contamination.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez got into an exchange Monday after Cheney mocked the freshman congresswoman for flubbing the history of the U.S. Constitution.\nOcasio-Cortez claimed during an MSNBC town hall Friday that the Democratic party was at its strongest when former President Franklin D. Roosevelt was in office and consequently, that the 22nd Amendment was ratified to keep FDR from running for another term.\n\u201cThey had to amend the Constitution of the United States to make sure Roosevelt did not get reelected,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said at the time. \u201cThere were so many extraordinary things that were happening at that time that were uniting working people.\u201d\nThe 22nd Amendment, however, was passed in 1947, two years after Roosevelt died \u2014 an error that Cheney pointed out.\n\u201cWe knew the Democrats let dead people vote,\u201d Cheney tweeted. \u201cAccording to [Ocasio-Cortez], they can run for President, too.\u201d\nWe knew the Democrats let dead people vote.

However, Newsweek changed the headline from \u201cAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez Attacked On Twitter For Constitutional Mistake \u2014 But Was She Actually Right?\u201d to \u201cAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez Attacked On Twitter For Constitutional Mistake \u2014 But Here\u2019s The Full Story.\u201d\n\u201cHey Rep.

Gregory Bull, File/AP Photo Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney on Sunday said President Trump was serious in his threat to close the US border with Mexico if action is not taken to curtail illegal immigration. Trump said in a tweet Saturday he would order the closure of the border \"for a very long time,\" in a move economists have warned could derail US growth prospects. Border and administration officials though, believe the threatened closure wouldn't work, and claim that officials have not been told to prepare for an impending closure. Axios reported that the widespread view in both the White House and US Homeland Security is that a total border closure is \" a terrible and unworkable idea.\" Illegal immigration has been one of the flash points of Trump's presidency, with the president elected on a pledge to stop the flow of migrants into the country.\nTop White House aides on Sunday claimed that President Trump's pledge to close the US border with Mexico is no empty threat - but border officials have raised questions over the government's power to make it happen.\nSpeaking on ABC News' This Week Sunday, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said that it would take \"something dramatic\" for the president to change his mind and back down from his pledge to act in a week if Mexico doesn't step up. On Fox News Sunday White House counselor Kellyanne Conway added that the president's threat was \"no bluff.\" Mulvaney also reiterated Trump's pledge to cut off hundreds and millions of dollars in aid to the Central American countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador over their alleged failure to curb illegal migration.\nTrump had on Saturday renewed attacks on Mexico for failing to curtail illegal immigration, and threatened to close the border \"for a very long time\" if the country doesn't act.\n\"Next step is to close the Border! This will also help us with stopping the Drug flow from Mexico!\" - Trump tweeted. President Donald Trump tours the U.S. border with Mexico at the Rio Grande on the southern border. AP/Evan Vucci\nBut amid warnings from economists and political opponents that sealing off the border with the US' third largest trading partner could spell mass job losses and price hikes, border and administration officials have questioned if the order could even to put into practise.\nAxios reported Sunday that the widespread view in the White House and Department of Homeland Security is that Trump's plan is \"terrible\" and \"unworkable,\" while administration officials told the site it is \"unlikely\" Trump will follow through on his threat. Speaking anonymously to the Washington Post, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official said that the Trump administration had provided no details about the president's intentions and border officials had received no instructions to prepare to implement the order.\nThe official said that to close the border, the administration would need to notify Congress and labor unions representing border officials - measures unlikely to be completed in a week, the timeframe laid down by the president.\nOther critics have pointed out that many undocumented migrants cannot be physically prevented entering the country, as they often seek out remote parts of the border to cross into US territory, where they hand themselves into border officials and claim asylum. Asylum seekers and children cannot be quickly deported from the US. In this Jan. 4, 2016 file photo, a U.S. Border Patrol agent drives near the U.S.-Mexico border fence in Santa Teresa, N.M. Associated Press/Russell Contreras\nA senior administration official, clarifying the president's comments, told Vox on Friday that with border officials diverted from ports of entry to process undocumented migrants, the government would be forced to close those ports of entry as a last resort.\nThe US Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIllegal immigration has been one of the flash points of the Trump presidency, with the president elected to office on the back of a pledge to build a wall along the US-Mexican to curtail the flow of immigrants to the country, and accused by critics of using inflammatory rhetoric to stir up hostility to migrants.\nSeeking to regain the initiative in the week following the submission of the Mueller report which allies claimed lifted the cloud of suspicion of colluding with Russia from the president, Trump on Friday was again talking tough on migration. He claimed the US was out of detention space for undocumented migrants and threatened to close the border if two caravans of migrants made it into the US.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-white-house-doubles-down-on-threat-to-close-us-mexico-border/2019/03/31/bd2e070a-53c9-11e9-9136-f8e636f1f6df_story.html?utm_term=.bb7613b764c6", "https://www.vox.com/2019/3/29/18287101/trump-close-border-us-mexico-tweets", "https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-threat-shut-down-border-could-cost-american-businesses-millions-1381650", "https://www.axios.com/trump-post-mueller-investigation-immigration-fed-obamacare-7fa5d4ce-4c32-4437-a089-73951c794670.html", "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/29/politics/donald-trump-border-closure-again/index.html", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1112091249153134598", "http://exslt.org/strings"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mick mulvaney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom porter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gregory bull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "white house", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "us border patrol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us homeland security", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tijuana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T03:46:46.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2138fdf2c5a38eb06281e8738eabd86f1574b1f9", "url": "https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2019/4/1/us-suspends-f-35-deliveries-to-turkey-over-russian-arms", "site_full": "www.alaraby.co.uk", "site": "alaraby.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The New Arab ", "title": "US suspends F-35 deliveries to Turkey over Russian arms", "title_full": "US suspends F-35 deliveries to Turkey over Russian arms", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/file/getimagecustom/2535b0b1-5128-4288-8fcc-849b5295a500/600/338", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9479, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1071, "comments": 77, "shares": 66}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2138fdf2c5a38eb06281e8738eabd86f1574b1f9", "url": "https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2019/4/1/us-suspends-f-35-deliveries-to-turkey-over-russian-arms", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The New Arab & agencies", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "US suspends F-35 deliveries to Turkey over Russian arms", "text": "The United States said on Monday it was halting all deliveries and joint work with Turkey on the F-35 fighter jet program after the NATO ally insisted on a major purchase from Russia.

Help shape the future of investing tools and earn a $60 gift card! While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Mahindra CIE Automotive Limited ( NSE:MAHINDCIE ). Over the last twelve months Mahindra CIE Automotive has recorded a ROE of 13% . One way to conceptualize this, is that for each \u20b91 of shareholders' equity it has, the company made \u20b90.13 in profit. How Do I Calculate Return On Equity? The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity Or for Mahindra CIE Automotive: 13% = \u20b95.5b \u00f7 \u20b943b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2018.) Most know that net profit is the total earnings after all expenses, but the concept of shareholders' equity is a little more complicated. It is the capital paid in by shareholders, plus any retained earnings. You can calculate shareholders' equity by subtracting the company's total liabilities from its total assets. What Does ROE Mean? Return on Equity measures a company's profitability against the profit it has kept for the business (plus any capital injections). The 'return' is the yearly profit. A higher profit will lead to a higher ROE. So, all else being equal, a high ROE is better than a low one . That means ROE can be used to compare two businesses. Does Mahindra CIE Automotive Have A Good ROE? By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. The image below shows that Mahindra CIE Automotive has an ROE that is roughly in line with the Auto Components industry average (13%). More That's neither particularly good, nor bad. ROE tells us about the quality of the business, but it does not give us much of an idea if the share price is cheap. I will like Mahindra CIE Automotive better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying. How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity? Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used. Combining Mahindra CIE Automotive's Debt And Its 13% Return On Equity Mahindra CIE Automotive has a debt to equity ratio of 0.38, which is far from excessive. Its ROE isn't particularly impressive, but the debt levels are quite modest, so the business probably has some real potential. Judicious use of debt to improve returns can certainly be a good thing, although it does elevate risk slightly and reduce future optionality. In Summary Return on equity is one way we can compare the business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better. But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

The yield curve is first and foremost predicting the outlook for Fed policy rather than the next recession. My research has confirmed this conclusion, as does a recent Fed study.\nIn my recent book, Predicting the Markets , Quote: : \u201cThe Yield Curve Model is based on investors\u2019 expectations of how the Fed will respond to inflation. It is more practical for predicting interest rates than is the Inflation Premium Model. It makes sense that the federal-funds rate depends mostly on the Fed\u2019s inflation outlook, and that all the other yields to the right of this rate on the yield curve are determined by investors\u2019 expectations for the Fed policy cycle.\u201d\nMore specifically, after studying the relationship between the yield curve and the monetary, credit, and business cycles, we have concluded that it is credit crunches, not inverted yield curve, and not aging economic expansions that cause recessions. The yield curve is just keeping score on how the Fed is reacting to and influencing these cycles. So why do inverted yield curves have such a good track record in calling recessions , and could it be different this time ?\n: The yield curve inverted \u2014 here are 5 things investors need to know\nAccording to a July 2018 Fed study about the yield curve, the probability of a recession was around 14%. However, a February 2019 update of this study reported that the odds had risen to 50%. That recession warning might have contributed to the remarkable pivot from a hawkish to a dovish stance by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets the Fed\u2019s monetary policy.\nThe Fed recently signaled that there won\u2019t be any rate hikes this year and only one next year. If so, this should reduce the chances of a recession. Let\u2019s have a close look at the Fed study, which confirms our view about the best interpretation of the yield curve:\nLast year, the minutes of the June 12-13 FOMC meeting offered a reason not to worry about the flattening yield curve at that time. During the meeting, Fed staff presented an alternative \u201cindicator of the likelihood of recession\u201d based on research explained in a June 28 FEDS Notes titled \u201c(Don't Fear) The Yield Curve\u201d by two Fed economists, Eric C. Engstrom and Steven A. Sharpe. In brief, they questioned why a \u201clong-term spread\u201d between the 10-year (BX:TMUBMUSD10Y) and two-year (BX:TMUBMUSD02Y) Treasury notes should have much power to predict imminent recessions. As an alternative, they devised a 0- to-6-quarter \u201cnear-term forward spread\u201d based on the spread between the current level of the federal-funds rate and the expected federal-funds rate several quarters ahead, derived from futures market prices ( Fig. 1 ).\nThe authors stressed that the long-term spread reflects the near-term spread, which they argue makes more sense as an indicator of a recession that is expected to occur within the next few quarters. They also observe that an inversion of either yield spread does not mean that the spread causes recessions.\nAt the time, their assessment was that \u2018the market is putting fairly low odds on a rate cut over the next four quarters,\u2019 i.e., 14.1% ( Fig. 2 ). \u201cUnlike far-term yield spreads, the near-term forward spread has not been trending down in recent years, and survey-based measures of longer-term expectations for short term interest rates show no sign of an expected inversion,\u201d they observed. In our commentary last year, we concluded: \u201cWhat a relief! So now, all we have to worry about is a recession caused by a trade war!\u201d\n(provided by The Street)\nClick to expand Replay Video UP NEXT Nor'easter strengthens off the East Coast An April Nor'easter is taking shape along the Carolina Coast which will impact the major metro cities of the Northeast by Wednesday.

The near-term spread \u201cpredicts four-quarter GDP growth with greater accuracy than survey consensus forecasts. Furthermore, \u201cit has substantial predictive power for stock returns,\u201d find the Fed economists. In contrast, yields on bonds \u201cmaturing beyond 6-8 quarters are shown to have no added value for forecasting either recessions, GDP growth, or stock returns.\u201d\nBuried on page 7 of the new study is a warning that the probability of a recession had increased significantly since the original study was done about a year ago: \u201cAs of the end of the sample period in early 2019 (and the time of this writing), the near term forward spreads forecast a substantially elevated probability of a recession.\u201d\nIndeed, Figure 3 in the study clearly shows that recession risk jumped to 50% (based on first-quarter 2019 data available only through January). Interestingly, this important update wasn\u2019t mentioned in the summary paragraph at the beginning of the study. However, the charts in the paper show that the odds of a recession increase most significantly when the near-term forward spread is markedly below zero, which it was not as of the most recent analysis.\nAccordingly, we\u2019re not freaking out about an impending recession. We are focusing on the idea promoted in the Fed study (and in my book) that the yield curve first and foremost is predicting the outlook for monetary policy. For example, the paper noted that \u201cthe near-term forward spread would tend to turn negative when investors decide that the Fed is likely to soon switch from a tightening to an easing stance.\u201d\nThe yield-curve spread tends to narrow during periods when the Fed is raising the federal-funds rate ( Fig. 3 ). It tends to bottom and then widen when the Fed starts to lower interest rates. It just so happens that past recessions occurred after the yield curve inverted, i.e., at the tail end of monetary tightening cycles.\nIt might be different this time, if the Fed has paused on a timely basis from raising interest rates any further, thus reducing the chances of a recession. After all, there\u2019s no need to overdo tightening given that inflation and speculative excesses remain subdued. In the past, Fed tightening (not inverted yield curves that coincided with tightening) led to financial crises, which morphed into widespread credit crunches, resulting in recessions ( Fig. 4 ).\nHence our conclusion that it is credit crunches that cause recessions, not inverted yield curves and not aging expansions.\nDrawing parallels between monetary policy in 1998 and today, Engstrom\u2019s and Sharpe\u2019s paper stated: \u201cThe most prominent false positive during our sample came with the anticipated easing triggered by the spread of the Asian financial crises in 1998, which did not result in a recession in the U.S. It is not hard to imagine that similar scenarios could generate additional false positives in the future. The near-inversion of the near term forward spread at the end of 2018 seems to have been associated with market perceptions of significant risks to the global economic outlook, including the threat of escalating trade disputes. Whether those risks manifest in a recession remains to be seen.\u201d\nThe Fed study notes: \u201cWe define the near-term forward spread on any given day as the difference between the implied interest rate expected on a three-month Treasury bill six quarters ahead and the current yield on a three-month Treasury bill.\u201d\nAccording to Haver Analytics (our data vendor): \u201cWe had been in touch with the Board about the 0-to-6 Quarter Forward Spread earlier this year and they had told us they calculated it using an internal fitted zero coupon curve in quarterly maturities. They only make annual maturities available at the moment so we cannot calculate.\u201d\nSo instead of trying to calculate the Fed study\u2019s near-term spread, we will focus on the 12-month forward futures for the federal-funds rate, which is available daily ( Fig. 5 ). The two-year Treasury note yield tracks this series closely, suggesting that it is also a good proxy for the market\u2019s prediction of the federal-funds rate a year from now.\nAfter all that work, the conclusion is the obvious one: The Fed isn\u2019t likely to be raising the federal-funds rate over the next 12 months. Last Monday, the 12-month forward rate was 2.06%, 32 basis points below the 2.38% midpoint of the federal-funds rate target range. The two-year was 2.24%, 14 basis points below the midpoint late last week.\nThe Fed study suggests to us that the spread between the two-year Treasury yield and the federal-funds rate may be the simplest way to track the fixed-income market\u2019s outlook for monetary policy over the next 52 weeks ( Fig. 6 ). Anyone can do this at home. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the market will be right, as evidenced by how wrong it turned out to be last year.\nThe bottom line: For now, we still don\u2019t see a significant risk of a recession, especially since the FOMC remains \u201cpatient.\u201d The committee\u2019s recent decision to pause hiking the federal-funds rate over the rest of this year reduces the risk of a financial crisis triggering both a credit crunch and a recession.\nEd Yardeni is president of Yardeni Research, Inc.

The yield curve is first and foremost predicting the outlook for Fed policy rather than the next recession. My research has confirmed this conclusion, as does a recent Fed study.\n\"> In my recent book, Predicting the Markets , Quote: : \u201cThe Yield Curve Model is based on investors\u2019 expectations of how the Fed will respond to inflation. It is more practical for predicting interest rates than is the Inflation Premium Model. It makes sense that the federal-funds rate depends mostly on the Fed\u2019s inflation outlook, and that all the other yields to the right of this rate on the yield curve are determined by investors\u2019 expectations for the Fed policy cycle.\u201d\nMore specifically, after studying the relationship between the yield curve and the monetary, credit, and business cycles, we have concluded that it is credit crunches, not inverted yield curve, and not aging economic expansions that cause recessions. The yield curve is just keeping score on how the Fed is reacting to and influencing these cycles. So why do inverted yield curves have such a good track record in calling recessions , and could it be different this time ?\n: The yield curve inverted \u2014 here are 5 things investors need to know\nAccording to a July 2018 Fed study about the yield curve, the probability of a recession was around 14%. However, a February 2019 update of this study reported that the odds had risen to 50%. That recession warning might have contributed to the remarkable pivot from a hawkish to a dovish stance by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets the Fed\u2019s monetary policy.\nThe Fed recently signaled that there won\u2019t be any rate hikes this year and only one next year. If so, this should reduce the chances of a recession. Let\u2019s have a close look at the Fed study, which confirms our view about the best interpretation of the yield curve:\nLast year, the minutes of the June 12-13 FOMC meeting offered a reason not to worry about the flattening yield curve at that time. During the meeting, Fed staff presented an alternative \u201cindicator of the likelihood of recession\u201d based on research explained in a June 28 FEDS Notes titled \u201c(Don't Fear) The Yield Curve\u201d by two Fed economists, Eric C. Engstrom and Steven A. Sharpe. In brief, they questioned why a \u201clong-term spread\u201d between the 10-year (BX:TMUBMUSD10Y) and two-year (BX:TMUBMUSD02Y) Treasury notes should have much power to predict imminent recessions. As an alternative, they devised a 0- to-6-quarter \u201cnear-term forward spread\u201d based on the spread between the current level of the federal-funds rate and the expected federal-funds rate several quarters ahead, derived from futures market prices ( Fig. 1 ).\nThe authors stressed that the long-term spread reflects the near-term spread, which they argue makes more sense as an indicator of a recession that is expected to occur within the next few quarters. They also observe that an inversion of either yield spread does not mean that the spread causes recessions.\nAt the time, their assessment was that \u2018the market is putting fairly low odds on a rate cut over the next four quarters,\u2019 i.e., 14.1% ( Fig. 2 ). \u201cUnlike far-term yield spreads, the near-term forward spread has not been trending down in recent years, and survey-based measures of longer-term expectations for short term interest rates show no sign of an expected inversion,\u201d they observed. In our commentary last year, we concluded: \u201cWhat a relief! So now, all we have to worry about is a recession caused by a trade war!\u201d\n(provided by The Street)\nClick to expand Replay Video UP NEXT Trump moves to vastly expand offshore drilling Trump moves to vastly expand offshore drilling USA TODAY Jeff Bezos security chief: Saudis involved in hack of Amazon CEO's cellphone The National Enquirer's parent company, AMI, is denying a report that the Saudi government hacked into the cellphone of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.

Fox Business 2:15 See how this family travels the world for next to nothing GOBankingRates 1:47 UP NEXT The updated Fed study dated February 2019 has a less jazzy title: \u201cThe Near-Term Forward Yield Spread as a Leading Indicator: A Less Distorted Mirror.\u201d The authors observe that their near-term spread \u201ccan be interpreted as a measure of the market's expectations for the near-term trajectory of conventional monetary policy rates.\u201d\nIn addition, they report: \u201cIts predictive power suggests that, when market participants expected \u2014 and priced in \u2014 a monetary policy easing over the subsequent year and a half, a recession\u201d was likely forthcoming. The near-term spread \u201cpredicts four-quarter GDP growth with greater accuracy than survey consensus forecasts. Furthermore, \u201cit has substantial predictive power for stock returns,\u201d find the Fed economists. In contrast, yields on bonds \u201cmaturing beyond 6-8 quarters are shown to have no added value for forecasting either recessions, GDP growth, or stock returns.\u201d\nBuried on page 7 of the new study is a warning that the probability of a recession had increased significantly since the original study was done about a year ago: \u201cAs of the end of the sample period in early 2019 (and the time of this writing), the near term forward spreads forecast a substantially elevated probability of a recession.\u201d\nIndeed, Figure 3 in the study clearly shows that recession risk jumped to 50% (based on first-quarter 2019 data available only through January). Interestingly, this important update wasn\u2019t mentioned in the summary paragraph at the beginning of the study. However, the charts in the paper show that the odds of a recession increase most significantly when the near-term forward spread is markedly below zero, which it was not as of the most recent analysis.\nAccordingly, we\u2019re not freaking out about an impending recession. We are focusing on the idea promoted in the Fed study (and in my book) that the yield curve first and foremost is predicting the outlook for monetary policy. For example, the paper noted that \u201cthe near-term forward spread would tend to turn negative when investors decide that the Fed is likely to soon switch from a tightening to an easing stance.\u201d\nThe yield-curve spread tends to narrow during periods when the Fed is raising the federal-funds rate ( Fig. 3 ). It tends to bottom and then widen when the Fed starts to lower interest rates. It just so happens that past recessions occurred after the yield curve inverted, i.e., at the tail end of monetary tightening cycles.\nIt might be different this time, if the Fed has paused on a timely basis from raising interest rates any further, thus reducing the chances of a recession. After all, there\u2019s no need to overdo tightening given that inflation and speculative excesses remain subdued. In the past, Fed tightening (not inverted yield curves that coincided with tightening) led to financial crises, which morphed into widespread credit crunches, resulting in recessions ( Fig. 4 ).\nHence our conclusion that it is credit crunches that cause recessions, not inverted yield curves and not aging expansions.\nDrawing parallels between monetary policy in 1998 and today, Engstrom\u2019s and Sharpe\u2019s paper stated: \u201cThe most prominent false positive during our sample came with the anticipated easing triggered by the spread of the Asian financial crises in 1998, which did not result in a recession in the U.S. It is not hard to imagine that similar scenarios could generate additional false positives in the future. The near-inversion of the near term forward spread at the end of 2018 seems to have been associated with market perceptions of significant risks to the global economic outlook, including the threat of escalating trade disputes. Whether those risks manifest in a recession remains to be seen.\u201d\nThe Fed study notes: \u201cWe define the near-term forward spread on any given day as the difference between the implied interest rate expected on a three-month Treasury bill six quarters ahead and the current yield on a three-month Treasury bill.\u201d\nAccording to Haver Analytics (our data vendor): \u201cWe had been in touch with the Board about the 0-to-6 Quarter Forward Spread earlier this year and they had told us they calculated it using an internal fitted zero coupon curve in quarterly maturities. They only make annual maturities available at the moment so we cannot calculate.\u201d\nSo instead of trying to calculate the Fed study\u2019s near-term spread, we will focus on the 12-month forward futures for the federal-funds rate, which is available daily ( Fig. 5 ). The two-year Treasury note yield tracks this series closely, suggesting that it is also a good proxy for the market\u2019s prediction of the federal-funds rate a year from now.\nAfter all that work, the conclusion is the obvious one: The Fed isn\u2019t likely to be raising the federal-funds rate over the next 12 months. Last Monday, the 12-month forward rate was 2.06%, 32 basis points below the 2.38% midpoint of the federal-funds rate target range. The two-year was 2.24%, 14 basis points below the midpoint late last week.\nThe Fed study suggests to us that the spread between the two-year Treasury yield and the federal-funds rate may be the simplest way to track the fixed-income market\u2019s outlook for monetary policy over the next 52 weeks ( Fig. 6 ). Anyone can do this at home.

ago Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nFans who've seen Peele's newest horror movie probably noticed the Hands Across America imagery at the beginning of the movie. But viewers might not know that Nicole Richie has an Us connection , and the actor made the best joke about it in an Instagram post about the movie. Spoilers ahead for Jordan Peele's Us .\n\"#TBT to my, and my Tethers first television appearance #HandsAcrossAmerica @usmovie,\" Richie captioned her Instagram post. She shared a video from a 1986 Hands Across America commercial, which featured her and other children singing the \"Hands Across America\" song. Richie, who would have been about 4 at the time of the commercial shoot, isn't in Us , but there is a scene where the young Adelaide watches a commercial for the 1986 charity event, so one could say that the former reality-star almost has a cameo in the film.\nAs Vanity Fair explained, Hands Across America was an event that encouraged people to hold hands across the country on May 25, 1986, in an effort to raise money to fight homelessness. The event worked, to some extent, as the magazine pointed out, with almost five million people, including President Reagan, joining hands with each other. But the event cost somewhere between $14 million and $16 million to execute, and it only raised $15 million in donations, Vanity Fair reported. Despite all of the advertising (and the song), it was hardly a victory in terms of actual charitable fundraising.\nBack to Us , though: Peele used the event and the hand-holding imagery to chilling effect in the movie. The Tethered hold hands with each other in the film, and Richie shared a still featuring the characters doing just that in her Instagram post.\nPeele has talked about why he chose to use the Hands Across America imagery during various interviews, as well. He told Vanity Fair , \"Hands Across America was this idea of American optimism and hope, and Ronald Reagan-style-we-can-get-things-done-if-we-just-hold-hands. It's a great gesture \u2014 but you can't actually cure hunger and all that.\"\nActions speak louder than words, and the charity event's failure to raise a net profit for charity illustrates that point. \"It made us feel like we had accomplished something. And we could go on about our '80s lives,\" Peele said to Uproxx in a separate interview, adding that he reconsidered the event after seeing a Hands Across America commercial on YouTube. \"It took me down this path to really think about this movie in terms of this country and the idea of demonstration or protest, or even performance art, and to imagine what the evil doubleganger version of what Hands Across America would be.\"\nWith the Us connection in mind, the Hands Across America promo seems a lot creepier than it might have when it first aired more than 30 years ago. And the comments on Richie's Instagram post hint at the commercial's newfound creepiness. Both fans and fellow celebrities chimed in, and it sounds like people won't think of the charity event, or its promotions, the same way again. \"No ma'am,\" Jennifer Garner commented on Richie's post. Jessica Seinfeld, meanwhile, commented with the coffin emoji.\nIt looks like Peele was far from the only person who found the Hands Across America imagery more than a little strange. In a twisted way, it was perfect for the horror movie. And even Richie seems to be on board with the dark take on the vintage commercial.

Markets to scan policy statement for cues regarding the timing of the rate cut.\nA strong Aussie housing data released soon before press time has failed to put a bid under the Aussie dollar, leaving the AUD/USD pair largely unchanged on the day at 0.7112.\nAustralia building permits surged 19.1 percent month-on-month in February, beating an estimated drop of 1 percent by a big margin. The permits had gone up by 2.5 percent in January.\nThe annualized figure, however, came in at -12.5 percent, marking a big drop from the preceding month's 28.6 percent rise and has likely taken the shine of the big beat in month-on-month number.\nFurther, the above-forecast month-on-month figure may not alleviate concerns of a housing market slowdown, as data released last week showed the housing credit growth hit a record low in February. A slide in credit growth is often followed by a deeper drop in housing prices.\nAs a result, the AUD's lackluster reaction to the big beat on building permits isn't surprising. As of writing, the currency pair is trapped between the 50-day moving average (MA) and the 10-day MA, currently at 0.7118 and 0.7103, respectively.\nThe range could be breached to the downside if the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) sounds dovish later today, reinforcing expectations of two rate cuts this year.

It operates with over 750 branches in 8 different states and continues to grow each year. The company was founded in 1856 and has been growing its customer and location base quite nicely. As a conservative lender, it has been able to withstand the test of time and not falter during economic recessions. In fact, M&T Bank has not posted a loss going back to 1976. The company has been a longtime holding of Warren Buffett's as well, which is always nice to see that the legendary investor approves of the company. As the loan market starts to slow, we look to see where M&T Bank shares offer opportunity for long-term investors.\nPerformance M&T Bank reported earnings in the middle of January that were quite pleasant.\n(Source: Seeking Alpha )\nThe company beat on both the top and bottom lines and reported healthy revenue growth of 5%+.\nThe bank saw net income grow 69% year over year and 4% quarter over quarter.\n(Source: Earnings Release )\nThis tells us there wasn't a slowdown as we headed into the end of the year, in which many other regional banks reported almost no growth. In fact, M&T Bank really hasn't seen much growth in its loan balances either.\nLoans and leases were $88.5 billion as of the end of the quarter, compared to $88 billion a year before. While there was growth in commercial loans and commercial real estate loans that was partially offset by residential mortgage loan repayments, the company also hasn't seen much growth in its deposits.\nTotal deposits were $90.2 billion, compared to $92.4 billion the year before. Without growing deposits, the only way the company can make more conservatively is through higher rates. We are now seeing that rates are probably not going to rise anymore, which will begin to put pressure on earnings in the meantime. Additionally, higher deposits, of course, only help when there are attractive loans to be made. Much of this depends on a strong economy, strong home buying, and strong auto buying. While we are seeing a peak in all of these categories, it has not slowed much. Investors should be hopeful that with the recent decline in rates, we may see home buying pick up a bit. However, we also must keep in mind M&T Bank operates in a region that, due to recent tax law changes, is seeing a large portion of its wealthy residents move out of state. This would probably hamper the overall loan quality in the long run as the higher credit quality customers look to move to lower tax states.\nFor 2018, the bank earned a whopping $12.86 per share, which was 46% higher than the year before. While much of this was due to the tax law changes, it has effectively made the shares trade at a cheaper multiple, which we will see shortly. Additionally, M&T Bank repurchased over 3 million shares during the recent quarter at an average cost per share of $163.34, for a total cost of $500 million. And for all of 2019, the company repurchased 12.3 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $2.2 billion. This is quite substantial considering the bank trades with a market cap of less than $22 billion. Seeing the bank repurchase almost 10% of its outstanding shares in one year is impressive, to say the least.\nLastly, the bank is improving all of its key ratios to ensure it is a strong operator.\n(Source: Investor Presentation )\nThe company has improved its efficiency ratio to 51% as of the fourth quarter, compared to 54% the year before. It has also seen its charge-off ratios decline return on assets improve. All notable metrics and something investors should always keep an eye on.\nValuation Compared to some other peers, we see how the valuation of M&T Bank looks.\nData by YCharts\nIt looks like the bank is expensive compared to most peers. With its forward P/E higher than most peers, as well as its yield being lower and P/B being the highest, the company looks like it is not offering much of a discount at all compared to the others in its peer group.\nCompared to M&T Bank's own trading history for the last 5 years, we see that the shares are offering some value.\n(Source: Seeking Alpha )\nCurrently, shares trade at a discount compared to their 5-year average for P/S, P/E, forward P/E, and P/CF. These signal perhaps that with a reversion to the mean, there could be upside for investors at these levels.\nLastly, looking at the historical average yield, we can see if shares offer an above-average dividend.\n(Source: YieldChart )\nSince 1995, the shares have offered an average yield of around 2.19%. Currently, with shares yielding around 2.5% and a dividend hike foretasted around the corner, they are offering an enticing dividend. However, as we saw before, this is lower than that of peers. It is notable to state that the company was one of only two banks in the S&P 500 which did not lower its dividend during the recession. While I like above-average dividends, I would look to start a position when the yield is closer to 3%. This has only happened around 10% of the time in the last 24 years of trading.\nConclusion M&T Bank shares are quite expensive when compared to peers. While shares trade off of their highs, I believe that since rates will be not going any higher for the rest of the year, shares may offer a better entry point. Should the earnings reports begin to show the lack of growth year over year, investors may take their money out of the company and look to other, larger banks for an investment in the space. As a regional player, the company doesn't have the large trading operations many of the national banks have to help bolster earnings in times of slowing loan growth. However, it is a conservative lender with a strong history, and I believe shares do deserve a premium. I would look to start a position when M&T Bank yields around 3%, or approximately $132 a share. We will see what this valuation may imply with the next dividend increase coming up, as it should of course change the level at which a 3% yield becomes attainable.\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Halting the delivery of parts and manuals needed to prepare for the aircraft\u2019s planned delivery this summer is the first step toward ending the actual aircraft sale.\n\u201cThe United States has been clear that Turkey\u2019s acquisition of the S-400 is unacceptable,\u201d said acting Pentagon spokesman Charles Summers Jr. \u201cUntil they forgo delivery of the S-400, the United States has suspended deliveries and activities associated with the stand-up of Turkey\u2019s F-35 operational capability. Should Turkey procure the S-400, their continued participation in the F-35 program is at risk.\u201d Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition\nThe US move comes just days after Turkey\u2019s foreign minister said his country was committed to the deal to buy the Russian system and was discussing delivery dates.\nAmerican defense and military leaders have said that unless Turkey, a NATO ally, reconsidered its purchase of the S-400, it would forfeit other future American military aircraft and systems. The US and other NATO allies have repeatedly complained about the purchase, saying it is not compatible with other allied systems and would represent a threat to the F-35.\nDuring a Capitol Hill hearing last month, U.S. Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, the top NATO general, said his best military advice would be that the US not work with an ally that\u2019s acquiring Russian systems that can threaten one of the American military\u2019s most advanced capabilities. Officials have also expressed concerns that Turkey\u2019s acquisition of both US and Russian systems could give Moscow access to sophisticated American technology and allow it to find ways to counter the F-35.\nA F-35 bomber variant releasing a 500-pound bomb during a weapons test, in December 2012. (photo credit: US Navy/Lockheed Martin) Turkey had been a partner in the international consortium that financed the F-35 since 2002, and planned to purchase 100 of the stealth fighter jets from the US at a reported price of $1.2 billion.\nThe US had initially planned to deliver the two aircraft to Turkey in June.\nSummers said that although Washington continues to talk with Turkey about the matter, the Pentagon has begun taking necessary steps to find other sources of supply for the Turkish-produced parts of the F-35. The department, he said, is taking prudent steps to protect the supply chain and the shared investments in the aircraft technology.\nPentagon leaders have warned that ending Turkey\u2019s participation in production would likely force other allies to take on that role and could delay aircraft delivery.\nUS leaders have pressed Turkey to buy an American-made air defense battery, and in December the State Department approved the sale of a $3.5 billion US Patriot system to Ankara.\nTurkey\u2019s foreign minister said Friday his country was committed to buying the Russian missile defense system. Speaking at a joint news conference with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in the Mediterranean coastal city of Antalya, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu ruled out the possibility of Turkey selling the S-400s to another country as suggested by some analysts as a compromise solution.\nThe S-400 anti-aircraft missile system on display in Russia.

Korea, U.S. reaffirm commitment to support inter-Korean military accord\n(ATTN: TRIMS; RECASTS throughout)\nWASHINGTON/SEOUL, April 2 (Yonhap) -- The defense chiefs of South Korea and the United States have reaffirmed their commitment to closely coordinating to support last year's inter-Korean military accord aimed at reducing border tensions and building trust, their offices said.\nDuring their talks in Washington on Monday (local time), Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo and acting U.S. Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan also reiterated their will to closely cooperate to expedite the fulfillment of conditions needed for Washington's envisioned transfer of wartime operational control (OPCON) to Seoul.\nJeong and Shanahan met face to face for the first time since the latter took the Pentagon post in January.\n\"The secretary and the minister assessed that implementation of the Comprehensive Military Agreement (CMA) has contributed to the easing of military tension and confidence building on the Korean Peninsula,\" Seoul's defense ministry and the Pentagon said in a press release.\nThe Koreas' defense chiefs signed the CMA at the close of the third summit between President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang last September. It entails a series of trust-building and arms control measures under a broader scheme to halt all hostile acts against each other.\nJeong and Shanahan underscored their will to further reinforce the alliance through the \"synchronized\" efforts of their militaries amid ongoing peace efforts with North Korea.\n\"The secretary and minister affirmed that the U.S.-ROK alliance is 'ironclad' and ready to face an evolving security environment,\" the press release reads. ROK stands for South Korea's official name, the Republic of Korea.\n\"The two sides reaffirmed the commitment to maintain an unwavering combined readiness posture while continuing to support the ongoing diplomatic efforts to achieve complete denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula,\" it added.\nGen. Robert Abrams, the commander of the South Korea-U.S. Combined Forces Command, gave the defense chiefs an evaluation of the allies' new exercise staged last month. He said that it has strengthened the militaries' combined readiness and contributed to the groundwork for the OPCON transfer.\nAbrams was referring to the Dong Maeng command post exercise that replaced the Key Resolve exercise. Dong Maeng is the Korean word for alliance.\nCritics discounted the new exercise as a downsized version of the Key Resolve, raising concerns that it could undermine the allies' defense posture. But Shanahan disagreed.\n\"I don't think we're scaling back exercises. I think we're building capability up,\" the acting secretary said.\nHe added that the allies learned \"lessons\" from the new exercise and will look to apply them to future drills.\n\"We want to make sure that there are no gaps or seams, and that we continue to build on these exercises,\" he said. \"We're going to talk about the September exercises and the lessons learned from these ones in March.\"\nJeong said that the March drills concluded \"successfully\" and added that it served as a \"useful\" opportunity to confirm the allies' defense posture.\nThe two sides also agreed to work toward initial operational capability (IOC) certification of a South Korea-led combined defense posture later this year, and committed to stay in close consultation, the press release said.\nSeoul and Washington have been pushing for the conditions-based OPCON transfer after which the former will lead wartime operations with the latter playing a supporting role.\nFollowing the IOC certification slated for this summer, the two sides are expected to verify Seoul's full operational and mission capabilities in the following years.\nThis photo shows South Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo (L) meeting with acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan (R) at the Pentagon, near Washington, on April 1, 2019.

The nine partner nations that participated in the plane's development include the US, Turkey, UK, Italy, Netherlands, Canada, Australia, Denmark and Norway. All of these countries except for Canada, Denmark and Turkey are already receiving deliveries of the F-35. Israel, Japan and South Korea also have received the jets through foreign military sales.\nA US defense official previously told CNN that a major concern is that the S-400, particularly if it's plugged into Turkey's integrated air defense system, could gather technical data on the F-35's capabilities and that critical information could be passed to Moscow either intentionally or unintentionally through a back door in the Russian-designed system.\n\"This issue, the S-400, is a tough issue. And we're having a hard time,\" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford said last month at an event at the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC.\n\"I think both the executive branch of our government, the legislative branch of our government are going to have a hard time reconciling the presence of the S-400 and the most advanced fighter aircraft that we have, the F-35,\" he said, adding \"our position has been made very clear to Turkey.\"\n\"We're hopeful that we can find a way through this. But it's a tough issue,\" Dunford said.

Yet Bin Salman as well as the coordinator of the operation, Saud al-Qahtani, have enjoyed freedom from repercussions.\nLast October, Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where he was subsequently killed. After offering a series of changing narratives to explain what happened, the Saudi government eventually admitted he had died there but blamed the operation on a botched rendition attempt.\n\"Now, half a year after this heinous act shocked the world, it is worth taking stock of what has been done in response \u2014 and what has not,\" The Post wrote.\n\"Mohammed bin Salman has jetted around the world, high-fiving Russian President Vladimir Putin, getting chummy with China, and rubbing elbows with other world leaders as part of a global tour to rehabilitate his reputation,\" it said.\nThe newspaper, however, applauded efforts by the international community to condemn the murder and call for action to be taken. Some 36 countries had united at the UN Human Rights Council to condemn the killing and call on the Saudis to cooperate with the investigation being conducted by the UN.\nCongress also offered its own rebuke, passing a resolution to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition's war in Yemen and repeatedly investigated and criticized Washington's response to the murder.\nMeanwhile, Trump has taken a far different approach, according to The Post. The president has shied away from criticizing the crown prince and taking any further action against the kingdom other than placing sanctions on the 17 individuals the Saudi government has said were responsible for the act.\n\"In this impotent response, Trump isn\u2019t just violating the law. He is also undermining the credibility and moral authority of the United States,\" the newspaper wrote.\n\"Another six months cannot pass without accountability for this abhorrent crime. Justice for an innocent journalist \u2014 and America\u2019s most crucial interests \u2014 require nothing less,\u201d it added.

He started a business with his wife to develop a web-based, software-as-a-service product. As the business began to grow, his belief in it increased, and he started to take it more seriously. One of the things he did next was to start planning and monitoring progress. To do that, he started setting deadlines. But soon \u201cmissing deadlines\u201d created an enormous amount of stress for both him and his wife, and for the other people they were working with. \u201cIt\u2019s just not worth it,\u201d he told me, and he backed-off from the deadlines. Before he and I talked about this topic, my friend had been thinking that he needed to figure out how to use deadlines, to discover how to \u201cmake them work.\u201d After our conversation, and once he had digested the conclusions we had come to, he told me by text message that \u201cdeadlines simply don\u2019t work at all.\u201d Now he plans to print a massive sign that reads NO DEADLINES and stick it on the wall of his business. In this article I\u2019m going to explain to you what deadlines really are, why they are not effective, and what the alternative is. Actually it\u2019s not really an alternative because what we want is a way to achieve world-class creativity and productivity, not simply an alternative way to thwart it, which is what deadlines do. But first we need to take a look at what work is and what motivates humans to do it. In any endeavor, progress is made through the completion of a sequence of small actions, actions ultimately instigated by humans. Any completed project is constructed from a framework of these actions, stacked on top of each other, constructing a solution that is far more valuable than the sum of the values of each of those small actions considered individually. Even though many operations can now be automated, progress is still dependent on a creative agent initiating, monitoring, fixing, and checking the results of many automated processes. Even as increasingly sophisticated machine intelligences automate aspects of work that were historically performed by humans, we must still be the ultimate initiators of those processes. Until we have perfect slave intelligences, work will essentially be completed only at the whim of meaty animals containing large neocortices whose actions are strongly influenced by ancient reptilian and mammalian brain structures that are vastly more interested in eating things that move and fucking things that breathe than on manipulating the numbers in an Excel spreadsheet. By the way, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever have artificial general intelligences (AGIs) that can replace humans without treating those AGIs as autonomous beings (and paying them). As I wrote in Why The Terminator Doesn\u2019t Bitch About Money, and Why You Shouldn\u2019t Either \u00b9 (link at end), I believe that intelligence in any form is synonymous with freedom. So how do we get people to do things? Well, countless psychologists have studied this topic and the results are pretty conclusive; and they seem to be intuitively correct in hindsight. As individual workers, people need (1) to have autonomy, (2) to feel that they are on a path to some kind of mastery, and (3) to also find meaning in their work. This is explained extremely well in a book called Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us \u00b2. These three factors are the bedrock of motivation, and I believe that as we create machine intelligences that meet and exceed the capabilities of humans, our ability to provide these environmental factors to our super-intelligent robot progeny will be crucial. But people don\u2019t operate on their own. We curate teams of people with diverse skills and perspectives, creating many-brained flesh organisms that can achieve outcomes that a single biped couldn\u2019t. We also have hierarchies of people, as represented by org charts, that capture increasingly broad domains of responsibility and authority. So how do we get people to do things in a group context? Well, the scientific evidence is pretty clear on this too. First of all, we don\u2019t hire assholes. If we do accidentally hire an asshole, we identify and fire them as rapidly as possible. Finally, if by some stroke of very bad luck an asshole does stick around, then no matter how \u201cbrilliant\u201d we might think they are, we certainly don\u2019t promote them up the leadership chain. What is an asshole though? In this context, it\u2019s basically a narcissist, someone who consistently puts their own personal, short-sighted needs in front of the other humans around them and in front of the best interests of the organizations that they are a part of, which includes the employer that pays their salary or wage. When I write about narcissists below, I\u2019m referring to people with various shades of narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) or similar clusters of change-resistant personality features. Some people exhibit features of NPD without being diagnosable, a state which is referred to as \u201csub-clinical;\u201d those features are still usually very destructive to relationships. The American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) lists the following symptoms: Grandiosity with expectations of superior treatment from other people Fixation on fantasies of power, success, intelligence, attractiveness, etc. Self-perception of being unique, superior, and associated with high-status people and institutions Need for continual admiration from others Sense of entitlement to special treatment and to obedience from others Exploitation of others to achieve personal gain Unwillingness to empathize with the feelings, wishes, and needs of other people Intense envy of others, and the belief that others are equally envious of them Pompous and arrogant demeanor People with NPD usually exhibit at least some of these symptoms in a way that is out-of-whack with their real-life qualities or accomplishments. Of course, it\u2019s important not to read this list and start diagnosing yourself or others, but it\u2019s good to be aware of this list in order to recognize when these kinds of behaviors seem to be appearing. There are many other terms related to NPD that come from different psychological schools attempting to categorize the phenomenon, such as malignant narcissist, oblivious narcissist, and covert narcissist, all of which hopefully speak for themselves. All personality disorders are essentially characterized as being ego-syntonic, which means that the person with the disorder consistently perceives their dysfunctional behaviors as normal and acceptable, even if they also attempt to hide them from selected others (such as those with immediate power over them). This characteristic of personality disorders, especially NPD, make them very resistant to treatment. NPD is particularly heavily armored against change because the idea of needing to change is in itself an affront to the narcissist. The narcissist believes that everyone else needs to change, but not them. Narcissists are highly effective at self-sabotage in the long-run simply because they cannot understand that what\u2019s best for the group is usually also what\u2019s best for themselves. Doing what\u2019s best for the company is obviously the most effective long-term path to career success to someone who can peer just a little bit past their own fear, jealousy, anger, righteousness, and greed. The only kind of employee you need to instruct to \u201cdo what\u2019s right for the company\u201d is either severely disempowered (probably by a narcissist) or is a narcissist themselves. By definition, the narcissist will never do what\u2019s right for the company unless it happens to coincide with their own short-sighted and selfish desires. The solution in either case is to locate the narcissist and terminate their employment. And it\u2019s pretty easy to root-out narcissists in an organization. For the individual contributor, a thorough review by peers is sufficient. Since NPD is characterized by dysfunctional relationships, the working peers of a narcissist will usually be able to convey the experience of chronic demoralization, upset, and manipulation that they have experienced at the hands of the narcissist. They usually want to get away from the narcissist, and often do so by leaving the company. This can result in great cost to both the company and the victim. I believe that this is partly the explanation for the somewhat surprising discovery by Google that the most significant predictor for the effectiveness of an employee is the quality of their personal relationships outside of work. Larry Page, one of the two founders of Google, told this to a friend of mine. Narcissistic leaders (including managers and supervisors) may be even easier to root out: all you have to do is ask the people they lead. The \u201clower\u201d part of what is often considered to be a cumbersome 360-degree review process is usually enough. Since the role of a leader is primarily to lead, all you need to do is asses the effect they have on the people they lead, those directly \u201cbelow\u201d them in the organization. These are the people who are more likely to actually be getting work done, the people who are closer to the reality of the technology, the market, and the customers. They are one step closer to where the rubber meets the road. If you can get these people to talk about it, which can be challenging, the strongest indicator that they may reveal is fear. Those led by a narcissist are often terrified of the narcissist, of their manipulation and of their narcissistic rage. Later in this article, I will tell you about the hallmarks of effective leadership; with the narcissistic leader, those characteristics will be wholly absent. It\u2019s important to understand that narcissists are usually very skillful at managing up; they\u2019re often really good at kissing ass. So those \u201cabove\u201d them in the organization often perceive them as compliant and pleasant and their organizations as effective. Since it\u2019s almost impossible to create organizations with control groups, the narcissistic leader\u2019s own leader has no effective way of personally assessing how much performance is being left on the table due to those being led by the narcissist feeling terrified and demoralized. Simply assessing leaders primarily on the effect they have on the people they lead is very likely to produce a massive increase in their effectiveness as leaders, which will have an enormously leveraged effect on the effectiveness of the organization as a whole. Even if you\u2019re not trying to root-out narcissists, the important and effective assessment of leadership will naturally do the job for you. For the non-narcissists, perhaps for those existing gingerly on the autistic spectrum, an effective feedback loop will likely lead to an increase in critical learnable personal characteristics such as social and emotional intelligence. And it\u2019s not even necessary to have a formal, cumbersome, and likely ineffective review process. At the company where I work, I regularly meet with people at all levels of seniority. From having hundreds of candid conversations with those who are led by others, I have a very clear picture of the relative strengths and opportunities-for-growth of many of the leaders across the company. If you want to read more about assholes, I recommend an awesome series of articles titled Your Company Culture Is Who You Hire, Fire, and Promote \u00b3. Before I go on to talk about effective leadership, I want to point out that, for a \u201cgood-enough\u201d leader, it takes an enormous amount of courage to be willing to even discover and acknowledge the level of dysfunction about which I\u2019ve written above. It then takes even more courage to confront it. It can be really scary to confront narcissists, because most people can sense the rage hidden just under the surface. It also takes courage to transition people out of an organization. What\u2019s more, if your company culture is conflict-avoidant, and therefore probably filled with conflict-avoidant leaders, then it\u2019s susceptible to infiltration by narcissists, and eventually infestation with them. In these kinds of organizations, red flags will be ignored, minimized, and rationalized away. One way that narcissists flourish is when a leader claims that \u201che\u2019s a top-performer, so there\u2019s nothing I can do\u201d. It doesn\u2019t matter how much of a rockstar, key player, or top contributor you think the narcissist is, you can be guaranteed that they have a net negative effect on the organization, and ignoring their behavior will not make it go away. For every unit of goodness that they apparently add, they will subtract at least two from those around them, and probably much more. In fact, this is one of the ways they get to shine: by puffing themselves up while tearing down their peers or reports. Narcissistic leaders also take credit for the work of those they lead while at the same time dismissing their contributions. As each new discovery is made, it is immediately assimilated into the knowledge-base of the narcissist, as if it magically appeared in their brain overnight. There\u2019s no need to recognize the effort of the folks who are actually doing the work because the narcissistic leader apparently already knew the results that were painstakingly obtained. Initially, this can be confusing to employees because the leader seemed to have asked for work do be done unnecessarily. From the perspective of a narcissist, the purpose of those reporting to them is only to make them look better, to serve their narcissistic needs. This is one example of what I mean by short-sighted selfishness. The narcissist is usually so lacking in empathy and self-awareness, so consumed by the deep psychological processes driving the narcissism, that they don\u2019t even realize that their behavior will undermine their ability to achieve their personal goals in the longer term. Talented people learn to hide their innovations or to reduce their creativity or productivity, or they simply leave the company. This is anti-leadership. So you can also bet that one unit of goodness you think the narcissist is adding is in fact only a fraction of a unit. As the results of Google\u2019s Project Aristotle \u2074 show, \u201cwhat makes a team effective at Google\u201d is a set of characteristics that simply don\u2019t mesh with narcissism: psychological safety, dependability, structure & clarity, meaning, and impact. The narcissistic employee might be reasonably effective working alone on a small project that doesn\u2019t involve interacting with other people, and that might be an alternative to firing them, so long as you can keep them quarantined; good luck with that. The long-term costs of the kind of draining and insidiously manipulative behavior that these narcissists act-out are almost incalculable in their scope and depth. As an organization, how do you even account for the bad karma of inflicting psychological torture on innocent people who simply want to come to work, do a great job, and feed their families? As a leadership consultant, the witnessing of this stuff has led to me feeling like I needed to literally vomit from disgust. I myself know what it\u2019s like to fire people: as a manager, I have let people go. In fact, whereas it was normal for firing to be done by people at the senior vice president level (my manager), I insisted on doing it myself. \u201cIt\u2019s my decision, so I\u2019ll do it\u201d I said. And yet, as an empath, being the instrument of that much distress in someone else\u2019s life wore me down. As I\u2019ve matured, I\u2019ve come to believe that pretty much any employee, with the exception of a narcissist, can be made productive. The trick to avoid having to fire these people is to simply not hire them in the first place. This is why, even though I\u2019m a senior engineer, when interviewing candidates I\u2019m focussed wholly on assessing their personality. I\u2019m able to do this relatively effectively because I have a Ph.D. in clinical psychology. I also have a lot of personal experience with narcissists. So then what does good leadership look like? The research shows that the most important leadership behaviors are those that nurture increased employee engagement. \u201cEngagement\u201d in this context is part of a very specific psychological term; it doesn\u2019t mean \u201chappiness.\u201d According to Wikipedia, employee engagement is \u201ca fundamental concept in the effort to understand and describe, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the nature of the relationship between an organization and its employees.\u201d Therefore, any leader\u2019s primary objective is the curation of that relationship. Wikipedia\u2019s excellent definition continues: An \u201cengaged employee\u201d is defined as one who is fully absorbed by and enthusiastic about their work and so takes positive action to further the organization\u2019s reputation and interests. An engaged employee has a positive attitude towards the organization and its values. In contrast, a disengaged employee may range from someone doing the bare minimum at work (aka \u2018coasting\u2019), up to an employee who is actively damaging the company\u2019s work output and reputation. Towers Watson conducted a thorough and high-quality study on turbocharging employee engagement through the power of recognition from managers \u2075. In alignment with the prevailing consensus, they found that companies with high employee engagement produced significantly higher returns to shareholders than average companies. This study also concluded that employee engagement is driven by the quality of the relationship between supervisors and those they immediately supervise, which is characterized by the level of: Inclusiveness : My immediate supervisor understands and assesses my contributions fairly. Communication : My immediate supervisor communicates openly with me and encourages me to make suggestions, which she takes seriously. Trust : I trust my immediate supervisor, and she trusts my judgement. I highly recommend reading the full, two-part study. It\u2019s eye-opening and applicable to boosting the bottom-line of any organization. With all of this information, we now understand where individual motivation comes from in the context of the work itself and in the context of the most important relationship at work, the relationship between the supervisor and each of the people she supervises. This article is intended to be about deadlines, but I felt that it was necessary to clearly define both work and human motivation in the context of work before getting to deadlines themselves. This is because deadlines, in our common understanding, are related to people doing work. There\u2019s also no point in rearranging the deckchairs on the titanic if you\u2019re either not steering around the iceberg or patching the rip in the hull. Do the hard part, fix the motivation issues, and you\u2019ll have done 95% of the work. So what are deadlines? A deadline usually specifies that some measurable outcome will be achieved by a particular date. Without thinking about them too deeply, it\u2019s usually assumed that they\u2019re a way of making a chosen outcome happen by that date. However, when considered more deeply, they can be seen as a way of trying to control human resources. A deadline says, \u201cthis is a commitment to provide a very clearly defined set of deliverables by a specific date,\u201d a form of contract. When used in the relationship between a manager and the person he manages, deadlines, being so transactional, tend to rapidly erode all of the qualities that lead to intrinsic motivation. Unless work is purely mechanical, it involves creativity and requires inspiration, ideally prolonged states of flow. With a sufficient supply of autonomy, mastery, and meaning in an interpersonal context of inclusiveness, communication, and trust, an individual contributor will perform optimally in complex and creative tasks by staying in flow. By the way, any tasks that do not require creativity should be automated-away, applying skill to be rid of drudgery; this should be prioritized. The primary goal of an effective leader is to ensure that the people they lead remain in flow as much as possible. Deadlines create an artificial constraint that distracts from the true motivation factors, reducing flow, and thereby leading to sub-optimal outcomes in the long-run. For most of my engineering career, I have enjoyed profound autonomy, and been prolific, while experiencing almost no interference from managers attempting to control my output. I have also been minimally impacted by deadlines. One personal datapoint that enables me to more deeply empathize with those being anti-managed was a short period of being really badly managed. I was reporting to a new manager who seemed to have read a book on management and then decided to do exactly the opposite of everything that was recommended. After I informed him that his daily check-ins were distracting, he switched to setting micro-deadlines for me. After this manager had left me alone for two weeks with one of these micro-deadlines, we met and I explained to him how much more progress I had been able to make without his interference. He told me that he didn\u2019t agree, because I had apparently not precisely met the arbitrary micro-deadline that he had set for me. If he had been listening to what I told him, he would have understood that, without the distraction of his continual interference, I had achieved far more than his micro-deadline demanded. As always happens with deadlines, the complexity of the unfolding process revealed much more about what needed to be done than could have been anticipated at the beginning, even by me let alone by him. It didn\u2019t seem to matter to him that I had proactively focused on the most important work during that two week period. What seemed to matter to him was that I had not continued to mechanically focus on the less important work demanded by his deadline. To him, being in control seemed to be more important that the quality, quantity, and relevance of the outcome. I then happened to complete that micro-deadline a day or two later than planned simply because the reality of the work happened to take a day or two longer than he had originally estimated. His response to my claim that I worked more effectively, and with much less stress, when he backed-off a little on the micro-management was that, \u201cI don\u2019t see the data for that,\u201d apparently having no clue that the words coming out of my mouth were the most valuable data he could ever receive. The increase in my productivity and the decrease in my stress during those two weeks was due solely to him leaving me alone. Obviously a micro-deadline was just another manifestation of the worst-form of micro-management. Even though he didn\u2019t seem to be interested in gathering the data from me, I tried to convey to him the effect that the micro-deadline had had on me. I remember as the two weeks unfolded that I discovered more details about specifically what needed to be done and the optimal sequence of tasks. As I executed spontaneous micro-pivots, my work, guided by my initiative and autonomy, began to diverge from what he specified in the micro-deadline. I was increasingly focusing on more important tasks that fed into the meta-outcome, tasks that would lead to it being achieved sooner and with higher quality. As the divergence between the reality of the work and his arbitrarily and artificially-generated micro-deadline increased, it caused mounting stress for me. I both had to serve the best interests of the company, driven by my internal leadership, and satisfy the pointless and arbitrary specifications of my \u201cmanager.\u201d The micro-deadline did nothing but zap my energy, focus, and enthusiasm, and detract from the good work I was doing in spite of his micro-management. This kind of micro-management might be somewhat effective if you were managing people doing repetitive and non-creative tasks, such as assembling widgets on a production line, jobs that can be, and very rapidly will be, automated-away. This is management which looks like operating a machine, but a machine with human parts. Of course, it\u2019s the kind of management style that would appeal to an unreflective engineer who is used to having total control of his computer, and who is not interested in learning new skills. This was clearly a low-inclusivity, low-communication, and low-trust relationship, in spite of my repeated attempts to address and fix the issues, to manage up. As a high-performing employee, I found it deeply disturbing that someone who was being paid to supposedly support me was actually doing everything in his power to thwart the only thing I wanted to do, which was to deliver maximum value for the company. After trying to get on the same page with him multiple times, and after discovering that he was resolutely unwilling to change, I left. I was simply not willing to continue allowing him to manage me at the expense of my sanity and the success of the company. I loved what I had been working on, and I loved my team. It was a great loss to both me and to the company. The experience had been like living inside a room with half-mirrored glass walls. I could see and hear him, but he could not apparently see or hear me. He barked commands at me over an intercom but had no idea what I was actually doing. Nevertheless, he seemed to be vaguely dissatisfied with his own manufactured stories about what I was doing, while also being in control of my air and food supplies: my employment, my salary, my stock grants, and my promotion prospects. Other quality engineers from that group either left or were somehow able to remain in spite of naturally under-performing while suffering in varying states of dissatisfaction and resentment. Putting my leadership consultant hat on for a moment: in situations like this, I would strongly recommend immediately removing a person like this from management. He didn\u2019t even seem to want to be a manager. He was not interested in people, not interested in their experiences, and not interested in learning about how to lead people effectively. Perhaps he liked the fantasy of power and authority or increased influence that management might bring. Those are not good reasons to become a manager because they are only potential side-effects; they are not the purpose of management. For someone with my depth of psychological understanding, it\u2019s astounding that nothing was done about a situation like that; he was even given more people to manage! Perhaps there was no leader willing to step up and make the difficult choice. This is another unglamorous aspect of effective leadership: you have to make very hard and often unpopular decisions. Perhaps there was fear of him leaving, even though it would represent a net gain for the company, and a net loss for whatever company received him. It\u2019s also possible that he might have been a relatively good engineer, although I was never able to determine this because he seemed to always carefully conceal the edges of his knowledge and skills, preventing me from ever being able to assess him properly. It\u2019s possible that he could have been an effective individual contributor. As well as increasing my empathy for the badly-managed, this experience also gave me insight into what often drives leaders to set deadlines: fear. Emotionally immature and inexperienced leaders, when given the responsibility for the quality and quantity of output from a team, will go straight to their default strategy, which is to try to get immediate control. The deadline is a tool that seems to provide control, but all it actually does is reduce the leader\u2019s anxiety temporarily at the expense of reducing all of the productivity-enhancing human factors in the longer-term. It basically transfers anxiety from the leader to those they lead. Even though it thwarts the goals of the organization, it feels good in-the-moment for the manager to work with deadlines. But with humans, the more you try to control them the less control you actually have. When we try to control people, they become less motivated, less inspired, and less innovative; they do the bare minimum work or they just leave. So one of the key skills of a leader is self-awareness, to become aware of their own anxiety and to learn to \u201chold it\u201d and to not act it out by taking immediately gratifying yet self-defeating actions, actions such as requesting, or even setting, deadlines. A leader is effective to the degree that they can resist passing their anxiety to the people they lead. Learning to lead can be particularly challenging for individual contributors because they are often familiar with managing mechanized processes over which they have almost perfect direct control. In contrast, leadership of humans is like gardening. You plant the seeds and you provide the water, the sun, and the food. The plant itself is the only part of the whole system that can do the actual growing. Giant oak trees grow from acorns, but nobody makes that happen; the acorn does the growing all by itself, but only if the conditions are right. Ineffective leadership looks like a gardener pulling on the little shoots, ripping them up by the roots in an attempt to make them grow taller. But what we call \u201cdeadlines\u201d do actually have some utility. They are a form of contract that can enable multiple organizations to synchronize their efforts, organizations that might be in the same company or in different companies. When you know when my team will deliver product X then you can plan for your delivery of product Y that depends on it. All of this enables the appropriate acquisition and deployment of resources, and it sets expectations for customers. These agreements can be powerful tools if they are used to help people and organizations, but they can easily become inadvertent weapons that harm people and organizations. Let\u2019s extract the goodness from them. Luckily, the agile software movement has already done this work for us. The book Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time \u2076describes an agile contract in which, for a specified price, a particular number of units of goodness will be delivered to a customer by a given date. This enables the development team and the customer to continually adapt to the unfolding technical discoveries of the project, and to the changing desires of the customer; the desires of the customer, whether that\u2019s your own marketing department or another company, will change as the increasingly high-fidelity renditions of the final product are exposed by the scrum process. The result is the delivery of the most relevant, complete, and highest-quality product available in the shortest amount of time and for lowest cost. When we have a team of humans creating an artifact, we can obviously utilize the motivation tools I describe above. We then need a way for the people to adaptively choose what to work on so that each thing they do maximally increases the value of the product. This is achieved by the scrum methodology of continually organizing tasks in the \u201cbacklog\u201d column and then allowing individuals to receive the rewarding satisfaction of taking these clearly important items into the \u201cdoing\u201d column before then retiring them to the \u201cdone\u201d column. None of this is based on deadlines. Work takes as long as it takes, and we do everything we can to make sure that the work that is being done is prioritized effectively and that those doing the work are maximally motivated. It\u2019s motivating to know that you\u2019re all working together to add features and improvements to the product that you\u2019ve decided are the highest value to the customer. It\u2019s motivating to know that you are empowered, as a team, to continually pivot, to adjust priorities, and to optimize your ability to maximize customer value. This is in stark contract with old-fashioned waterfall models of development with fixed deadlines and milestones, where the reality of product development is stifled by being shoe-horned into an almost universally ill-conceived up-front plan. I\u2019ve worked on many projects in which engineers soldiered on, somehow mustering creativity and productivity in the face of depressing slipping deadlines and unavoidable disparities between what was being built and what had originally been specified. The beauty of scrum is that very early on you have a deliverable product, what is often called a minimum viable product (MVP). Then each piece of work improves that product a little bit. This enables the team to stop at any point and ship the product in the best state it\u2019s ever been in. Some teams using agile development, such as the people making the Facebook mobile app, have a regular release cadence, say one a month, at which point they snap and release a finalized collection of changes. This means that \u201cthe train leaves the station\u201d at regular intervals, but it\u2019s not completely decided up-front what exactly will be on that train. The engineers can then focus on adding value to the product knowing that the value will be shipped when it\u2019s ready, which will be very soon. Features are added with hidden on/off switches, so that they can be integrated into the product that will be shipped but switched off at the last moment if a problem is found in final integration testing. They can then hopefully go into the next release. Agile contracts, whether negotiated one-off project contracts, or regular-cadence release schedules, extract the value of deadlines but leave behind the toxicity. They enable a renegotiable agreement to be made, an agreement that can account for the unpredictable and unfolding reality that is always a part of creative and innovative work. Agile contracts not only eliminate the motivation-squashing aspects of deadlines, they also amplify the motivation-enhancing human factors such as autonomy, mastery, and meaning.

Power has been intermittent since another blackout on March 25, and growing water shortages have aggravated the sense of crisis in a country where food and medicine are already scarce with an economy racked by hyperinflation.\nDemonstrators took to the streets throughout Caracas on Sunday and Monday, with small groups of people blocking roads to demand water. On Sunday night, police fired gunshots after some residents in Caracas set up burning barricades, according to Reuters witnesses.\nGuaido, the leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly who in January invoked the country's constitution to assume an interim presidency in a challenge to Maduro's legitimacy, said it was \"very clear that this regime has no solution to the crisis.\"\n\"Every time the power goes out, or we do not have water, or we do not have gas, guess what we are going to do?\" he said at an earlier rally at the country's Catholic University. \"We are going to protest, we are going to make demands, we are going to take to the streets of Venezuela, because it is our right.\"\nGuaido has been recognized by most Western and South American countries as the OPEC nation's rightful leader on the grounds that Maduro's May 2018 re-election was illegitimate.\nPower outages over the weekend prompted Venezuela's main oil terminal, Jose, to halt operations including crude exports, the lifeblood of the country's economy. It was the third time in a month that the port, which only restarted applications last Friday following last Monday's blackout, had stopped operations due to lack of electricity.\nGUAIDO AND IMMUNITY\nBlackouts and water shortages have long been common in Venezuela, especially in the interior. But the outages in March were more frequent, more widespread and longer-lasting than previous incidents, particularly in the capital. They have prompted the government to shorten the workday and cancel classes, though Maduro said school would resume on Wednesday.\nMaduro, a socialist who calls Guaido a puppet of the United States, has blamed the blackouts on \"attacks\" by the U.S. government and the domestic opposition on the country's main hydroelectric facility. He has said Guaido should \"face justice,\" but has not openly called for his arrest.\nThe pro-government Supreme Court on Monday reiterated a previous measure blocking Guaido from leaving the country, a measure which he openly violated in February.\nIt added that the Constituent Assembly, an all-powerful legislature controlled by the Socialist Party, should discuss the issue of whether or not to strip Guaido of parliamentary immunity - a move that could pave the way for his being jailed.\nBut state institutions loyal to the Socialist Party appear reluctant to act against Guaido, given his strong public backing and international pressure not to detain him.\nThe chief prosecutor's office has opened an investigation of Guaido, but has not ordered his arrest or officially charged him with anything.\nMaduro has not given details on his electricity load administration plan, which Venezuelans on social media interpreted as a program of power rationing.\nMaduro's critics reject his contention that the blackouts have been caused by attacks. Local electrical engineers consulted by Reuters said the years of underinvestment and lack of maintenance of the country's electrical infrastructure have contributed to the outages.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://api.trkd.thomsonreuters.com/api/topnews/topnews-images/2019-04-01T144315Z_1_JF3_RTRLXPP_2_LYNXPACKAGER.JPG.ashx"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "maduro", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shaylim valderrama", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vivian sequera", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "juan guaido", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "igor gavidia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luis motta", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nasdaq.com reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "electrificacion del caroni", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caracas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caracas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T04:45:50.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "241f4dc632844126bde60f3978da55f3df49c638", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/01/white-house-security-clearance-denials-overturned-trump-whistleblower", "site_full": "www.theguardian.com", "site": "theguardian.com", "site_section": "https://www.theguardian.com/international", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "News, sport and opinion from the Guardian's global edition | The Guardian", "title": "Whistleblower: White House reversed dozens of security clearance denials | US news", "title_full": "Whistleblower: White House reversed dozens of security clearance denials | US news | The Guardian", "published": "2019-04-02T04:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0be3f017327f8c76328ac4736887f3ac8377274d/0_376_5635_3381/master/5635.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=2ae039533e469522d30a763503672731", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 170, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "241f4dc632844126bde60f3978da55f3df49c638", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/01/white-house-security-clearance-denials-overturned-trump-whistleblower", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sabrina Siddiqui", "published": "2019-04-02T04:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Whistleblower: White House reversed dozens of security clearance denials | US news", "text": "Veteran security adviser warns Trump administration ignored \u2018disqualifying issues\u2019 including foreign influence and conflict of interest.

Democrats in Congress have demanded more information on the security clearance process and delivered an ultimatum to the White House to comply or face a subpoena.\nThe documents do not identify the officials on the list but say they include \u201ctwo current senior White House officials, as well as contractors and individuals\u201d in different parts of the executive office of the president.\nDemocrats launch inquiry into White House's use of security clearances Read more\n\u201cI feel that right now this is my last hope to really bring the integrity back into our office,\u201d Newbold said, according to the memo.\n\u201cI want it known that this is a systematic \u2013 it\u2019s an office issue, and we\u2019re not a political office, but these decisions were being continuously overrode [sic].\u201d\nNewbold told lawmakers she maintained a list of White House officials whose clearance applications were initially denied, only for the decision to later be overturned.

The South Korean automakers have recalled more than 2.3 million vehicles since 2015 to address various engine fire risks.\nThe probe covers the 2011-2014 Kia Optima and Sorento; and 2010-2015 Kia Soul, along with the 2011-2014 Hyundai Sonata and Santa Fe.\nHyundai said in a statement it was cooperating and added it has been in \"frequent, open and transparent dialogue regarding non-collision engine fires.\"\nKia said it will continue to work with NHTSA and \"openly shares information and data with NHTSA on all matters pertaining to vehicle safety.\"\n NHTSA said the decision to initiate the probe was based on its analysis of information received from multiple manufacturers, consumer complaints and other sources.\nThe agency said prior Kia and Hyundai vehicle recalls covered by the probe are primarily related to engine fires the new probe \"is not limited to engine components and may cover additional vehicle systems or components.\"\nJason Levine, executive director of the Centre for Auto Safety, said it was \"long past time for the full power of the federal government to be brought to bear to answer why so many thousands of Kia and Hyundai vehicles have been involved in non-crash fires.\"\nHe added he hoped the probe will quickly lead to new recalls. \"The evidence is now clear - Hyundai and Kia should have acted to recall these vehicles far earlier,\" he said.\nLast month, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said a group of US states is investigating Hyundai and Kia for potential unfair and deceptive acts related to reports of hundreds of vehicle fires.\nIn November, Reuters reported federal prosecutors had launched a criminal investigation into Hyundai and Kia to determine if vehicle recalls linked to engine defects had been conducted properly.\nIn January, the automakers agreed to offer software upgrades for 3.7 million vehicles not being recalled.\nA South Korean whistleblower in 2016 reported concerns to NHTSA, which has been probing the timeliness of three US recalls and whether they covered enough vehicles.\nIn 2015, Hyundai recalled 470,000 US Sonata sedans, saying engine failure would result in a vehicle stall, increasing the risk of a crash. At the time, Kia did not recall its vehicles, which share the same \u201cTheta II\u201d engines.\nIn March 2017, Hyundai expanded its original US recall to 572,000 Sonata and Santa Fe Sport vehicles with those Theta II engines, citing the same issue involving manufacturing debris.\nOn the same day, Kia also recalled 618,000 Optima, Sorento and Sportage vehicles, all of which use the same engine.\nSource: Reuters", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "kia", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hyundai", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hyundai motor co", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhtsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kia motors corp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kia optima", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national highway traffic safety administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyundai sonata", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa fe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T04:48:50.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c241ec290298f1de41a7da547842f15a11cec466", "url": "https://www.kitco.com/news/video/show/Swiss-Mining-Institute-Conference/2356/2019-04-01/Why-Gold-Is-The-Only-Currency-You-Can-Rely-On", "site_full": "www.kitco.com", "site": "kitco.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Why Gold Is The \"Only Currency You Can Rely On\" - Kitco", "title_full": "Why Gold Is The \"Only Currency You Can Rely On\" - Kitco", "published": "2019-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://web.resource-kitco.com/video/image/thumbnail/19_03_27_Beget_SS.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7841, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c241ec290298f1de41a7da547842f15a11cec466", "url": "https://www.kitco.com/news/video/show/Swiss-Mining-Institute-Conference/2356/2019-04-01/Why-Gold-Is-The-Only-Currency-You-Can-Rely-On", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Gold Is The \"Only Currency You Can Rely On\" - Kitco", "text": "Apr 01, 2019 Guest(s): Claude Beget Keynote Speaker, Swiss Mining Institute\nLong-term, gold\u2019s reliability as a currency should drive its value up, says Claude Beget, keynote speaker of the Swiss Mining Institute. \u201cSince gold is now the only currency that you can rely on because the dollar is not good, there\u2019s too much debt, the euro is in a mess, the Japanese yen is nothing, so there is no currency left,\u201d Beget told Kitco News on the sidelines of the Swiss Mining Institute Conference in Geneva.

And after you sit down, a person you\u2019ve never met grabs one of those tools, brings it close to your face, and tells you to open your mouth as wide as you can. No, wider.\nFrom the point of view of a young child, or their parent, the dentist\u2019s office can be a scary and stressful place to visit for the first time. In some situations paediatric dental anxiety can be so serious that it creates a need for measures no one wants to take, from delaying care to sedation or even physical restraint. But experts say long-term dental health benefits greatly from going to the dentist at a young age.\nPaediatric dental anxiety is such a common problem that when the Paediatric Device Innovation Consortium (PDIC) at the University of Minnesota put out a public call for ideas on unmet medical needs in 2016, finding ways to ease kids\u2019 dental fears was the first idea to arrive in the inbox.\nBeginning on Monday, a new U spinout business called Yonder is launching an app designed to address this need by using a cartoon hippo named Mimi to help young patients get comfortable with the dentist\u2019s office, before they even arrive there. Yonder\u2019s first commercial client is Laganis Paediatric Dentistry in Maple Grove, and second client in Edina is expected to come online soon.\nThe Yonder app combines footage of the actual dentist\u2019s office that the child is going to visit and recordings of their dentist into an interactive virtual tour hosted by Mimi. The video plays on a parent\u2019s iOS or Android smartphone, after a notification for the app download arrives with an appointment-reminder text.\n\u201cHi! I\u2019m Mimi! Come to the dentist with me!\u201d the character says over upbeat kids music on a demo video on the Yonder website. The program waits for the two-year-old in the video to advance the program by pressing the screen.\nYonder\u2019s app for anxious young dental patients features Mimi the hippo giving a guided tour of the actual dentist\u2019s office where the child\u2019s appointment is scheduled.\n\u201cCome on in. Wave hello to my friend!\u201d Mimi says, as a clinician in the doctor\u2019s office waves back. The video is captured at a child\u2019s eye level, so the front desk looms large and doorknobs are at the centre of the screen. \u201cThere\u2019s so much to see here!\u201d Mimi says as the actual toys in the waiting room are displayed.\nThen the video follows the actual path the child will take through the office to the dental chair, where the common dental tools are displayed and described, before the dentist is shown, smiling and friendly.\n\u201cWe sit at the intersection of education and entertainment to drive better health outcomes,\u201d said Adam Choe, who co-founded Yonder with his U colleague Dr Courtney Hill. \u201cBy blending those two things together, we think we can have a perfect platform to help prepare kids for better health outcomes.\u201d\n\u201cDental health is a really good prognosticator of oral health,\u201d said Hill, a practicing paediatric head and neck surgeon. \u201cWe just want to make things better for the little ones coming into the dentist\u2019s office.\u201d\nDr Teresa Fong, a paediatric dentist with Metropolitan Paediatric Dental Associates, test-drove the app with a dozen of her patients. Every parent said it was helpful, she said, and the app did seem to allay many anxieties of young patients.\nThe most consistent thing she noticed was that each patient readily opened their mouth when the time came.\n\u201cThat was the most impactful thing I saw,\u201d Fong said. \u201cI would just say, \u2018Open up like Mimi\u2019 and their mouth would just drop open.\u201d\nMimi the hippo is the brainchild of many parents.\nIn 2016, the PDIC launched the Community Discovery Program for Child Health Innovation, which sought input from the public about unmet medical needs that the group could highlight to its stakeholders and collaborators. The suggestion to address paediatric dental anxiety was forwarded to the organisation at the U known today as the Earl E. Bakken Medical Devices Centre.\nHill and Choe were innovation fellows at the Bakken Center at the time, and they started working on it as a research project. The project gathered steam and eventually attracted seed funding \u2013 from the PDIC. That led to more work, followed by additional funding from the U-state partnership MnDrive, which stands for Minnesota\u2019s Discovery, Research and InnoVation Economy.\nAll told, just over US$75,000 (RM305,850) in funding poured in from various sources to develop the underlying technology. In late 2017, Choe and Hill\u2019s innovation was spun out of the university into a startup company formed by the U\u2019s Office for Technology Commercialisation, creating Yonder. Choe said Yonder received full ownership of its intellectual property for development work at the U in exchange for equity and a cash payment.\n\u201cThis is really a great example of a project that can start out as an unmet need, and then various groups at the University can collaborate to see it through all the way to an innovation and a startup company,\u201d said Jodi Fenlon Rebuffoni, senior program manager with PDIC, which is a part of the U\u2019s Clinical and Translational Science Institute. \u2013 The Minneapolis Star Tribune/Tribune News Service", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "paediatric device innovation consortium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T04:51:41.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "34884e57a1006762e6456e8e85b960cc64d3d59a", "url": "https://www.sportingnews.com/au/league/news/jarryd-hayne-nrl-parramatta-eels-us-rape-case/h7wz6k4yjq6u1mumdvnvz1ixy", "site_full": "www.sportingnews.com", "site": "sportingnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.sportingnews.com/au/rss", "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "Sporting News RSS", "title": "Jarryd Hayne reaches agreement with alleged US rape victim", "title_full": "Jarryd Hayne reaches agreement with alleged US rape victim", "published": "2019-04-02T03:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.performgroup.com/di/library/sportal_com_au/b1/3a/jarryd-hayne_vrb8yq6hx6b91ihvkdv8sox09.jpg?t=-1789786329&quality=100", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7208, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 135, "comments": 158, "shares": 25}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "34884e57a1006762e6456e8e85b960cc64d3d59a", "url": "https://www.sportingnews.com/au/league/news/jarryd-hayne-nrl-parramatta-eels-us-rape-case/h7wz6k4yjq6u1mumdvnvz1ixy", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Australia", "published": "2019-04-02T03:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "Jarryd Hayne reaches agreement with alleged US rape victim", "text": "Jarryd Hayne reaches agreement with alleged US rape victim Written By Sporting News Parramatta Eels Jarryd Hayne has won the right to give evidence in Australia for his US civil case after reaching an agreement with an American woman accusing him of rape. Hayne's rape accuser was challenging to fly the former Parramatta star to California to face her lawyers and put an end to the case, however News Corp reports Hayne will now be deposed in his home country. The woman, who goes by the alias JV, claims she was abstaining from sex until marriage until Hayne allegedly had interactions with her during his time in America with the San Francisco 49ers in 2015. MORE: Kieran Foran could be out for three months with ankle injury Police did not have enough evidence to prosecute Hayne but the victim is chasing monetary damages in civil court. She said Hayne forced himself on her when she was heavily intoxicated and she woke up in a \"pool of blood\" with \"significant vaginal pain.\" Hayne argues that JV \"consented to all actions that took place, including all actions she now claims were non-consensual'', in an earlier statement from his lawyer. The 31-year-old is also facing separate sexual assault allegations in Australia, accused of biting a woman in the Hunter Valley on the night of the 2018 NRL grand final. He was subsequently charged with aggravated sexual assault and inflicting actual bodily harm and was forced to pay a $20,000 surety after being granted bail. Hayne maintains his innocence in both cases and will return to court on April 3.

Help shape the future of investing tools and earn a $60 gift card! Today we'll evaluate Shreyans Industries Limited ( NSE:SHREYANIND ) to determine whether it could have potential as an investment idea. In particular, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that can give us insight into how profitably the company is able to employ capital in its business. First, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Next, we'll compare it to others in its industry. And finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities are impacting its ROCE. Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.' So, How Do We Calculate ROCE? The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) Or for Shreyans Industries: 0.30 = \u20b9677m \u00f7 (\u20b93.2b - \u20b9945m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2018.) So, Shreyans Industries has an ROCE of 30%. Check out our latest analysis for Shreyans Industries Does Shreyans Industries Have A Good ROCE? ROCE is commonly used for comparing the performance of similar businesses. In our analysis, Shreyans Industries's ROCE is meaningfully higher than the 16% average in the Forestry industry. We would consider this a positive, as it suggests it is using capital more effectively than other similar companies. Regardless of the industry comparison, in absolute terms, Shreyans Industries's ROCE currently appears to be excellent. As we can see, Shreyans Industries currently has an ROCE of 30% compared to its ROCE 3 years ago, which was 7.8%. This makes us think the business might be improving. More It is important to remember that ROCE shows past performance, and is not necessarily predictive. ROCE can be misleading for companies in cyclical industries, with returns looking impressive during the boom times, but very weak during the busts. ROCE is only a point-in-time measure. You can check if Shreyans Industries has cyclical profits by looking at this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow . Shreyans Industries's Current Liabilities And Their Impact On Its ROCE Liabilities, such as supplier bills and bank overdrafts, are referred to as current liabilities if they need to be paid within 12 months. The ROCE equation subtracts current liabilities from capital employed, so a company with a lot of current liabilities appears to have less capital employed, and a higher ROCE than otherwise. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets. Shreyans Industries has total liabilities of \u20b9945m and total assets of \u20b93.2b. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 30% of its total assets. The fairly low level of current liabilities won't have much impact on the already great ROCE. Our Take On Shreyans Industries's ROCE With low current liabilities and a high ROCE, Shreyans Industries could be worthy of further investigation.

outage delayed hundreds of flights and fired-up customer complaints on social media, the second such disruption in a week.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said the root of the problem was caused by the program provided by Scottsdale, Arizona-based AeroData Inc that helps airlines measure and manage weight and balance.\nAdvertisement The agency released a statement around 8.30 a.m. ET, saying the issue had been resolved and an FAA spokesman said it plans to look into the outage.\nAmerican Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines had reported outages. United Airlines said it was unable to create paperwork for some time.\n\"A brief third-party technology issue that prevented some Delta Connection flights from being dispatched on time this morning has been resolved,\" Delta said.\nOther airlines also reported a series of delays.\n Southwest Airlines was the first carrier to report that the problem had been resolved and it would get travelers moving soon, but added that customers could expect flight delays.\nA Southwest spokesman could not confirm how many flights were delayed, but said it was safe to say hundreds.\nFlightAware, an airline tracking website, said Southwest had delayed 775 flights, or 18 percent of its U.S. flights on Monday.\nAmerican Airlines, JetBlue Airways Corp, United Airlines and other carriers later said the technical issue had been resolved. JetBlue added it was still dealing with residual delays, while United said about 150 flights were delayed.\nLast week, several airlines had reported issues with Sabre Corp's flight reservation and booking system due to which passengers had difficulty accessing flight check-in systems.\nAERODATA GLITCH, PASSENGER STORM\nJust a few minutes of system downtime in AeroData can result in over 100 delayed flights and loss of revenue, according to a 2017 case study by VMware Inc.\nAeroData could not be immediately reached for comment.\nCustomers barraged Twitter with their complaints over confusion at airports and delayed flights.\nOne Southwest passenger reported waiting on the tarmac in a plane in Dallas for 90 minutes after his 6 a.m. flight to New Orleans was delayed.

Cresco stated that it will be the biggest acquisition of a public U.S. cannabis company ever.\nWith such a major deal, you might think that Origin House shareholders would be on cloud nine. However, that wasn't the case. Origin House shares dropped 5% in early trading on Monday. Why wasn't there more excitement over the acquisition? Here are three things you need to know about this transaction that promises to shake up the U.S. cannabis industry.\nImage source: Getty Images.\n1. Terms of less-than-endearment Probably the main reason Origin House shareholders weren't overly enthusiastic about the acquisition is the price tag. The deal values Origin House shares at 12.68 in Canadian dollars, or around $9.50. That's only a 5% premium over Origin House's closing price on Friday, March 29, 2019.\nOrigin House shareholders won't get any cash, either. Cresco Labs plans to acquire all outstanding shares of Origin House, with each Origin House shareholder receiving 0.8428 shares of Cresco Labs for each Origin House share owned.\nCresco Labs has been a solid winner, jumping 35% in 2018 and up 68% so far this year. But Origin House has been even hotter, soaring 59% last year and 85% year to date in 2019. It was even the No. 2 best-performing marijuana stock on the market in March . Some Origin House investors might think that they're getting ownership in a Corvette when they owned a stake in a Ferrari.\n2. The case for why the deal makes sense Size matters. If you're looking for the main reason why a combination of Cresco Labs and Origin House makes sense, that's it.\nCresco Labs is already one of the largest cannabis operators in the U.S. Cresco claims a 28% market share in Illinois and a 30% market share in Pennsylvania. It's awaiting licensure in Michigan and closing of an acquisition in Florida. Once these transactions are finalized, Cresco will have operations in 11 states, including 15 production facilities, 21 operational retail dispensaries, and licenses for another 30 retail dispensaries.\nOrigin House is the leading distributor of cannabis products in California, which has the largest legal marijuana market in the world. It has an expanding lineup of its own cannabis brands. The company is also poised to move into the Canadian recreational marijuana market in a major way with its acquisition of vape retailer 180 Smoke.\nCresco Labs thinks that its acquisition of Origin House will create a \"North American cannabis powerhouse.\" CEO Charlie Bachtell said that the deal will give Cresco \"the largest and most strategic distribution footprint of any cannabis company in the United States.\"\nOrigin House CEO Marc Lustig also sees a big advantage with the combination of the two companies. He stated, \"By partnering with one of the largest and most innovative U.S. multi-state operators in existence today, Origin House will supercharge its growth and be in a position to offer its brand partners access to 10 additional states, with licenses and supporting infrastructure already in place.\"\n3. What it means for investors going forward The deal isn't done just yet. Both companies' boards of directors have unanimously approved the transaction. Cresco Labs' shareholders don't have to vote on the acquisition. However, a meeting will likely be held in June for Origin House shareholders to vote. Two-thirds of shares must be voted in favor of the deal for it to close, in addition to the normal regulatory approvals.\nAssuming the transaction does successfully close, Origin House shareholders will own around 20% of Cresco Labs. The big question then will be: Now what? It could be smart for investors to hold on for the ride.\nCresco Labs projects pro forma combined revenue with Origin House in its fold this year of $383 million. By 2021, the company expects revenue of $1.04 billion and EBITDA of $317 million. And that's probably just the beginning.\nThe U.S. marijuana market is expected to grow dramatically over the next several years, with some projecting a market of $22 billion by 2022 . There's also a multibillion-dollar hemp opportunity thanks to the legalization of hemp in the U.S. in December 2018. In February, Cresco Labs launched a subsidiary to target the hemp cannabidiol (CBD) market.\nIf the acquisition of Origin House by Cresco Labs goes through, Cresco appears likely to become the sixth-largest cannabis operator by market cap. Although there seems to be some degree of disappointment for Origin House investors, the combined entity could be just what the two companies hope it will be -- a North American cannabis powerhouse.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cresco", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "biggest public us cannabis acquisition ever chicago-based cresco labs", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "getty images", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cresco labs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "origin house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T05:01:02.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "64ee58f671fb1cdb4002231000207d6c5efab18d", "url": "https://www.rte.ie/news/2019/0402/1040076-turkey_s400_f35/", "site_full": "www.rte.ie", "site": "rte.ie", "site_section": "http://www.rte.ie/rss/news.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "RT\u00c9 News - News Headlines", "title": "US halts F-35 deliveries to Turkey over Russian weapons", "title_full": "US halts F-35 deliveries to Turkey over Russian weapons", "published": "2019-04-02T04:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.rasset.ie/0011d8e9-1600.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4464, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 19, "comments": 4, "shares": 15}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "64ee58f671fb1cdb4002231000207d6c5efab18d", "url": "https://www.rte.ie/news/2019/0402/1040076-turkey_s400_f35/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T04:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "US halts F-35 deliveries to Turkey over Russian weapons", "text": "US halts F-35 deliveries to Turkey over Russian missile deal Updated / Tuesday, 2 Apr 2019 07:14 Turkey took delivery of its first F-35 last year\nThe US is halting all deliveries and joint work with Turkey on the F-35 fighter jet programme, after the NATO ally insisted on buying an anti-aircraft missile system from Russia.\nAfter months of warnings, the Pentagon said Turkey's decision to buy Russia's S-400 system was incompatible with remaining part of the US warplane programme.\n\"Pending an unequivocal Turkish decision to forgo delivery of the S-400, deliveries and activities associated with the stand-up of Turkey's F-35 operational capability have been suspended while our dialogue on this important matter continues with Turkey,\" the Pentagon said in a statement.\nUS officials have voiced concern that, with Turkey in both camps, Russia could obtain F-35 data to improve the accuracy of the S-400 to shoot down Western aircraft.\nThe Pentagon said that it had started to look at secondary sources to produce parts for F-35s that were being developed in Turkey.\n\"We very much regret the current situation facing our F-35 partnership, but the (Defence Department) is taking prudent steps to protect the shared investments made in our critical technology,\" the statement said.\nThe purchase of a Russian system is highly unusual for a member of NATO, the Western alliance forged to counter the Soviet Union.\nThe US suspension announcement comes two days before foreign ministers from the 29 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are due in Washington to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the alliance.\nLast week, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu met in Turkey with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, and insisted that the S-400 purchase would go ahead.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory\nA major disaster relief bill stalled on Monday in the U.S. Congress amid a political debate over aid for Puerto Rico, with President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans resisting Democrats\u2019 insistence the island receive additional assistance.\nThe Republican-controlled Senate took two procedural votes on Monday that both failed. The first was on a Republican bill offering $13.5 billion in disaster relief for states that included $600 million in nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico.\nThe second was on a $14.2 billion bill, with additional assistance for the U.S. island territory, passed by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives in January, before severe flooding hit the U.S. Midwest.\nThe failure of both bills sends lawmakers back to the negotiating table as the Trump administration\u2019s response to Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in September 2017, receives increased scrutiny, including from more than a dozen Democrats vying to take on the president in the 2020 elections.\nRepublicans are poised to attack those Democratic candidates for holding up emergency aid to flood-hit states, including Iowa, which is the first state to hold its presidential nominating contest every four years.\nPuerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, a Democrat, said over the weekend that while the nutrition assistance in the Senate bill would be \u201cvital to the well being of our citizens,\u201d it still \u201cfalls short\u201d of what is needed on the island of more than 3 million that has struggled to rebuild after the hurricane.\nTrump has repeatedly accused Puerto Rico and its leaders, including Rossell\u00f3 and San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, a vocal Trump critic, of mismanaging recovery funds and said the island should not receive additional assistance.\n\u201cPuerto Rico has been taken care of better by Donald Trump than by any living human being,\u201d Trump told reporters last week. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how to spend the money and they\u2019re not spending it wisely.\u201d\nRossell\u00f3 has insisted the island is only asking for the same help given to U.S. states and repeatedly sought a meeting with the president, but his efforts have been rebuffed. Rossell\u00f3 said in a recent CNN interview that Puerto Rico had struggled to obtain billions of dollars in assistance from the Trump administration that was already approved by Congress.\nThe island is navigating the largest government bankruptcy in U.S. history, with $120 billion of combined bond and pension debt when it declared bankruptcy in May 2017 after more than a decade of recession.\n\u2018PETTY GRUDGES\u2019 Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, who has authored an alternative disaster assistance bill, accused the president of picking \u201cwinners and losers.\u201d\n\u201cInstead of standing with our neighbors, our fellow Americans, the president has chosen to hold petty grudges that are way beneath the office of the presidency,\u201d Leahy said on the Senate floor.\nThe topic of Puerto Rico and its recovery from Hurricane Maria surfaced repeatedly at a Monday forum of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates organized by labor unions and other liberal groups.\nAlthough Puerto Rico nationals are U.S. citizens and send a non-voting resident commissioner to the House, they are prohibited from voting in general presidential elections. But they can cast ballots in the nominating contests starting early next year.\nJuli\u00e1n Castro, a former San Antonio mayor, told the forum of his decision to kick off his campaign by visiting the island: \u201cThe reason I did that was to highlight the total failure of this administration but also to tell the people of the island you\u2019re Americans and we\u2019re thinking of you too.\u201d\nSenators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who are also vying for the White House, have both visited Puerto Rico as well. Yul\u00edn Cruz is a co-chair of Sanders\u2019 campaign.\nReporting by Amanda Becker and Richard Cowan; Additional reporting by Roberta Rampton, Susan Cornwell and Steve Holland; Editing by Peter Cooney Don't let Silicon Valley control what you see.

However, what they tend to leave out is that the fighting ended with an armistice agreement, not an official peace treaty. Technically, the Koreas remain at war to this day, with the four main belligerents (the two Koreas, China, and the United States) unable to reach an agreement. And for 65 years and counting, despite the multiple overtures for peace, the war's shadow still looms over the peninsula.\nLast February, the effort to reach a permanent peace deal was stalled when talks between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and American president Donald Trump in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi were cut short by differences over North Korea's nuclear program. The talks' failure marked a low point in the string of negotiations with North Korea that was begun by Kim and South Korean president Moon Jae-in in April 2018 . Across the world, many wrote off the Hanoi Summit has the end of yet another failed attempt to make some sort of peace in Korea.\nStill, there remains a chance to salvage these negotiations and end the war. Moon and Kim are planning to meet at least once in 2019, and the US could still return to the negotiating table with North Korea; Trump's decision to cancel additional sanctions on North Korea signal a desire for a deal. In order to accomplish an effective framework for a peace deal, however, American policymakers ought to approach the negotiations with three key understandings.\n1. There needs to be compromise on the nuclear issue. Weapons on display in a parade in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whrFgO94M3I\nDonald Trump's decision to take a hardline approach meant to force North Korea to completely dismantle all of its nuclear weapons is what made the Hanoi Summit fail. Given North Korea's weak economy and reliance on China to even stay afloat, the possession of nuclear weapons is one of the few sources of clout that Kim Jong-un has on the wider world stage. As the past talks have shown, he does not take the possibility of discarding them lightly\nStill, leading up to and following his June 2018 meeting with Trump in Singapore, Kim voiced a willingness to make some sort of compromise on denuclearization and to halt nuclear tests (although intelligence reports suggest that North Korea may have resumed activity in some weapon facilities). In response, Trump halted the war games that the US military regularly conducts with South Korean troops. In light of this interaction, how could North Korea be enticed to stop expanding its nuclear arsenal?\nOf course, Kim and Trump will need to meet halfway again, but with bigger bargaining chips. A possible solution could involve the US lowering the number of its troops in Korea and easing some sanctions in exchange for North Korea reducing the size of its nuclear arsenal and allowing international inspectors (such as those from the International Atomic Energy Agency, an international organization advocating for the peaceful use of nuclear energy) to ensure its compliance with peace agreements. Neither side would have all of its demands fulfilled completely, but it would help de-escalate tensions for future negotiations.\n2. American partisan politics must stay out of the negotiations in Korea. Donald Trump meets with Kim Jong-un in Hanoi, Vietnam.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rceK7wfi_NA\nThere is a caveat that would make the possibility of compromise with North Korea difficult: many in the US Congress have sought to prevent the US military from lowering troops numbers in Korea and, more generally, have not been supportive of Trump's attempts to negotiate with North Korea. Many Republicans have traditionally opposed such talks with the Kim regime, with some such as current National Security Adviser John Bolton taking a particularly hawkish stance on US-North Korea relations.\nLately, however, many Democrats have also been blocking attempts to reach out to North Korea, due in part to their opposition to Donald Trump. Prominent Democratic senators such as Bob Menendez of New Jersey have even called out attempts by South Korea to over economic incentives to the North in order to bring them to the negotiating table. Other Democratic leaders such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California have told their Korean counterparts to be wary of negotiating with the North, much to the delight to right-wing politicians in South Korea who oppose a peace deal.\nOf course, there are plenty of reasons to criticize the way in which Trump has gone about the negotiations. The failure of the Hanoi Summit shows why. It is more than reasonable to question Trump's often inconsistent approach to North Korea, which seems to change at his whim at times, and his motivations; achieving a peace deal would no doubt enhance Trump's foreign policy reputation, something Trump realizes and likely craves.\nThat, however, is no excuse for sabotaging a good chance to reach an agreement with the North Korean regime. Regardless of Trump's motivations, ending the Korean War is the best way to lower the risk of armed conflict on the peninsula. American negotiators will need the support of members of Congress to craft an effective agreement with North Korea, and those members who wish for peace but do not wish to give Trump a foreign policy victory should remember not to allow partisanship to cloud their judgment.\n3. The best thing the US can do is to make it as easy for the Koreas to form a relationship on their own as possible. Kim Jong-un (left) and South Korean president Moon Jae-in shake hands at the village of Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=215R2F1JjeE\nPerhaps one of the greatest tragedies of the conflict on the Korean Peninsula is the way in which a nation having just been liberated from decades of the Japanese occupation was torn apart in large part due to the power struggle between outside powers (namely the United States, China, and the Soviet Union). Even today, the rivalry between China and the US (as well as American allies like Japan) hinders some possibilities for peace and cooperation in Korea.\nSeeing that these outside powers make achieving peace difficult, it is clear that it should be up to the Koreans (from both the north and south) to decide how the two states should interact with each other. It is imperative that both China and the United States truly value allowing the people of Korea to have the power of \"determining the destiny of the Korean nation on their own accord\" as stated in the Panmunjom Declaration signed by Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong-un in April 2018.\nUltimately, it should be up to the Korean people to work out the relationship they choose to have with their follow Koreans on the other side of the DMZ. Despite the growing differences between those in the north and in the south, they still share a common nation and are best-suited to make the deals that would be in the peninsula's best interest. The United States should respect this right but working with China and the Koreas to end the war and leaving the Koreas to engage with each other as they wish.\nTo be clear, this call for an actual peace deal in Korea should not be seen as a rejection of or indifference to the charges of human rights abuses and other authoritarian activities frequently directed toward the current regime in North Korea. These charges are legitimate concerns and should not be left out of the conversation in any peace deal.\nHowever, these abuses are unlikely to change unless the North Korean regime is either overthrown or incentivized to change their ways. Given the potential of a bloody and violent war in the former scenario, the latter seems to present the best path towards changing the practices of the North Korean regime.\nAbove all, embracing these understandings when negotiating would allow the US to cease formal hostilities and finally create a base for peace on the Korean peninsula.\nIt has been 65 years and counting since the ceasefire. It's time to end the war.\nKeep Reading", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.thenation.com/article/north-korea-democrats-peace-talks/", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa-wargames/trump-says-to-stop-expensive-provocative-south-korea-war-games-idUSKBN1J80T5", "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/world/asia/north-korea-sanctions.html", "https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-north-korea-john-bolton-1348442", "https://www.googletagservices.com/tag/js/gpt.js", "https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/27/politics/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-vietnam-summit/index.html", "https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-northkorea-southkorea-summit-statemen/panmunjom-declaration-for-peace-prosperity-and-unification-of-the-korean-peninsula-idUKKBN1HY193", "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/world/asia/north-korea-missile-site.html", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whrFgO94M3I", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rceK7wfi_NA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=215R2F1JjeE", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/04/27/the-historic-kim-moon-meeting-as-it-unfolded/?utm_term=.50a3693ff29d"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "moon jae-in", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong-un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koreas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanoi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T05:20:15.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b85b4c3249217a46540aac6317d0d0658655f21", "url": "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/americas/2019/04/01/mexicos-top-security-officials-says-he-entered-us-illegally.html", "site_full": "www.thestar.com", "site": "thestar.com", "site_section": "http://www.thestar.com/feeds.articles.news.world.rss", "site_categories": ["media", "hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "TORONTO STAR", "title": "Mexico\u2019s top security official says he entered US illegally", "title_full": "Mexico\u2019s top security official says he entered US illegally | The Star", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.thestar.com/2H2gMVIw05TexHZymLxjhHJsROs=/1280x1024/smart/filters:cb(1554166418511)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/americas/2019/04/01/mexicos-top-security-official-says-he-entered-us-illegally/NYHK105-1115_2018_022900.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3654, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4b85b4c3249217a46540aac6317d0d0658655f21", "url": "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/americas/2019/04/01/mexicos-top-security-officials-says-he-entered-us-illegally.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "thestar.com", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Mexico\u2019s top security official says he entered US illegally", "text": "News World Americas Mexico\u2019s top security official says he entered US illegally By Mon., April 1, 2019 MEXICO CITY - Mexico\u2019s top security official says he twice crossed illegally into the United States in his youth to work.\nLa Jornada newspaper reported Monday that Public Safety Secretary Alfonso Durazo told a business gathering in the northern state of Sonora that out of economic necessity he went to the U.S. to wash cars and dishes.\nIn this Nov. 14, 2018 file photo, future Secretary of Public Security, Dr. Alfonso Durazo Montano speaks about the proposed changes to national security during the national peace and security plan conference in Mexico City.

Influential research and development in AI increasingly comes from China. \u00a9 Reuters\nNEW YORK -- Artificial intelligence will become an undergraduate major at 35 universities in China, as the country charges ahead with its ambition to rival the U.S. in the field by 2020.\nThe Education Ministry's approval of the program comes as China grapples with growing domestic demand for AI talent and a heated race with the U.S. to become the future powerhouse of AI-related technologies.\nThe 35 schools include Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, which is administered by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, as well as prestigious names such as Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Zhejiang University.\nThough AI has been available as a concentration for computer science students at some Chinese universities, the new four-year courses will be the first to confer bachelor's degrees devoted to the field.\n\"Chinese industry and government has continued to invest heavily in AI, especially through venture funding for AI silicon startups such as Horizon Robotics and Cambricon,\" said Karl Freund, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, told the Nikkei Asian Review via an e-mail.\n\"With funding no longer a major roadblock, the industry needs to produce a qualified and experienced workforce. If AI is indeed going to become 'the new electricity,' making AI available at the undergraduate level will enable the needed workforce to emerge,\" he added.\nBeijing vowed to rivals the world's front-runner by 2020 and to dominate to field by 2030 as part of an AI strategy laid out in 2017.\nChina is moving swiftly toward that target. Influential research on AI increasingly comes from China, according to an analysis published last month by the Seattle-based Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.\nResearchers in the study said that China is poised to overtake the U.S. in the most-cited 50% of papers this year, the 10% most-cited papers next year, and the top 1% by 2025.\nChina's government also invests in tech companies to advance the application of AI. Through a state-owned venture fund, it has been a backer of Face++, a startup specializing in facial recognition technology.\nAmid the AI boom, however, China faces a shortage of homegrown talent, who would play a crucial role in building everything from self-driving technology to optimized e-commerce practices.\nAlmost one-third of global talent in machine learning -- the dominant branch of artificial intelligence -- is concentrated in the U.S., according to a December report by Diffbot, a California-based data company.\nChina hosts only 3.5% of the global machine learning workforce, despite having a population four times that of the U.S. The study also shows that over 60% of those in the country with machine learning skills left for the U.S.\nYet Beijing's ambition and progress in developing artificial intelligence have alarmed Washington, where academics and government officials alike have urged the Trump administration to devise a plan to support the country's AI development.\nIn February, President Donald Trump issued an executive order on maintaining American leadership in the field of AI. While Beijing plans full support for this national project, Trump's initiative has been criticized for its lack of public funding.

Tax cuts, therefore, could help boost spending, although that is unlikely to deter RBA from adopting an easing bias in the coming months, as the economy seems to be facing a perfect storm of record household debt and falling property values.\nWestpac expects the RBA to move to a clear easing bias following the May meeting. However, it is unlikely that there will be any hints of this action in the April Governor\u2019s Statement.\nAnalysts at TD securities are of the opinion that the Bank can afford to assess developments over coming months - the next read on consumption is Q1 GDP on 5th June.\nAll-in-all, today's rate decision may not move the needle on the Aussie pairs unless the central bank downgrades its language on the labor market, in which case the AUD will likely take a beating across the board.\nThat said, AUD/USD is sidelined in the range of 0.7170-0.7050 since March 20 - a sign the RBA is not expected to deliver a hawkish/dovish surprise ahead of the budget announcement. As of writing, the spot is trading largely unchanged at 0.7107.

If the RBA is hawkish about the inflationary outlook of the economy and raises the interest rates it is positive, or bullish, for the AUD. Likewise, if the RBA has a dovish view on the Australian economy and keeps the ongoing interest rate, or cuts the interest rate it is seen as negative, or bearish.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

But with the unemployment rate still near cycle lows at 3.8%, there is still evidence that the labor market remains tight by the FOMC\u2019s standards.

The January employment change was 66.8K jobs, while the topline February reading came in at 55.9K. Even though the Bloomberg consensus calls for the March report to only show 10K jobs added, the unemployment rate is due to stay on hold at 5.8%.

After all, the February reading was a meager 20K.\nBut with the unemployment rate still near cycle lows at 3.8%, there is still evidence that the labor market remains tight by the FOMC\u2019s standards . Market participants are expecting that March reading will show a strong rebound, given that jobless claims remain low.\nAccordingly, current expectations for the data are calling for the unemployment rate to hold at 3.8 %, and for the headline jobs figure to come in at +1 70 K. Wage growth is expected to remain at its 10-year high of 3.4% y/y as well.\nAccording to the Atlanta Fed Jobs Growth Calculator, the economy only needs +111K jobs growth per month over the next 12-months to sustain said unemployment rate at its current 3.8 % level.\nPairs to Watch: DXY Index, EURUSD , USDJPY , Gold EURUSD Price Chart: Daily Timeframe (May 2018 to April 2019)\nEURUSD has been on a losing streak since the Fed\u2019s March meeting, falling all but one day since March 20. Momentum is firmly to the downside right now, with price squarely below the daily 8-, 13-, and 21-EMA envelope in sequential order. Likewise, daily MACD and Slow Stochastics are trending lower, with the former having crossed below its signal line last week; the latter is nearing a sell signal. A test of the yearly low at 1.1176 is not out of the question by the end of the week (nor would be a break to fresh yearly lows). IG Client Sentiment Index: EURUSD (April 4, 2019)\nRetail trader data shows 72.2% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 2.59 to 1. In fact, traders have remained net-long since Mar 26 when EURUSD traded near 1.12738; price has moved 0.5% lower since then. The number of traders net-long is 1.7% lower than yesterday and 26.1% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 10.5% higher than yesterday and 16.3% lower from last week.\nWe typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests EURUSD prices may continue to fall. Positioning is less net-long than yesterday but more net-long from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed EURUSD trading bias.

But they can cast ballots in the nominating contests starting early next year.\nJulin Castro, a former San Antonio mayor, told the forum of his decision to kick off his campaign by visiting the island: 'The reason I did that was to highlight the total failure of this administration but also to tell the people of the island you're Americans and we're thinking of you too.'\nSenators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who are also vying for the White House, have both visited Puerto Rico as well. Yuln Cruz is a co-chair of Sanders' campaign.

She ignored him and boarded a cycle rickshaw as she had to visit a few more stores on a street near Suncity but Nishant kept following her.\n\u201cI visited three shops in the locality and the man followed me in his Swift Dzire. This went on for nearly 50 minutes. He even tried to stop the rickshaw a few times. When I encountered him, he touched me inappropriately,\u201d the woman said in her complaint.\nShe called the guards when she was near her housing society\u2019s gates and called her sister for help. \u201cI rushed to the gate and called the police control room. The accused was drunk and misbehaved with us when we tried to resist. He tried to flee, but the guards caught hold of him and handed him over to police,\u201d the sister said.\nSandeep Singh, station house officer of Indirapuram police station, said, \u201cBased on the woman\u2019s complaint, an FIR under sections 354 D (assault or criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the IPC has been registered at Indirapuram police station. The accused has been arrested and sent to jail while his car has been seized by police.\u201d\nThe woman said she was a freelance journalist who wrote for foreign publications. \u201cShe is so petrified that she has decided not to cover the elections but return home to the US,\u201d the sister said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "frid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nishant kaushik", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ghaziabad news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nishant", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ghaziabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ghaziabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indirapuram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shipra suncity", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T05:30:43.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb9e6998040de3c1d9b6b73dfdd20617345fa3b1", "url": "https://za.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-stocks-snapshotwall-street-rallies-after-upbeat-data-1440439", "site_full": "za.investing.com", "site": "investing.com", "site_section": "https://za.investing.com/news/stock-market-news", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Stock Market News - Investing.com ZA", "title": "US STOCKS SNAPSHOT-Wall Street rallies after upbeat data By Reuters", "title_full": "US STOCKS SNAPSHOT-Wall Street rallies after upbeat data By Reuters", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB5S0BT_L.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 699, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb9e6998040de3c1d9b6b73dfdd20617345fa3b1", "url": "https://za.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-stocks-snapshotwall-street-rallies-after-upbeat-data-1440439", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Reuters", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "US STOCKS SNAPSHOT-Wall Street rallies after upbeat data By Reuters", "text": "\u00a9 Reuters.
