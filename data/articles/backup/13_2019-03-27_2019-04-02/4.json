(AP) \u2014 The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration viewed one drug-producing company as the \"kingpin within a drug cartel,\" according to a Tennessee lawsuit over the opioid epidemic.\nA nearly 250-page amended complaint filed Monday in Circuit Court for Cumberland County said the DEA labeled Mallinckrodt a \"kingpin\" because it shipped opioids in high volumes to pharmacies it knew were feeding \"pill mills\" in Florida, which supplied Tennessee's illegal drug market.\nA spokesman for St. Louis-based Mallinckrodt called it a \"gross and inflammatory mischaracterization of the facts designed to create headlines.\"\nThe new claims come as drug companies field a flurry of lawsuits nationwide over the scourge of opioid abuse.\nThe Tennessee complaint was filed on behalf of five district attorneys general and a child born addicted to opioids.\nIt targets Mallinckrodt and other opioid producers; distributors; pharmacies; alleged \"pill mill\" prescribers; and Richard Sackler, whose family owns Purdue Pharma.\nAccording to the lawsuit, a national account manager for Mallinckrodt once said in a phone conversation with a Florida distributor that the company's opioids were \"just like Doritos; keep eating, we'll make more.\"\nThe Mallinckrodt spokesman called it \"an outrageously callous email from an individual who has not been employed by the company for many years.\"\n\"It is antithetical to everything that Mallinckrodt stands for and has done to combat opioid abuse and misuse,\" he continued.\nThe lawsuit also says that another drug maker, Endo, at one point chose to exclude Tennessee abuse numbers of one of its opioids from its nationwide calculations because they were so high. They claimed a special \"effect of Tennessee\" that includes what \"might be a more severe group of opioid abusers with more intravenous experience than those in other states,\" the lawsuit states.\nA spokeswoman for Endo did not immediately respond to a voicemail and email requesting comment.

'Basic principles'\nNow, having imposed just such a sanction, the UK's regulator has asked Mr Zuckerberg to show that his warm words about regulation are sincere.\nA source at the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said that if Facebook wanted to win back public trust this would be one necessary step.\nI asked Facebook whether, in the light of those remarks from Mr Zuckerberg and Ms Denham's comments, the appeal against the fine would now be dropped.\nA spokesman made it clear that was not going to happen, pointing to the reasons for the appeal given back in November.\nAt that time, Facebook's lawyer Anna Benckert argued that the ICO's reasoning \"challenges some of the basic principles of how people should be allowed to share information online, with implications which go far beyond just Facebook, which is why we have chosen to appeal\".\nI wrote then that the last-minute decision by Facebook to launch its appeal was hugely risky at a time when it was trying to rebuild its reputation.\nNow the stakes have just got higher.

Even if your country allows you to take on all of the tax responsibilities, which is relatively uncommon, the company will have to spend money even getting an expert on your country's laws to confirm this. Otherwise, the company will have to comply with tax laws of the US, the state the company is in, and your country. In some cases, it might even cost the company more money to comply with the tax laws of your parent country than your salary. It is not even that uncommon for smaller US companies hiring remote workers that must be based out of only one state, because it is costly to even comply with multiple US state tax and benefit rules.\nThis also raises issues with tax incentives that might be offered by the either the US federal or state governments. Some locations might provide tax breaks for employing local citizens.\nLabor Laws\nLabor laws vary even between different states, and vary drastically between different countries. There is a lot of cost involved with even identifying all of company's responsibilities to you\u2014let alone complying with all of the applicable labor laws. How many days off a year do I have to give you? If you have a child, do I lose you as an employee for 6 months, but still have to pay you? What am I allowed to do with your employee data, and how am I required to store it?\nTechnology & Export Laws\nThere are laws that restrict the flow of technology from the US. Take for example, encryption export laws\u2014although these have been greatly relaxed in recent years, there are still restrictions on what encryption algorithms are allowed to be used in products sold to a non-US country. This also leaves the potential for gray areas\u2014it can be difficult to determine the legality of having someone who lives in country A working on technology X. In some cases, this could either be very expensive to figure out & keep track of, or the law might be ambiguous enough that it is easier to simply not have to worry about this becoming an issue at all.\nIntellectual Property Concerns\nCountries tend to have different laws dealing with IP, and some countries are known to ignore IP claims of other countries if doing so has the potential to benefit them (as an example, look at claims of IP theft in China for the last few years). It is potentially easier to protect your company's IP if both you and your employees are following the same rules. Also, if an employee steals a company's IP in the US, there is a clear path for the company to take legal action against that employee.\nMarketing\nDue to how many jobs have left the US to go overseas, it can be useful for marketing if companies are able to say that their products are fully made in the US, or that they only employ US citizens.\nGovernment Contracts\nWithin the US, there are multiple levels of government, all of which have their own rules on who they allow to bid on and win contracts for government work. Government work is usually one of the most stable, and sometimes the most lucrative, sources of revenue for a lot of these companies. For example, if your US company has foreign-based employees, and is fulfilling a contract for the US Department of Defense, your US-based employees might not even be able to talk to non-US-based employees without extensively documenting every time they have a conversation. There might also be state or lower governments who require or give preference to companies who are employing people who work in their districts (in an attempt to keep taxes and jobs as local as possible).\nSecurity\nCompanies will generally want to vet that you are who you say you are, that you are not a criminal, and that you do not partake in illicit drugs. They will usually already have a partnership or contract with a company who can perform background checks on you. In the US, it is not uncommon for even retail style jobs to require you to undergo a background check and drug screening. If you are not US-based, the company might not be able to get a reliable, accurate background check done, or might not want to spend the time and money it will cost to find a company in your location to complete it.\nThis also concerns cyber security. Depending upon the security controls for a given company, they might not feel comfortable allowing VPN access to their internal network from a foreign country, or they might not want to face increased risk of the data you might have stored becoming compromised.\nConclusion\nThe US is a large country, and has a lot of highly skilled individuals. There are not too many remote jobs where it would not be possible to find a US worker who is able to complete that work. Given that it almost always possible to find a US-based worker to fulfill a role, and all of the potential pitfalls listed above when hiring a foreign worker, it makes sense that non-international US-based companies would primarily hire US-based workers.

Burger King, known for meaty excess in the US, is now selling a plant-based burger. The chain, owned by Restaurant Brands International, announced a test run for the burger in 59 restaurants in the St Louis area of the US. Burger King says the sandwich will use patties from Impossible Foods. The Impossible Whopper is flame-grilled like the regular Whopper, and comes with the standard tomatoes, lettuce, mayonnaise, ketchup, pickles and onion. Burger King is an unlikely early adopter of plant-based meat in the fast-food industry. It already offers veggie patties made by Kellogg's MorningStar Farms. Impossible Burgers, however, are designed to mimic meat using the company's novel \"magic\" ingredient, heme, produced with a genetically modified yeast. The move underscores how chains are looking for new ways to gain an edge over rivals as competition heats up - and the rapid growth in demand for meat alternatives may fuel a new battleground in this fight. McDonald's, like most major fast-food companies, doesn't offer meat-free burgers in the US, though it recently introduced chicken-free vegan nuggets in Norway. That may change as consumer demand rises across the industry for non-meat options.

Well, this is too much to handle for us, Miley! \u2014 Miley Ray Cyrus (@MileyCyrus) March 29, 2019 Despite a range of new series that we get to consume every day, there's no taking for granted the impact that Hannah \"legendary\" Montana left on us. There's no forgetting the time when all we wanted was to be part of her two different lives. It's totally one of the greatest shows of our childhood! And since Miley already started it, we're here to reminisce the best of both worlds in the Hannah Montana universe. Let's go back to Disney Channel circa 2006, shall we? 1. The Miley-Lilly Duo Miley and Lilly defined the ultimate friendship goals back then! These two taught us that in all of life's adventures and dramas, true friends stay honest, supportive, and reliable\u2014even when they're living double lives! 2. Miley's expressions It's so impossible not to notice the cast's handful of funny and remarkable lines which, perhaps, have slipped into your everyday expressions unconsciously. From \"say what?\" to \"sweet niblets,\" we bet you all know it by heart. 3. Hannah's jams Songs come and go with time but not Hannah Montana's. Remember when \"Best of Both Worlds\" is what we sounded like when we breathe? Yup, we still do. 4. The fashion transformations There was a time when we'll willingly exchange our closet with Miley and Hannah just to live like a sassy student by day and a glitzy diva by night. We're pretty sure that you've copied more than one outfit from her when you were younger! 4. The surprise guests The Jonas Brothers, Selena Gomez, Ashley Tisdale\u2014you name it. Hannah Montana has the best celebrity guests and Disney crossovers in television history! 5. The double life of Miley and Hannah Truth be told, it wasn't easy for Miley Stewart and Hannah Montana to live two different lives but she totally nailed it. This serves as a friendly reminder that everybody has a lot going on in their lives, but passion is what makes it easier! Hannah Montana wrapped up eight years ago, but our love for this iconic show won't die down just like that. A sequel, perhaps? Miley sure is getting our hopes up more than ever before!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MileyCyrus/status/1111476958099996672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "miley cy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "miley cyrus", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hannah montana", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "\u2014 miley ray cyrus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hannah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lilly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "disney channel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "montana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hannah montana", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T09:14:28.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e804d4d559fa3d6793447e7ceff2367baddf743d", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/news/3447421-vale-plus-4-percent-higher-iron-prices-despite-losing-certifications-asset-freeze", "site_full": "seekingalpha.com", "site": "seekingalpha.com", "site_section": "https://seekingalpha.com/market-news/sectors", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "mutual_funds"], "section_title": "Stock Picks, Stock Market Investing | Seeking Alpha", "title": "Vale +4% on higher iron prices despite losing certifications, asset freeze -

This marks the first concrete U.S. step to block delivery of the jet to the NATO ally in light of Ankara's planned purchase of a Russian missile defense system. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has refused to back down from Ankara's planned purchase of a Russian S-400 missile defense system that the United States has said would compromise the security of F-35 aircraft. Published 2:00 AM ET Tue, 2 April 2019 Reuters Atilgan Ozdil | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images A F-35 fighter jet is seen as Turkey takes delivery of its first F-35 fighter jet with a ceremony at the Lockheed Martin in Forth Worth, Texas, United States on June 21, 2018.\nThe United States has halted delivery of equipment related to the stealthy F-35 fighter aircraft to Turkey , marking the first concrete U.S. step to block delivery of the jet to the NATO ally in light of Ankara's planned purchase of a Russian missile defense system.\nU.S. officials told their Turkish counterparts they will not receive further shipments of F-35 related equipment needed to prepare for the arrival of the stealthy jet, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday.\nThe Pentagon confirmed the Reuters report that the equipment delivery had been stopped.\n\"Pending an unequivocal Turkish decision to forgo delivery of the S-400, deliveries and activities associated with the stand-up of Turkey's F-35 operational capability have been suspended,\" Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Mike Andrews, a Defense Department spokesman, said in a statement.\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan has refused to back down from Ankara's planned purchase of a Russian S-400 missile defense system that the United States has said would compromise the security of F-35 aircraft.\nThe disagreement over the F-35 is the latest of a series of diplomatic disputes between the United States and Turkey including Turkish demands that the United States extradite Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, differences over Middle East policy and the war in Syria , and sanctions on Iran .\nThe sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the next shipment of training equipment, and all subsequent shipments of F-35 related material, had been canceled. The aircraft is built by Lockheed Martin Corp .\nA Pentagon official had told Reuters in March that the United States had a number of items it could withhold in order to send Turkey a signal that the United States was serious about Ankara dropping its ambition to own the S-400.\nTurkish officials in Ankara were not immediately available for comment. Turkey has said it will take delivery of the S-400s in July. NATO summit\nThe U.S. decision on the F-35s was expected to complicate Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu's visit to Washington this week for a NATO summit. On Sunday, Erdogan suffered one of his biggest electoral losses in decades in local elections.\n\"Certain Russian weapon systems are seen as inherently threatening to the United States regardless of who is operating them and for what purpose,\" Andrew Hunter, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said.\n\"Because Turkey is not just an F-35 purchaser, but an industrial partner, blocking delivery of these systems represents a major escalation by the United States as it threatens to impose serious costs on both sides,\" Hunter said.\nReuters reported last week that Washington was exploring whether it could remove Turkey from production of the F-35. Turkey makes parts of the fuselage, landing gear and cockpit displays. Sources familiar with the F-35's intricate worldwide production process and U.S. thinking on the issue last week said Turkey's role can be replaced.\nThe United States and other NATO allies that own F-35s fear the radar on the Russian S-400 missile system will learn how to spot and track the jet, making it less able to evade Russian weapons.\nIn an attempt to persuade Turkey to drop its plans to buy the S-400, the United States offered the pricier American-made Patriot anti-missile system in a discounted deal that expired at the end of March. Turkey has shown interest in the Patriot system, but not at the expense of abandoning the S-400.\nTurkey has engaged with U.S. negotiators in recent days about buying the Patriot system, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The system is made by Raytheon Co .\nTurkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar in March said that despite some issues, Turkish pilots were continuing their training at an air base in Arizona on the F-35, each of which costs $90 million, and that Ankara was expecting the aircraft to arrive in Turkey in November.\nBy halting jet deliveries, the Pentagon could subsequently delay training of Turkish pilots. Two additional jets are scheduled to arrive in Arizona in April and a significant delay could impact Turkey's November target date for operations.\nU.S. lawmakers also have expressed alarm over Turkey's planned purchase of the Russian system. Four U.S. senators last week introduced a bipartisan bill that would prohibit the transfer of F-35s to Turkey until the U.S. government certifies that Ankara will not take delivery of the S-400 system.\nFollowing news of the halt, U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, one of the bill sponsors, said she was glad to hear the administration was \"to delay the transfer of F-35 equipment to Turkey to help ensure U.S. military technology and capabilities cannot fall into the hands of the Kremlin.\" Related Securities", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mins ago reuters atilgan ozdil | anadolu agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lockheed martin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forth worth", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T09:16:07.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5dd2907cd434a55d553761baf38b185b6a456c01", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/news/3447329-3d-systems-plus-1-percent-nokia-integration", "site_full": "seekingalpha.com", "site": "seekingalpha.com", "site_section": "https://seekingalpha.com/market-news/on-the-move", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "mutual_funds"], "section_title": "Stock Picks, Stock Market Investing | Seeking Alpha", "title": "3D Systems +1% on Nokia integration -

The U.S. and China are now negotiating a deal, with representatives from both countries expected to meet in Washington this week .\n\"Business sentiment across the globe is extraordinarily fragile,\" the economist told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday. He added that a survey conducted by Moody's recently showed that confidence among companies was at its weakest since the end of the financial crisis a decade ago.\n\"Businesses are really on edge and I think it's because of this trade war. And if it's not settled in the next couple (to) three months, I think a global recession is highly likely,\" said Zandi. show chapters 5:37 PM ET Wed, 27 March 2019 | 00:45\nIf talks between the U.S. and China break down and end without a trade deal, that could hurt business sentiment further and lead companies to reduce hiring, he said. When that happens, unemployment would rise, causing consumers to lose faith in the economy, he explained.\n\"The difference between an expanding economy and a recessionary one is simply faith \u2014 faith that the economy is going to be okay. And if you lose faith, no central banks are going to get that back. That's a recession,\" said Zandi. Brexit problem\nAdding to risks facing the global economy is the potential that the U.K. would leave the European Union without a withdrawal agreement.\nOn Monday, the British parliament again failed to break a deadlock surrounding the country's departure from the EU. Lawmakers thrice rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's divorce deal but couldn't find an alternative.\nZandi said his \"very subjective\" guess is that there's a one-third probability that Brexit would happen without a deal, which \"feels uncomfortably high.\" show chapters 2:38 AM ET Fri, 29 March 2019 | 03:29\n\"If we have a no-deal Brexit ... certainly the U.K. economy and the EU economy will be in recession, and I think the rest of the global economy will be not too far behind. So I think that'll be a real problem as well,\" he said.\nSigns of slower growth in several major European economies are already threatening countries globally, noted Frederic Neumann, managing director and co-head of Asian economics research at HSBC . If Brexit pushes Europe into a recession, emerging economies \u2014 particularly those in Asia \u2014 could get hit through two channels, he said.\nFor one, \"Europe would disappear as a big driver of demand for exports,\" Neumann told CNBC's \"Capital Connection\" on Tuesday.\nSecondly, a weaker Europe would lead to a rally in the U.S. dollar as investors seek safer investments, he said. \"A stronger dollar is never good for (emerging markets),\" Neumann added.

The PMI recorded shown 50.8 for the month of March which was well above the market expectation of 49.9. This positive March figure helped the Chinese stocks reach new heights, but the Yuan currency was left unlifted much. The softening of the US-Sino Trade also bolstered the USD/CNY during the day. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He had mentioned that he would have a meet up with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for more trade talks.\nEUR/USD The Euro pair opened on Monday morning near 1.1223 level. The start was quite intriguing. The pair shot up reaching 1.1249 level following Spain\u2019s above consensus March Markit Manufacturing PMI of 50.9 points. The EUR/USD , however, couldn\u2019t sustain at those high levels for an extended period.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/uUkHv.QNw_oUFVqfPr32.A--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/fx_empire_176/bf2680b8a598e4f0f8fafa8bc3fb9c65);", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/usd-jpy/overview", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-canada-says-data-suggests-slowdown-is-temporary-11554147724&quot;", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/usd-cny/overview", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ye7tMr8wbu_sZUwCKsLXTg--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/fx_empire_176/7843a21eb691e0ff107454429f21ae0c", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/usd-cad/overview", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/eur-usd/overview", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/eur-usd/overview&quot;", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/usd-cny/overview&quot;", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-canada-says-data-suggests-slowdown-is-temporary-11554147724", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/usd-cad/overview&quot;", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/usd-jpy/overview&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ye7tMr8wbu_sZUwCKsLXTg--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/fx_empire_176/7843a21eb691e0ff107454429f21ae0c);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/uUkHv.QNw_oUFVqfPr32.A--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/fx_empire_176/bf2680b8a598e4f0f8fafa8bc3fb9c65"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stephen poloz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "forex daily recap", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bank of canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "march market manufacturing pmi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usdcad", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T09:53:52.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "22459e550e90ec8a250580ea913a214c7d3e27af", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aud-usd-price-forecast-australian-162751644.html", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://finance.yahoo.com/currency-converter", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo Finance - Business Finance, Stock Market, Quotes, News", "title": "AUD/USD Price Forecast \u2013 Australian dollar gapped higher to kick the week off", "title_full": "AUD/USD Price Forecast \u2013 Australian dollar gapped higher to kick the week off", "published": "2019-04-02T00:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.411, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ojgbRdLH7Z8V.H5gqQBCiA--~B/aD00MjA7dz02MzA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/fx_empire_176/c1b90de12e046c4a6d856be8967a719b", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "22459e550e90ec8a250580ea913a214c7d3e27af", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aud-usd-price-forecast-australian-162751644.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FX Empire", "published": "2019-04-02T00:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "AUD/USD Price Forecast \u2013 Australian dollar gapped higher to kick the week off", "text": "The Australian dollar gapped higher at the open on Monday, breaking above the 50 day EMA in the process. Over the longer-term, we continue to see buyers in this market on short-term pullbacks, as there is a massive amount of support below at the 0.70 level. With that being the case, I continue to buy this market on short-term pullbacks as the level has been so reliable and is visible on even the monthly time frames. That being the case, I don\u2019t have any interest in shorting this market and I look at these pullbacks as buying opportunities.\nAUD/USD Video 02.04.19 Overall, I like the idea of buying and picking up about 20 or 30 pips, and simply collect my profits. That doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t eventually break out, I do believe we will give enough time. However, the attitude of the market is very much one of a \u201cbuy on the dips\u201d situation. However, beyond that we have massive resistance above in the form of the 200 day EMA, which currently sits at about the 0.72 level. Remember, this pair is essentially waiting on the results of the US/China trade relations, which of course are still in the back and forth situation, so I think at this point we are simply churning trying to figure out where we are going longer-term. For my money, this looks a lot like a bottoming process, which of course can take quite some time.

The pair was found to recover previous losses under the light of upbeat Chinese data released during the Asian session easing economic sluggishness in China. This easiness in the economy helped the Crude Oil prices to reach new heights. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was trading at $60.80 per barrel, 1.15 percent up for the day.\nThe Commodity-linked currency \u2013 Canadian dollars also benefited from the oil price surge. The loonie pair, however, was seen to remain range bound during the day. The pair had sustained between the resistance level of 1.3370 and 1.3341 support level.

His view may help the market participants to predict the possible interest-rate movements. Canada has joined the US with regards to having an Inverted Yield Curve on 21 March. The difference between the short term yields and the yields on long term bonds becoming negative, posses the threat of possible economic recession.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to be talking about cutting rates at this juncture,\u201d said Doug Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal. Poloz \u201ccould take one more turn of the dovish screw, I suppose, by going completely neutral \u2014 although I believe it would be more appropriate to do that at the next decision date. \u201d\nTechnical Analysis USDCAD 5 Min 1 April 2019 More The USD/CAD pair saw one of the most \u201cBoring\u201d sessions in the recent period. The pair seems to be trading in the narrow range with support level as 1.3399 and resistance as 1.3370. The USD/CAD pair which saw a sudden fall in the Friday\u2019s mid-session has not recovered/ extended in the market session. At around 13:25 GMT, the pair failed to break the major support level of 1.3339. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) confirms the lost momentum and the direction in the USD/CAD pair.

The US dollar index had plunged from its last week high levels reaching 97.10 level. This fall helped the GBP/USD pair to soar during the Asian session. The pair jumped from 1.3016 touching 1.3097 level on the USD Index pain.\nTrump\u2019s statement on Sunday warned that he might close the border with Mexico on the top of dreads out of domestic political tensions.

But if MPs succeeded in voting on alternative ways, then Theresa May could have to renegotiate, and she may call for General Election or Second Referendum as a possible outcome.\nAny positive signal that indicates a deal Brexit would help the Sterling Pound to ascend and recover its incurred losses.\nTechnical Analysis GBPUSD 5 Min 1 April 2019 More The Cable followed a seamless uptrend in the morning session hitting the last day\u2019s resistance level of 1.3124. The pair is heading to touch the next 1.3135 resistance level.

Better-than-expected Chinese Manufacturing PMI dampened fears of a global economic slowdown. This also helped reduce the U.S. Dollar\u2019s appeal as a safe-haven asset, encouraging traders to sell the greenback and buy the Euro. Traders also feel the news from China may lead to economic improvements in the Euro Zone. Furthermore, we could be looking at position-squaring ahead of a slew of U.S. economic data this week, including U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls on Friday.\nAt 12:19 GMT, the EUR/USD is trading 1.1234, up 0.0016 or +0.15%.\nDaily EUR/USD More Daily Technical Analysis The main trend is up according to the daily swing chart, but momentum has been trending lower since the week-ending March 22. A trade through 1.1177 will change the main trend to down. A move through 1.1448 will signal a resumption of the uptrend.\nThe minor trend is down. This supports the downside shift in momentum. A new minor bottom has formed at 1.1201. A trade through this level will reaffirm the minor downtrend.\nThe next support target is a major, long-term Fibonacci level at 1.1185.\nThe main range is 1.1177 to 1.1448. Its retracement zone at 1.1281 to 1.1313 is resistance.\nDaily Technical Forecast Based on the early price action, the direction of the EUR/USD on Monday is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the uptrending Gann angle at 1.1220.\nBullish Scenario A sustained move over 1.1220 will indicate the presence of buyers. If this creates enough upside momentum then look for a rally to possibly extend into the next uptrending Gann angle at 1.1262. Overtaking this angle could drive the EUR/USD into a Fibonacci level at 1.1281, followed closely by a downtrending Gann angle at 1.1288.\nBearish Scenario A sustained move under 1.1220 will signal the presence of sellers. Taking out 1.1201 will indicate the selling is getting stronger with the next downside targets the Fib level at 1.1185, followed by the main bottom at 1.1177. This is the potential trigger point for an acceleration into 1.1118, the June 20, 2017 main bottom.\nThe U.S. Retail Sales data was mixed so we saw no reaction by the Euro.

His high-concept themes and unorthodox methods\u2014manipulating samples from aerial warfare , a pig\u2019s life , and other artifacts of consumerism\u2014tend to overshadow the producer and composer\u2019s core mission: an earnest campaign to make us to consider not just sounds but also their sources, and to experience both as equals.\nThe project has a forbiddingly post-modern ring to it, so it\u2019s worth stressing that the best entry point to The State Between Us , his sprawling and guest-packed Brexit album, is also the easiest: Go in blind, and let his collage of jazz, house, blues and politically loaded field recordings lead your curiosity. Take \u201cThe Tower\u201d: The album track opens with a gentle shuffle and a staticky sound that eventually resolves into footsteps and wind. A shrill piano chord chimes from the periphery, the kind you might hear at a nuclear power station after pressing the wrong button. It rings out several times and settles only when a jazz beat skulks in, coaxing out a full-blown big band number. For the next few minutes, brass rises and falls in waves of rapture and panic. Then footsteps resume as a police siren sounds in the distance. After the song finishes, the curious can read a gut-wrenching footnote: Herbert made the field recording in London last May, on a silent march for the victims of the Grenfell Tower blaze.\nLike Brexit, the deadly fire that \u201cThe Tower\u201d commemorates has prompted allegations of state racism while entrenching divisions between British people and an indifferent elite. In a tone of inquiry and elegy, Herbert has found a way to eulogize these modern tragedies even as he pillories the political farce enabling them. Herbert has always obsessed over the big picture, which makes Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union a convenient problem: Now that cultural regression is headline news, he can make these bold proclamations without being branded a kook.\nIn 2017, Herbert revived the big band project he launched in 2003 and enlisted multinational guest singers and big bands to record his new songs. He wanted the reboot to advance a Brexit counter-narrative, and the record even had the same deadline as Brexit\u2014March 29\u2014but, unlike the British government, he\u2019s sticking to it. He enlisted local big bands around Europe for short-notice tour dates and recorded in their dressing rooms. He deployed proxies across the continent on bizarre missions. The recordings they gathered include Gibraltarian monkeys, a trumpet being deep-fried, a swimmer crossing the English Channel, and someone dismantling a Ford Fiesta. Two minutes into opener \u201cA Devotion Upon Emergent Occasions,\u201d a medieval chant gets ambushed by a roaring motor and mighty crash: The sound of a 180-year-old German pine tree being felled with a chainsaw during Brexit. (He\u2019s also recorded a companion album documenting every second of the tree\u2019s final week, reasoning , \u201cI'd rather listen to a tree than [Brexit ringleader] Boris Johnson.\u201d) Together these contextual flourishes conjure a great sprawl of humor and tragedy that makes for Herbert\u2019s richest album in years.\nThat\u2019s not to say it goes down easily. A hostile environment of dread and paranoia lasts through the opening songs and well into track three, when keys roll in and a spotlight falls on guest vocalist Rahel Debebe-Dessalegne. She sighs the song\u2019s title, \u201cYou\u2019re Welcome Here,\u201d and the album softens: From then on, The State Between Us provides a balm to the dispossessed. To submit to the dreamlike record is to wend through cities and centuries, big-band ballads and avant-classical curveballs. Interpolating text from a Caryl Churchill play, \u201cThe Special Relationship\u201d unfurls like contemporary opera, with Arto Lindsay yelling \u201cCatastrophe!\u201d and \u201cCunt!\u201d in character as the British and American governments. More than an hour in, \u201cWhere\u2019s Home?\u201d busts out the first dance beat: a carnivalesque house squall.\n\u201cFish and Chips,\u201d with its cantankerous rhythms and triumphal brass, is similarly euphoric, though once you consider the title, which evokes a British innocence that now feels vaguely ironic, it begins to sound less like a carnival than a wake. In this spirit of national reckoning, Herbert rummages deep in the British psyche and pulls out an unlikely cover of Glenn Miller\u2019s \u201cMoonlight Serenade.\u201d This wartime classic has a Proustian significant to many Brits that is rivaled only by the Coronation Street theme and the smell of Battenberg. Yet Herbert, with his usual sledgehammer symbolism, conscripts a German big band to perform it. He aims for your gut, where so much of the avant-garde can\u2019t reach, and rarely misses.\nAt two hours long, The State Between Us ought to waver in focus or intensity, but Herbert has never sounded more at home. Safe in the knowledge that most British people, for better or worse, can\u2019t help but engage with the subject, he taps into a small, honest hope that would be inexplicable as a thinkpiece. On \u201cYou\u2019re Welcome Here,\u201d for instance, Debebe-Dessalegne sings, \u201cWe can stay here in the music,\u201d while an angelic choir serves as propaganda for the redeeming qualities of community. Like a sardonic opera, Herbert\u2019s grand vision could easily live on as a post-colonial, anti-nationalist allegory. Yet it\u2019s just as reassuring to imagine that, one day, Brexit\u2019s toxic memory will fade, his field recordings will lose all poignancy, and the trees will again sound just like trees, nothing more and nothing less.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matthew herbert big band", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "herbert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew herbert", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T09:56:24.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c835ca31cd909bb65602103f7df761fd3f22e431", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gbp-usd-price-forecast-british-163121386.html", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://finance.yahoo.com/currency-converter", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo Finance - Business Finance, Stock Market, Quotes, News", "title": "GBP/USD Price Forecast \u2013 British pound shoot higher to kick off week", "title_full": "GBP/USD Price Forecast \u2013 British pound shoot higher to kick off week", "published": "2019-04-02T00:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.023, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KvSYBW014d4Ouk9WQWg8tQ--~B/aD0zODk7dz02MzA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/fx_empire_176/39c8dec18ef906022874b8b484cbdcfd", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c835ca31cd909bb65602103f7df761fd3f22e431", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gbp-usd-price-forecast-british-163121386.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FX Empire", "published": "2019-04-02T00:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "GBP/USD Price Forecast \u2013 British pound shoot higher to kick off week", "text": "The British pound rallied significantly during the trading session on Monday, testing the highs from the Friday candle rather early during the day as we continue to see a lot of consolidation in a market that of course has been very noisy. After all, we still have plenty of headlines out there when it comes to the Brexit, which continue to be very difficult to follow.\nGBP/USD Video 02.04.19 All that being said, it looks as if the 1.30 level is a crucial support level, and the recent action has certainly panned out that way. The 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level since there, and of course we have seen a couple of bounces. However, to the upside we see a lot of resistance at the 1.3350 level, which of course being broken to the upside could open the doors to the 1.35 handle rather quickly, perhaps even changing the overall trend even further than we have seen as of late. Remember, we broke above a major downtrend line, bounced off of it, and have been consolidating since that move.\nWith all that being said, I think that the British pound is in the process of finding its legs for a longer-term move to the upside. These are always messy and noisy affairs, and difficult to trade. Because of this, it will take a certain amount of patience and a whole lot of belief. If we do break down below the 1.30 level, then the market will probably look to \u201creset\u201d down at the 1.28 level underneath.\nPlease let us know what you think in the comments below\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\nMore From FXEMPIRE: USD/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 US dollar chops on Monday against yen EUR/USD Price Forecast \u2013 Euro bounces for major support level NZD/USD is Bearish as Long as Two POC Zones Hold The Resistance GBP/USD Price Forecast \u2013 British pound shoot higher to kick off week Natural Gas Price Forecast \u2013 Natural gas markets rally to kick off week Gold Price Prediction \u2013 Prices Move Sideways on Mixed Data", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/_pulRRjIU9Q?feature=oembed", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/gold-price-prediction-prices-move-sideways-on-mixed-data-565645", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/gbp-usd-price-forecast-british-pound-shoot-higher-to-kick-off-week-565599&quot;", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/nzd-usd-is-bearish-as-long-as-two-poc-zones-hold-the-resistance-565585", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/usd-jpy-price-forecast-us-dollar-chops-on-monday-against-yen-565602", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/gbp-usd/overview", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/natural-gas-price-forecast-natural-gas-markets-rally-to-kick-off-week-565608", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/eur-usd-price-forecast-euro-bounces-for-major-support-level-565593", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/gbp-usd/overview&quot;", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/gbp-usd-price-forecast-british-pound-shoot-higher-to-kick-off-week-565599"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T09:57:59.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "22730622da38c3028edd17f6601bd1fbb3276ee7", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eur-usd-price-forecast-euro-162903222.html", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://finance.yahoo.com/currency-converter", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo Finance - Business Finance, Stock Market, Quotes, News", "title": "EUR/USD Price Forecast \u2013 Euro bounces for major support level", "title_full": "EUR/USD Price Forecast \u2013 Euro bounces for major support level", "published": "2019-04-02T00:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.773, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rdEy6higtytG7dGUpxwUCQ--~B/aD00MjE7dz02MzA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/fx_empire_176/e98fbdc8dd471b72d571e965b2d447ea", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "22730622da38c3028edd17f6601bd1fbb3276ee7", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eur-usd-price-forecast-euro-162903222.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FX Empire", "published": "2019-04-02T00:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "EUR/USD Price Forecast \u2013 Euro bounces for major support level", "text": "The Euro found the 1.12 level to be massive support yet again, as we bounced during early trading on Monday. The market of course is going to struggle as there are a lot of problems in the European Union currently, but the reality is that economic numbers on the United States are slowing down as well, so it\u2019s difficult to imagine a situation where there will be enough excitement to send the US dollar into a frenzy. Quite frankly, we are getting to the point where we are starting to see significant concerns with both economies, and therefore it\u2019s very likely that we will stay within the range that we have carved out as of late.\nEUR USD Forecast Video 02.04.19 While the 1.12 level underneath is massive support, you have to keep in mind that the 1.15 level above is massive resistance. With that being the situation we find ourselves in, and the fact that we are so significantly obvious as far as our range, so at this point I\u2019m a buyer here and then I would take profit somewhere closer to the 1.1450 level which is the beginning of massive resistance. Looking at this chart, there is most certainly more risk to the upside then down.\nHowever, if we did break down below the area around the 1.12 level, the market could very well find itself into a freefall down to the 1.10 level. However, so far it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s a serious threat, so it\u2019s likely this bounce should lead to a longer-term trade to the upside.\nPlease let us know what you think in the comments below\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\nMore From FXEMPIRE: GBP/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 British pound rallies to kick off the week USD/CAD Daily Price Forecast \u2013 Canadian Loonie Holds Fort On Weak Crude Oil Silver Price Forecast \u2013 Silver markets looking for a floored Gold Price Forecast \u2013 Gold markets looking for buyers E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM) Futures Technical Analysis \u2013 Needs to Hold 26145 to Sustain Rally Natural Gas Price Prediction \u2013 Prices Rebound but Remain Rangebound", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/natural-gas-price-prediction-prices-rebound-but-remain-rangebound-2-565648", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/usd-cad-daily-price-forecast-canadian-loonie-holds-fort-on-weak-crude-oil-565644", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/gold-price-forecast-gold-markets-looking-for-buyers-565605", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/e-mini-dow-jones-industrial-average-ym-futures-technical-analysis-needs-to-hold-26145-to-sustain-rally-565535", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/eur-usd/overview&quot;", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/gUJJiqzF3BY?feature=oembed", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/silver-price-forecast-silver-markets-looking-for-a-floored-565614", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/eur-usd/overview", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/eur-usd-price-forecast-euro-bounces-for-major-support-level-565593", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/eur-usd-price-forecast-euro-bounces-for-major-support-level-565593&quot;", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/gbp-jpy-price-forecast-british-pound-rallies-to-kick-off-the-week-565596"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T09:58:56.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ad7dda7b4896b5411159151c38a2619a9737ae07", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nzd-usd-bearish-long-two-162008315.html", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://finance.yahoo.com/currency-converter", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo Finance - Business Finance, Stock Market, Quotes, News", "title": "NZD/USD is Bearish as Long as Two POC Zones Hold The Resistance", "title_full": "NZD/USD is Bearish as Long as Two POC Zones Hold The Resistance", "published": "2019-04-02T00:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.484, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9JZKwzCbfSjGuy_OiuhhlA--~B/aD00MTc7dz02MzA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/fx_empire_176/da52ac98cab8b95b634091e0407a103f", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ad7dda7b4896b5411159151c38a2619a9737ae07", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nzd-usd-bearish-long-two-162008315.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FX Empire", "published": "2019-04-02T00:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "NZD/USD is Bearish as Long as Two POC Zones Hold The Resistance", "text": "Dear Traders,\nThe NZD/USD is still in downtrend.

Skirts , they said, were uncomfortable and restrictive. They wanted to be free to play at recess, do cartwheels with the boys and to focus on learning in the classroom - not the position of their legs.\nSo the girls, then ages 5, 10 and 14, decided to do something about it. What began with a school petition by one of the students seeking to allow girls to wear pants to school stretched into a years-long battle that culminated last week when a federal judge struck down the school's uniform policy as unconstitutional. \"The skirts requirement causes the girls to suffer a burden the boys do not, simply because they are female,\" judge Malcolm Howard wrote in the ruling, filed on Thursday.\nThe ruling landed amid a larger discussion about how female students of all ages are viewed, after recent episodes at other schools. Students at the University of Notre Dame wore leggings last week to protest a letter to the editor in the student newspaper that urged female students not to wear the form-fitting pants because they invite men to look at their bodies. And an article in the Washington Post about a Maryland high school, where girls fought back against a list ranking female students by their attractiveness, inspired a reflection on how similar lists have proliferated in schools for years.\nFor the girls at Charter Day School, a tuition-free charter school of 900 students in Leland, North Carolina, near Wilmington, the issue was equality. Girls were required to wear skirts, jumpers or skorts, which look like a skirt but include shorts-like fabric underneath. Boys, on the other hand, were required to wear pants or shorts. Keely Burks, one of the students involved, was in eighth grade when the American Civil Liberties Union filed the suit on behalf of the girls and their guardians in 2016. In a blog post at the time, she described how \"distracting and uncomfortable\" it was to have to pay attention to the position of her legs while sitting in class.\nThe school, which opened in 2000, aimed to foster a culture that preserved \"chivalry and respect\" among students, Baker Mitchell, founder of the company that oversees Charter Day, wrote in an email to a parent about the uniform policy in 2015. In a statement on Sunday, Mitchell said: \"The Charter Day School Board is analysing the opinion and will be meeting with counsel in the very near future to discuss their options moving forward.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "http://toi.in/WiWCRb"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "malcolm howard", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of notre dame", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T10:01:49.120+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ec95ad4b7355a638ad4cb4bb71f882ba6e132531", "url": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-04/02/c_137941482.htm", "site_full": "www.xinhuanet.com", "site": "xinhuanet.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["travel"], "section_title": "", "title": "GAC Group reports over 50-bln-USD annual revenue in 2018 - Xinhua | English.news.cn", "title_full": "GAC Group reports over 50-bln-USD annual revenue in 2018 - Xinhua | English.news.cn", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 74, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ec95ad4b7355a638ad4cb4bb71f882ba6e132531", "url": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-04/02/c_137941482.htm", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "GAC Group reports over 50-bln-USD annual revenue in 2018 - Xinhua | English.news.cn", "text": "GAC Group reports over 50-bln-USD annual revenue in 2018 Source: Xinhua | 2019-04-02 01:12:42 | Editor: Mu Xuequan Video Player Close\nGUANGZHOU, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese automaker Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.

The sales growth was about 10 percentage points higher than the industry average, and its market share increased to about 7.65 percent.\n\"The sales of our own brand vehicles have exceeded 500,000 for two consecutive years,\" said Zeng Qinghong, chairman of GAC Group, adding that the group's joint venture brands have also maintained steady and fast growth.

This year is shaping up to be the worst year for measles since at least 2014. New York's Rockland County bans unvaccinated children from public places. Measles continues to spread across the U.S., with outbreaks in four states infecting more people in the first three months of 2019 than in all of last year, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe CDC has confirmed 387 cases across 15 states from Jan. 1 through March 28, compared with 372 cases in all of last year. The health agency updates the statistics weekly. There are now six outbreaks, defined as three or more cases, across four states: New York, Washington, New Jersey and California, according to the CDC.\nThis year is shaping up to be the worst year for measles since at least 2014 and is already the second-worst since the virus was declared eradicated from the U.S. in 2000. Measles has been making a comeback as parents increasingly refuse to vaccinate their children and unvaccinated travelers bring back the disease from other countries. In 2014, there were 667 confirmed cases, according to the CDC.\nNew York's Rockland County last week took the extraordinary step of banning unvaccinated children from public places such as schools, restaurants, malls and places of worship. There have been 157 confirmed cases of measles in the county, and the overwhelming majority of those people had not received the vaccine, according to the county.\nCheryl Healton, dean of New York University's College of Global Public Health, said she has some sympathy for the county health department in taking this action. However, she worries it could embolden parents who refuse to have their children vaccinated, known as anti-vaxxers.\n\"It's a carrot or a stick. They chose the stick. There's a lot of evidence the carrot works better than when you use the stick, that's why it's not used. You can get a better response by appealing to people's higher nature,\" she said.\nThe MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella, is the best way to protect against measles. Two doses, the recommended amount, provides 97 percent protection against measles. Yet some parents refuse to vaccinate their children, citing religious reasons or false information that vaccines cause autism.\nMeasles is highly contagious, infecting up to 90 percent of unvaccinated people who are exposed to it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus can live in the air for up to two hours after an infected person coughs or sneezes, according to the CDC, meaning people can be exposed to it without ever knowing. People can be infected for days before showing signs of the virus, such as a fever, runny nose or a rash.\nMeasles can be especially dangerous for young children, the CDC says. It can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and even death. The CDC recommends children get their first dose of MMR vaccine at between 12 and 15 months old and a second dose when they're between 4 and 6 years old.\nThe CDC says the current measles outbreaks in the U.S. are mostly linked to people traveling internationally to countries such as Israel and Ukraine that are experiencing large outbreaks. It's spreading quickly in close-knit religious communities, such as New York's Orthodox Jewish community, where many people choose not to get vaccinated.\nPublic health officials are desperately trying to assure parents that vaccines are safe and are the best way to protect their children from dangerous and potentially deadly diseases such as measles.

Did it outsource too much of the certification process to Boeing itself, putting as one senator expressed it, \"the fox in charge of the hen house\"?\nGlobal regulators have said they won't take the FAA's word for it when they re-certify the aircraft, instead conducting their own full, independent process.\nThis is a departure from the norm in a world where the FAA has long been considered the gold standard, and it may not have happened had the regulator been quicker off the mark.\nNow, as the world awaits the preliminary accident report from the recent Ethiopian Airlines crash, Boeing continues to refuse to supply spokespeople and executives for interviews. The aviation firm says it is trying to restore faith in the industry and that it is committed to regaining public trust.\nThere have been plenty of helpful background briefings, numerous vague written statements, and one earnest recorded message to camera from its CEO.\nBut in an age where customers expect a flow of information and authentic real time responses, Boeing keeps missing its chance to communicate with the flying public in a pro-active and courageous way.\nA number of employees from prominent aviation companies have told me of their frustration about this silent and secretive approach.\nAnd so in the vacuum of its own making, every nut and bolt of Boeing's process is being raked over. Image: Boeing insisted the plane was safe, before grounding them to apply software updates\nA law suit has been filed by the family of a victim of the Ethiopian Airlines crash.\nIt alleges that Boeing made errors on its initial safety assessment of the MAX.\nIt says that the \"accident occurred because, among other things, Boeing defectively designed a new flight control system for the Boeing 737 MAX 8 that automatically and erroneously pushes the aircraft's nose down, and because Boeing failed to warn of the defect.\"\nBoeing denies this.\nBut there is an awful lot on the line for the world's largest commercial plane manufacturer, and its counterparts at the FAA. Image: There is an awful lot on the line for the world\u2019s largest commercial plane manufacturer\nI'm pleased, if you can use that word in such awful circumstances, that they failed to get their response right.\nThat failure resulted in real scrutiny of the way the MAX was made, and how it came to be in our skies.\nIt resulted in people thinking again about the safety of a transport mode that we take utterly for granted.\nIt may also result in accountability.\nAnd for the flying public, that's a very, very good thing.

Share Via Email Published: 02nd April 2019 11:08 AM | Last Updated: 02nd April 2019 11:08 AM | A+ A A- For representational purposes By PTI WASHINGTON: Three Indian-origin consultants have been charged in the US with visa fraud for allegedly submitting sham applications for H-1B visas to gain a competitive advantage over competing firms.\nA federal grand jury last month indicted Kishore Dattapuram, of Santa Clara, Kumar Aswapathi, of Austin, Texas, and Santosh Giri, of San Jose, on 10 counts of substantive visa fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud, the Justice Department said in a statement.\nThe H-1B visa programme allows foreign workers to obtain temporary authorisation to live and work for employers in the United States.\nIn order to secure an H-1B visa, an employer or other sponsor must submit an 'I-129' petition to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.\nA petition and associated documentation must confirm the existence and duration of the job waiting for the worker, and describe key details including the wages associated with the position.\nAccording to the eight-page indictment, Dattapuram, 49, Aswapathi, 49, and Giri, 42 operated Nanosemantics, Inc, a Santa Clara-based consulting firm whose services included placing skilled foreign workers at software and technology companies in the Bay Area.\nThey worked together to submit fraudulent H-1B visa applications on behalf of foreign workers in order to gain a competitive advantage over competing firms.\nThe defendants allegedly used Nanosemantics to submit fraudulent I-129 petitions and obtain H-1B visas for workers that the defendants could later place at local companies.\nBy maintaining a group of available workers, the defendants would gain a competitive advantage over consultants that properly applied for paperwork only after matching a qualified worker to and available job.\nAccording to the indictment, several of the I-129 petitions submitted by defendants stated that particular workers had specific jobs waiting for them at designated companies when, in reality, the defendants knew that these jobs did not exist.\nFurther, the defendants allegedly sought the cooperation of third parties to conceal their fraud.\nFor example, defendants allegedly orchestrated payments by Nanosemantics to at least one individual for permission to list his company as the employer for foreign workers even though Nanosemantics actually intended to place the workers elsewhere.\nFurther, defendants allegedly coached foreign workers and others, to respond to government inquiries in a way that would prevent the government from discovering the fraud.\nThe defendants were charged with one count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud and ten counts of substantive visa fraud.\nThe defendants were arrested last week in their respective towns of residence.\nAll three defendants entered pleas of not guilty and were released on bonds.\nThey are next scheduled to appear on May 13, 2019, for a status conference before Judge Edward J Davila, US District Judge.\nIf convicted, the defendants face a maximum sentence of ten years, and a fine of USD 250,000, plus restitution if appropriate for each violation.

On Monday Burger King and Silicon Valley startup Impossible Foods announced the rollout of the Impossible Whopper in 59 stores in and around St. Louis, Missouri.\nTo mark the launch on April Fool's day, the burger giant released a hidden-camera-style promo video showing the serving of plant-based Whoppers instead of meat to customers who marvel that they cannot tell the difference.\n\"We wanted to make sure we had something that lived up to the expectations of the Whopper,\" said Burger King's North America president, Christopher Finazzo. \"We've done sort of a blind taste test with our franchisees, with people in the office, with my partners on the executive team, and virtually nobody can tell the difference.\"\nThe Impossible Whopper comes at an extra cost - about a dollar more than the beef patty Whopper. But Finazzo said research shows consumers are willing to pay more for the plant-based burger. Read also Impossible foods in Singapore: does it taste like real meat?\nPlant-based meat substitutes have been gaining popularity as more attention is focused on the environmental hazards of industrial ranching. Finazzo said his research shows customers mainly like it for the health benefits. The Impossible Burger patty has zero cholesterol.\nImpossible Foods, based in Redwood City, California, launched its first faux meat patty over two years ago. A genetically modified yeast creates the key ingredient, called heme, which makes the patties appear to bleed and taste like real meat.\nBurger King is not the first to serve up a no-meat burger. Los Angeles-based Beyond Meat in early January announced it was rolling out its plant-based burger at fast-food chain Carl's Jr. Beyond Meat counts actor Leonardo DiCaprio and Microsoft founder Bill Gates as investors. It filed for an initial public offering in November.\nFinazzo said Burger King also researched Beyond Meat, but decided that Impossible Foods', which also counts Gates as an investor, offering was a better fit. \"Around the taste, around the brand recognition, around the price, all those things were important factors in choosing Impossible,\" he said.\nImpossible Foods tailored a patty specifically for the Whopper, Chief Executive Pat Brown said. The Impossible Taste Test | Impossible Whopper\n\"We're now in well over 6,000 restaurants. If the Burger King launch is as successful as I expect it to be, and we go nationwide, that will add more than 7,000 restaurants that serve the Impossible Burger,\" Brown said.\nImpossible also counts Google Ventures, Khosla Ventures, Horizons Ventures and Singapore-based investment firm Temasek as investors. Impossible has been making inroads in Asia as well.\nLast year total US retail sales of plant-based meat substitutes grew over 23 per cent to exceed $760 million, according to Nielsen sales data analysed by The Good Food Institute, a non-profit promoting plant-based alternatives to animal products.\nBurger King rivals, food conglomerates and meat packers are cooking up more plant-based burgers. McDonald's Corp., the world's biggest fast-food chain, sells soy-based burgers in Finland and Sweden. Tyson Foods has a stake in Beyond Meat.\nNestle S.A. is planning to debut its \"Incredible Burger\" soon in Europe. Unilever Plc late last year announced its acquisition of The Vegetarian Butcher to build out its plant-based portfolio.

Manufacturing has emerged as a huge challenge for the booming industry because these products are so new and complex.\nTo treat a devastating rare disease, the biotech AveXis designed a medicine that would deliver a working gene into the body and counter the steady, worsening muscle deterioration that is the disease's hallmark.\nSound mind-boggling? Imagine trying to actually manufacture it. AveXis's specialty is this type of \" gene therapy ,\" a promising area that has the potential as a long-term treatment, or perhaps even a cure.\nBut manufacturing these complex and very new products has also presented a tremendous challenge for biopharmaceutical companies, and threatens to shape the contours of this emerging industry.\nAveXis has solved that, Chief Scientific Officer Brian Kaspar told Business Insider in an interview, and it drove the company's nearly $9 billion takeover by a big pharma company last year.\n\"It was one of the reasons that Novartis came in and acquired us , because we did figure out. And I think it was unique,\" Kaspar said.\nRead: Billions of dollars are pouring into gene-therapy startups. Top execs at 3 companies described the biggest challenge the new field faces. What a burgeoning field 'doesn't necessarily appreciate'\nTo make the kinds of powerful and precise genetic changes needed to treat inherited diseases, AveXis and other companies use viruses as a delivery vehicle. Depending on what condition they're for, some gene therapies hone in on a very specific part of the body, like the eye .\nBut an eye treatment calls for much less virus than AveXis's Zolgensma , which is injected into the fluid around the spine and brain to treat the rare genetic disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).\nZolgensma hasn't yet been approved in the US, but a decision from the Food and Drug Administration is expected in May.\nSee: The FDA's top official overseeing gene therapy had these 5 suggestions for startups flooding into the billion-dollar industry\nCompanies have to make enough of their gene therapies to test them out, and get enough evidence that they are safe and work. But they also have to be able to manufacture on a large-enough scale to treat all the patients with the disease who want their treatment.\nAnd changing the process at that point \"could change the product,\" Kaspar said, \"something the field doesn't necessarily appreciate.\" A laboratory staff works at the industrial platform of YposKesi , the first French industrial pharmaceutical company producing gene and cell therapy drugs for rare diseases on November 17, 2016 in Evry, near Paris. The AFM-Telethon, which was created 58 years ago, started a lab of gene therapy Genethon Bioprod in 2013 in the scientific park of the Genopole of Ivry. The Telethon will take place on December 2 and 3, 2016. ERIC PIERMONT/AFP/Getty Images How AveXis did it\nKaspar has worked for much of his career on viruses and their use in gene therapy, including 13 years spent researching them at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Ohio. In 2012, he started at AveXis as a scientific founder.\nBut that academic work hadn't been at quite the commercial scale that AveXis would need. So the company hired experts, starting with industry veteran Andrew Knudten, who is now AveXis's senior vice president of global strategic operations.\nKnudten's background was in pharmaceuticals manufacturing, though not specifically in the type of gene therapies that AveXis was developing. He built out a team of engineers with expertise in a type of complex medicines called biologics (which includes vaccines and many other common drugs), and they worked with Kaspar's group closely.\nCombining the different types of science proved fruitful, Kaspar said. He had been confronting problems like, for example, \"how do we grow cells at a bigger and longer level\" and \"I can move 10 liters but this process is going to use thousands of liters.\"\n\"Well these people said, 'That's not a problem, Brian,\" Kaspar said. \" So the things that we had academically almost as a challenge, someone else had figured those things out. But in a different setting.\"\nBut Kaspar doesn't recommend other companies follow the exact same approach. For one thing, AveXis hasn't disclosed their process, he said.\nAnd there also isn't a \"one-size-fits-all,\" according to Kaspar. It depends on what disease one is tackling and how large the patient population is, for example - the technology might not have to evolve in a rare eye disease.\n\"So just because we have figured it out in one way or the analytics, people have to go out and really develop it on their own,\" he said. \"And there's no off-the-shelf solution for most of these diseases.\" Read more:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.avexis.com", "http://exslt.org/strings", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-knudten-63996/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "avexis", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "hollis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian kaspar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "novartis", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "emma court apr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T11:03:33.063+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5ca372bdca963d478d749ff93bb3b510a31a7e39", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/s-p-500-would-ve-made-indians-richer-rather-than-soaring-sensex-1554151144416.html", "site_full": "www.livemint.com", "site": "livemint.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "US stocks would\u2019ve made Indians richer rather than soaring Sensex", "title_full": "US stocks would\u2019ve made Indians richer rather than soaring Sensex", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.011, "main_image": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2019/04/01/600x338/M2M-Sensex-Nifty_1554152105467.JPG", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4429, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 8, "comments": 1, "shares": 5}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5ca372bdca963d478d749ff93bb3b510a31a7e39", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/s-p-500-would-ve-made-indians-richer-rather-than-soaring-sensex-1554151144416.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Clifford Alvares", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "US stocks would\u2019ve made Indians richer rather than soaring Sensex", "text": "US stocks would\u2019ve made Indians richer rather than soaring Sensex 2 min read . Updated: 02 Apr 2019, 02:28 AM IST Clifford Alvares A key reason why the S&P 500 index outclassed the Sensex is the depreciation in rupee S&P 500 consists of a variety of investment themes that are not listed on Sensex Share Via S&P 500 Sensex Stock Markets\nYou may have heard of reverse brain drain. From the looks of it, it may well be time for a reversal in the nature of capital flows as well. Traditionally, investors in developed markets have chased assets in developing economies such as India for higher returns. And while there have been provisions for Indian investors to invest in assets of developed markets, hardly anyone has taken advantage of those opportunities.\nBut as it turns out, Indian investors would have been better off investing in US stocks in the past decade. The S&P 500 has beaten India\u2019s Nifty 500 index in the last 10 years after accounting for the depreciation in the rupee.\nSo, while the Sensex may have reached touching distance of the 40,000-mark, returns from the Indian markets haven\u2019t been all that impressive, when seen in relation to the S&P 500 index, which is made up of the world\u2019s largest corporations.\nAn investment in the S&P 500 index grew at an annual average rate of 17.11% in rupee terms in the past decade. By comparison, the Nifty 500 index delivered returns of 15.46%, shows a Mint study.\nTwo things emerge when one scrutinizes the performances. The US market has been in the midst of the longest bull market in its history, despite Indian markets offering ample opportunities for domestic investors. The S&P 500 in dollar terms has, in the past decade, grown an annual 13.51%, thanks in part to the expanding US economy. But a key reason why the S&P 500 index outclasses the Indian market is the Indian currency\u2019s depreciation. In the last decade, the rupee has depreciated approximately 37% against the dollar.\nSecond, the US market has some global companies and other internet and IT themes such as the Alphabets and Facebooks of the world, that are not listed in India. Many of these themes have had a good run in the last decade, leading to a strong performance in the US market.\nWhile currency risks can work both ways, over a long term, emerging market currencies have generally depreciated.\nHaving said all this, note that the Indian market has fared better over a three-year and a five-year period. And like investment advisers always say, \u201cPast performance is not a guide for future performance.\"\nGlobal market dynamics can also change, and factors such as geopolitical risks also tend to influence market returns. \u201cIt\u2019s only when the global economy does well that the situation does not seem in our favour. If the Indian economy does well and the rupee shows strength, Indian market returns can be much better, both in the long and short run,\" said a mutual fund manager.\nBut, in the end analysis, it does look like it\u2019s time more Indians considered the option of diversifying to assets outside the country.

She said her vows outside under a wooden veranda, dressed in a lilac gown, wearing a tiara, with her hair curled gently around her face. Her dad made a speech wishing the happy couple luck. But Heather was only 15 when she said \"I do\". She was also pregnant.\nThe groom, Aaron, was 24 when they married in August 2015. Heather's mum had been against the marriage from the start, but her dad and paternal grandparents, who Heather lived with, believed the unborn child's parents should be married, and so researched states in which it was legal for a 15-year-old to marry with only one parent's consent. They also thought that, by marrying, Aaron could avoid a charge of statutory rape and possible prison sentence.\nA new BBC Three documentary investigates what happens when the law allows young people under the age of consent to marry, as well as the parents who allow this to happen.\nSex in most states in the US is illegal under the age of 16-18. But, as of January 2019, 17 American states have no legal minimum age for marriage providing certain conditions \u2013 like pregnancy, and consent from a judge or family \u2013 are met. This means that, with parental permission, girls as young as 12 can be legally wed to men much older than they are \u2013 but only if they\u2019re pregnant.\nKeri, from South Carolina, was a teenager when she married a man almost a decade older. BBC Three Keri and Paul in 2013\nShe met Paul, 24, at a party on her 15th birthday back in 2013. They slept together just once \u2013 and Keri became pregnant.\n\"It was [Paul\u2019s] idea to get married. So that he didn\u2019t go to jail for statutory rape,\" she says. Keri's dad's consent was needed for them to marry, and he gave it when Paul asked. In photos taken of the couple a week before the wedding, the braces on Keri\u2019s teeth are clearly visible. She says she had them on her wedding day. BBC Three Keri, while pregnant with Paul's child, poses with Paul\nShe admits that her home life with her dad was deeply unhappy, and she took a gamble on a life with Paul in a new home being better. \"I just couldn\u2019t handle it no more,\" she says. Looking back, she thinks the law that allowed her to marry Paul is \"stupid\".\n\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right. You should stay a child for as long as you can.\"\nShe adds that she wishes she'd finished school \u2013\"You can\u2019t even get a job at McDonald\u2019s without getting a high-school diploma\"\u2013 and that her marriage to Paul was \"horrible\", with him treating her \"like a maid\". BBC Three Keri feels she missed out on her childhood\nKeri is now 21, and lives with her new husband, Mason, and has three kids \u2013 one is from that first marriage, which lasted about two years.\nBBC Three reached out to contact Keri\u2019s dad about why he consented to letting a 24-year-old man marry his 15-year-old daughter, but there was no reply.\nJournalist and presenter Ellie Flynn met Paul to hear his side of the story. In South Carolina, it\u2019s illegal for anyone over the age of 18 to have sex with someone below 16. Paul says he thought Keri was 18 when they met \u2013 because she had a \"good fake\" ID, despite looking very young. He denies being a paedophile, which some people have called him. \"I'm not attracted to teenage girls,\" he says. Before long, the police started investigating him for statutory rape, after a social worker who'd been visiting Keri caught wind of the relationship. BBC Three Paul says he and Keri were 'in love'\nPaul admits he married her to avoid a rape charge. He believes that him being in jail while Keri was pregnant \"wouldn't have helped her\".\n\"[Keri\u2019s] dad didn\u2019t take much convincing. He\u2019s a great guy, but he likes to drink.\"\nDoes Paul have any regrets? \"No, because we were in love. Yes, she was 15 and I was 24. But I\u2019ve always said, follow your heart, because love comes in all shapes, sizes and ages.\"\nA nonprofit organisation which helps women who were married as children estimated that 248,000 \u2013 including girls as young as 12 \u2013 were married in the US between 2000 and 2010. It\u2019s only in the last two years that 10 states have tightened their marriage laws, implementing minimum ages of between 16 and 18 and limits on the age gap between those getting married. But only Delaware and New Jersey have banned child marriage outright, with no exceptions. BBC Three Zion and baby Issac\nZion lives in Georgia, and says her life would be very different if the law was changed to make it illegal to marry under the age of 18. She met David in high school when she was 14 and he was 16. She was 15 when she became pregnant with baby Isaac. Georgia's age of consent is 16, but when both parties are under 18 and the age gap is less than four years, it is not considered in law as statutory rape, so David had not committed an offence.\nThe couple married when Zion was 16 and David 18 \u2013 an important step because of David\u2019s job in the military. They were only allowed to live together where he was stationed if they were husband and wife. \"My relationship was saved by being able to get married at a young age,\" she says. It required the consent of both her parents to be able to marry the father of her child. BBC Three Zion and David getting married\nWhy did her mum, Michelle, say yes to marriage for her teenage daughter? \"A child deserves to have both of their parents,\" she says. \"Their baby\u2019s needs are more important than their needs.\" If David had been older, Michelle believes she would still have accepted the union: \"I\u2019d still have thought that marriage was the best option.\"\nZion\u2019s teen marriage to the man who got her pregnant was a different situation to Keri\u2019s, and her future looks hopeful. But tragically, this is not always the case.\nHeather, now 18, met Aaron when he was staying in a trailer outside her grandparent's house in Idaho. BBC Three Heather remembers her dad taking her to marry Aaron\n\"I got drunk and woke up in a trailer with him,\" she says. \"I asked him what happened. He said we had sex. I knew he took advantage of me, but I really didn\u2019t want to admit that I was raped.\"\nHeather was \"terrified\" when she found out she was pregnant. Her mum called the police and pressed charges. But Heather\u2019s dad wanted to keep Aaron out of jail and by her side.\nHeather was presented with a list of options: \"My grandad said we could run away to Canada. Mom suggested I could get an abortion. Dad suggested I should get married... according to my dad, when you get somebody pregnant, you marry them.\"\nHeather\u2019s dad drove for two days straight to Missouri, where girls are able to marry at 15 with the consent of only one parent. \"It wasn\u2019t something I wanted to do,\" Heather says, admitting that she knew she was having a \"really shitty wedding\". But she soon \"went from being scared, not knowing what to do, to knowing we could raise a baby together and I wouldn\u2019t have to do it by myself. That was a big relief.\" In the end, Heather miscarried the baby. BBC Three Heather and Aaron shortly after getting married\nHeather's mum was pursuing the rape charges, as the offence that Aaron was being reported for had taken place before the wedding. After just four months of marriage, Heather's husband was behind bars. Aaron pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 15 years. He and Heather's dad had thought marriage would protect him from legal action, but as Officer Greg Griffel, who led the case, explains: \"That [marriage] doesn\u2019t change anything, the crime was still committed whether they were married or not.\"\nAaron had to serve three years before being eligible for parole, and was released in January 2019.\nHeather has always feared his release. \"How will he react to me moving on and living my life and having a family now?\" she asks, holding the baby she's since had with her new partner. \"He\u2019ll see it as me leaving him to rot. He\u2019s a very angry person who holds grudges.\"\nHer fear of Aaron led her to take drastic precautions. \"We both decided it was a good idea to get a handgun. I\u2019m not going to live in fear of [Aaron] coming back. If he came anywhere near me or my daughter, I\u2019d shoot him.\" BBC Three Heather shows Ellie the gun she owns to protect her and her baby\nAaron wasn't the only man the police pursued. They believed Heather's dad Keith to be an \"accessory to rape\" for his role in facilitating their wedding.\n\"What shocked me the most is the fact her father didn\u2019t come forward to seek help from law enforcement,\" says Officer Griffel. \"I asked Keith about that and he said, 'We\u2019re religious people and we don\u2019t believe in our child growing up without a father'. But he raped your daughter. They felt they were doing the right thing for [Heather] and for her baby. But the damage that it did to Heather\u2026 this will affect her for the rest of her life.\"\n\"Now that I look back on it, my mom was the only person who asked, 'Is this what is best for my daughter?'\" says Heather. \"When literally everyone was against her. That\u2019s the one thing I\u2019m so grateful for.\" BBC Three\n\"My dad got four months. The way the judge put it, he was sentencing him to four months in jail for the four months that I was forced to be married to my rapist. I don\u2019t think he really understood what he did wrong. I felt like I had no choice. And that is one thing that I will always hold against him. I never want my daughter to go through what I had to go through.\"\nBut progress on this issue, however small and hard-won, is being made. On 29 January 2019, the State Senate unanimously passed a bill to end child marriage in South Carolina. Once ratified, the loophole which allowed pregnant girls to be married under the age of 16 will be closed. For some it is too little too late. But it could just make a difference to other young women, who might have the chance of a happier future.\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this piece, you can find more information here.

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 365 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SLV options chain for the new March 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest. The put contract at the $14.00 strike price has a current bid of 74 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $14.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $13.26 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SLV, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $14.19/share today.\nBecause the $14.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.29% return on the cash commitment, or 5.29% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost . Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Ishares Silver Trust, and highlighting in green where the $14.00 strike is located relative to that history: Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $15.00 strike price has a current bid of 92 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of SLV stock at the current price level of $14.19/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $15.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 12.19% if the stock gets called away at the March 2020 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SLV shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Ishares Silver Trust, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SLV's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $15.00 strike highlighted in red:\nConsidering the fact that the $15.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.48% boost of extra return to the investor, or 6.48% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost . The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 20%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $14.19) to be 16%.

Listen\nBy the E ditors at Illustrated Guide for Weapons and Tactics The US military\u2019s FMS process\nThe procurement of weapons is not your run of the mill transaction. There is a strict and official procedure that needs to be followed. If Taiwan is interested in a certain piece of equipment from the United States, for instance, it must first send an LOR (Letter of Request) for the P&A (Price and Availability) data. After the U.S. responds with the initial quote, Taiwan then has to produce a \"Request for a LOA (Letter of Offer and Acceptance),\" before the US officially sends out a \u201cLOA.\u201d\nAccording to the regulations of the U.S. government\u2019s FMS (Foreign Military Sales) , in the first stage, the DOD does not have a definite time limit to respond to the buyer after they receive the \u201cLOR.\u201d However, in the second stage, after receiving the \u201cRequest for a LOA,\u201d they need to make a decision on whether or not to sell within six months.\nIn the 40 years since the severance of Taiwan-U.S. diplomatic relations, the most significant military transaction was when President George H.W. Bush announced the sale of 150 F-16A/B jets in 1992 as he pushed for re-election. When his son, President George W. Bush, was in charge, the U.S. declared their willingness to sell submarines to Taiwan. However, after Taiwan sent out an \u201cLOR,\u201d the transaction was sunk to the bottom of the ocean due to some constraints enforced by the U.S. Department of State. Following that, Taiwan sent another LOR for the then newly developed F-16C/D fighter jets, but yet again, the order did not materialize.\nTherefore, from the beginning of this century, throughout both the Chen Shui-bian (\u9673\u6c34\u6241) and Ma Ying-jeou (\u99ac\u82f1\u4e5d) governments, Taiwan has been pushing to upgrade its relationship with the U.S. to something similar to close-knit allies, so that Taiwan would be able to skip to the second stage of the process and directly propose a \u201cRequest for an LOA\u201d instead, allowing the U.S. executive branch to simply respond before the given deadline. At the end of 2018, after many years of hard work, the U.S. finally agreed to move toward a \u201cmore normal foreign military sales relationship\u201d with Taiwan.\nTherefore, with this current purchase of F-16 jets, the U.S. government must decide whether or not to approve the \u201cRequest for a LOA\u201d within the time limit. If they do agree to it, then the U.S. will sign the LOA before signing contracts with domestic U.S. defense contractors to kick-start production. Fact or fiction: \u2018Spending big on outdated weapons?\u2019\nAfter news broke of the military aircraft procurement, some of the public voiced their opposition over the internet. Among the many voices, there were some who claimed that \u2018the United Kingdom bought 138 of the latest F-35s for only NT$361.9 billion, yet the Tsai [Ing-wen, \u8521\u82f1\u6587] government needed to spend NT$390 billion for 66 20-year-old F-16Vs.\u2019\nIn response this statement, the Ministry of Defense had to release an announcement in order to explain the situation. The total price of the British F-35 procurement was GBP\u00a39.1 billion, which is indeed equivalent to NT$361.9 billion, but the amount purchased was not 138 but rather only 48 jets. In addition, the United Kingdom was one of the countries that participated in the F-35 R&D program and has been involved in its investment since 2001, which means the country\u2019s overall investment for this particular aircraft model is most definitely more than GBP\u00a39.1 billion.\nFurthermore, Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Defense also explained that, at present, Taiwan has only proposed the specifications for a new batch of fighter jets, but there has been no confirmation of which model of fighter jet they would be purchasing. The ministry also emphasized that the \u201cF-16V is not an old aircraft, even though the F-16A / B are,\u201d effectively busting the myth surrounding the controversy.\nAlso, the reason Taiwan is not purchasing the F-35 \u201cLightning II\u201d is very simple\u201d The stealth technology, and its ability to sustain Mach speed for a brief period without the use of an afterburner, are both far too advanced. When the United States started the \"Joint Strike Fighter\" (JSF) program to help develop this aircraft, it considered what Beijing\u2019s reaction would be, so they didn\u2019t even think about inviting Taiwan to participate in the program. Moreover, it is only now that the countries that were involved in the program are starting to receive their shipments to update their squadrons, so even if U.S. President Donald Trump promised to add Taiwan to the waiting list, Taiwan would have to wait well over 10 years for the delivery. With cross-Strait relations as unpredictable as they are, Taiwan just cannot take that risk.\nOn top of this, the biggest threat currently facing Taiwan emerged last year , where the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) with its warplanes and battleships has continued to surround Taiwan\u2019s waters in order to demonstrate their ability to attack from all directions. Prior to this happening, the Taiwanese Armed Forces had always felt that the southeast coast was relatively safe, so the anti-submarine and air transport units are stationed in Pingtung, whereas all the old F-5E/F fighter jets are stationed in Taitung.\nAt the beginning of last year, in one of their drills, the Air Force gave a very \u201cimplicit\u201d hint about their operations, that drill was the military exercise involving Taitung\u2019s 7th Wing, F-5E / F fleet, where during the exercise, two F-16A/B jets from the 4th wing in Chiayi came over the Central Mountain Range and landed at Taitung Airport. After being wheeled into the steel hangers, they were refueled, but no one in the air force battered an eyelid, and the actions of all personnel were very well drilled, which suggested that this sort of cross-regional support had been going on for quite some time.\nHowever, each Air Force base has its own area of patrol that it needs to protect, so if it is necessary for the West Coast fleets to fly over the mountains to support the East Coast regularly, then surely something is wrong and a long-term solution must be found. The 66 new fighter jets purchased this time around are the required number of jets the Air Force Wings need, so we can expect that they will be stationed at the two bases mentioned above in order to bolster Taiwan\u2019s air defense. Credit: Editors at Illustrated Guide for Weapons and Tactics An F-16A fighter jet from Chiayi, which flew over the Central Mountain Range to support Taitung. The difference between the F-16V and F-16A/B\nThe F-16V has actually been appearing in the skies of Taiwan since last year. They are upgraded versions of the F-16A/B that the Taiwanese Armed Forces already owned, but how have these models made such a big jumped from the letters A/B to V? Well, the letters signify something other than upgraded releases.\nIn the U.S. military, the letters found after the model number usually represent what modifications the aircraft has been released with, and as the F-16 has been in production for 40 years, there have been numerous upgrades and modifications \u2013 so many that the 26 letters in the English alphabet aren\u2019t even enough to represent them. Therefore, each lettered model will instead have \u201cBlocks\u201d\u2013 where the manufacturer usually makes some detailed modifications as a response to user experience and demand, usually for implementing different configuration management (CM) systems, and will then subsequently launch the aircraft under the same model name.\nThe first generation of the U.S. military\u2019s F-16, the A/B, included Blocks 5, 10, 15 as secondary model numbers, while the second generation, the F-16C/D, continued the numbering directly from Block 25. When Taiwan first purchased the F-16 27 years ago, there were quite a few add-ons and equipment on the aircraft that put it on par with the F-16C/D, however, in order to not cause any problems with the opposite side of the strait, the United States deliberately tried to pull the wool over their eyes and referred to the aircrafts as F-16A/B Block 20.\nAs for where the model number V comes from, that is a little more interesting. Although the official name given to the F-16 by the U.S. military was the \u201cFighting Falcon,\u201d when it was launched into service in the late 1970s, it coincided with the popularity of the original \u201c Battlestar Galactica \u201d TV show. Owing to the fact Americans have a natural tendency to give everything nicknames, many U.S. Air Force pilots and crews used the name \u201cViper\u201d from the show to refer to these aircrafts, and as there were so many using it, that became the aircraft\u2019s honorary name. Credit: Editors at Illustrated Guide for Weapons and Tactics Due to so many US Air Force officers calling the F-16 fighter jet the Viper, it became prevalent even in public publications. That\u2019s where the V in F-16V comes from.\nThe V comes from the original nickname Viper, but the model name F-16V was actually only used for the \u201cR&D model\u201d when the upgraded aircraft was first announced by Lockheed Martin at the 2012 Singapore Air Show, and has no official record in the USAF, but if we wanted to know where it sits against the rest of the model variants, then it should be something like Block 70/72.\nAs the USAF has F-22 fleets, and now, the technologically more advanced F-35, it is impossible for the USAF to go back to the F-16 series, so there will be no new model numbers released. That means the current informal model number the F-16V is likely to become the general nickname for the aircraft (which, in a country such as Taiwan where we don\u2019t pay much attention to model numbers, that has pretty much already happened).\nThe reason why Lockheed Martin (\u201cLoma\u201d [\u6d1b\u99ac] for short in Chinese) continues to produce the F-16 aircraft is because the price tag of the F-35 is far too high and production is incredibly slow. In addition, the 25 countries that still have operational F-16\u2019s probably don\u2019t all intend to replace their fleets with F-35\u2019s, but they do still have the need to improve the performance of the aircrafts they still have in service. Therefore, the F-16 Combat Avionics Programmed Extension Suite (CAPES) was also introduced, with some upgrades introduced being new technology that is found on the F-35. Credit: Editors at Illustrated Guide for Weapons and Tactics Taiwan\u2019s first official F-16V fighter jet emblem.\nAlthough Taiwan has landed itself in the situation where it will have to wait an eternity for either of the F-35 or F-16C/D, it has suddenly found a compromise that could help solve our problems. Therefore, Taiwan struck while the iron was hot instead of hesitating like it had done before. The whole operation was codenamed \u201c Phoenix Rising ,\u201d with the goal of upgrading the 140 strong F-16 fleet (several jets cannot receive upgrades due to various reasons), for a cost of around US$3.8 billion.\nThe main piece of equipment in the F-16V upgrade was the APG-83 , which is a multi-functional active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. It works similar to compound eyes found on insects as it is composed of hundreds of small transmitting and receiving units, so it does not need to rotate like traditional antennas in order to scan an area; that also allows each unit to be assigned different tasks, so when compared to one of its predecessors, the APG-66 (V) 3 radar, its maximum radar range is longer by over 30 percent.\nThe biggest advantage this new radar system will give to the Taiwan Armed Forces is the substantial increase in its ability to detect the ever-increasing amount of the PLA\u2019s stealth fighter jets, blow their cover and then use the HDMS\u2019 (helmet mounted display system) visual targeting to lock the latest AIM-9X sidewinder missile on their tails. This technology is one of the only ways to help prevent Taiwan\u2019s Air Force from becoming inferior to China\u2019s in the short-to-medium-term future.\nIn addition, NT$19.6 billion was added to the fund last year, so that the upgraded aircrafts will all include DRFM (digital radio frequency memory), radar jammer pods; MTC (mission training center); SNIPER Advanced Targeting Pod; BRU-57, a multiple bomb rack unit; NVG (night vision goggles); ARC-210, multi-mode radio; AGM-154C JSOW (joint standoff weapon), a medium range precision guided weapon; AGM-88B HARM (high-speed anti-radiation missile), an air-to-surface missile, as well as eight other technologies.\nThis article first appeared on the Chinese-language Taiwan edition of The News Lens and can be found here .\nTranslator: Zeke Li\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3517455", "http://lmdefense.com/foreign-military-sales/the-fms-timeline/", "https://twitter.com/Nick1Aspinwall", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/APG-83", "https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3551053", "https://www.defensenews.com/training-sim/2018/04/18/china-sends-warning-to-taiwan-with-naval-drills-near-island/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(1978_TV_series)"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "dod", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "taiwan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T11:56:46.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2723759db9decf2b7491331990b6dcd8a312b18e", "url": "https://www.sde.co.ke/article/2001319170/octopizzo-schools-us-rapper-nas-over-third-world-comment", "site_full": "www.sde.co.ke", "site": "sde.co.ke", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Octopizzo schools US rapper Nas over \u2018third world\u2019 comment - Entertainment News", "title_full": "Octopizzo schools US rapper Nas over \u2018third world\u2019 comment - Entertainment News", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "KE", "spam_score": 0.059, "main_image": "https://www.sde.co.ke/sdemedia/sdeimages/tuesday/octopizzo_schools_us5ca310fd0aee6.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5906, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2723759db9decf2b7491331990b6dcd8a312b18e", "url": "https://www.sde.co.ke/article/2001319170/octopizzo-schools-us-rapper-nas-over-third-world-comment", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sde Reporter", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Octopizzo schools US rapper Nas over \u2018third world\u2019 comment - Entertainment News", "text": "Octopizzo and Nas.\nKenyan rapper Octopizzo has called US rapper Nas over comments he made regarding third world countries.\nWhile mourning rapper Nipsey Hussle who was shot multiple times on Sunday at close range, Nas likened the hatred among African Americans to that experienced in third world countries.\n\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to have money.

A senior State Bank official explained that EMIs were non-bank entities to be licensed by the central bank to issue e-money for the purpose of digital payments.\nSBP\u2019s Deputy Governor Jameel Ahmad said the central bank was currently working on a concept of issuing digital currency by year 2025 to promote financial inclusion and reduce inefficiency and corruption. Moreover, the central bank would adopt evolving-realities of time and would be fully digitised and technology equipped by year 2030.\nAsad stresses flawless cybersecurity\nThe minister said the digital system will revolutionise the entire financial system and therefore the SBP and the FIA need to ensure effective cybersecurity so that no one could misuse the system.\nHe said he had been telling the prime minister that digitalisation of the road to economic revolution and hence he was encouraged to see that the central bank had taken a major step in this direction. This he said this would \u201cresolve different core issues, promote transparency and reduce dependence on human resources\u201d because once the system is expanded it would not be possible for the people to remain outside.\nThe minister said Pakistan currently based macroeconomic issues including low national savings and investments and high fiscal deficits but the biggest challenge was that the national economy was the victim of elite capture. \u201cThose having good relations with Q-block turn to be successful businessman and those making innovations and taking risks, do not become so successful,\u201d he said.\nTherefore, the digitisation would be more beneficial for those taking risks and offering innovations and this culture would bring about fundamental transformation to national economy and keep pace with technological and economic developments in the world.\nThe minister said the launch of regulations for EMIs would complement the government efforts in creating an enabling environment to empower stakeholders in trade and commerce. This will help businesses in improving their productivity and contributing towards positioning the nation for global competition.\nHe said the government was determined to transform the country into a knowledge economy by making IT one of the top contributors to the economy and job creation besides producing world-class knowledge workers in sync with international market trends.\n\u201cIt is our government\u2019s policy to encourage the use of e-commerce amongst public through awareness campaigns to promote a culture of e-commerce, which supports electronic business transactions at national, regional and international levels,\u201d he said.\nJameel Ahmad said the SBP was taking a number of initiatives in transforming itself into a modern, digital and fully technology oriented central bank and the launch of EMIs regulations was the first step in that direction.\n\u201cThese landmark regulations are a testament of SBP\u2019s commitment towards openness, adoption of technology and digitisation of our financial system,\u201d Ahmad said, adding the regulations had been finalised with full commitment and support of the stakeholders who provided extensive and valuable feedback by thoroughly reviewing the draft.\nHe recalled that SBP had issued the regulations for branchless banking about a decade ago that enabled the entry of telecommunication companies into the arena of banking and payments. \u201cThe prime objective of branchless banking was to enable the delivery of financial services using telco-based agent network,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOver the past few years, branchless banking providers have evolved well and are now offering financial services to a large segment of our population,\u201d he added.\nSBP\u2019s Director Payment Systems Department Sohail Javaad explained the objectives and scope of regulations, licensing procedure, governance arrangement, capital requirement, funds safeguarding arrangements, customer due diligence use of agents and interoperability. He said the EMIs will offer innovative digital payment solutions and services to the industry.\nHe said the regulations also covered other regulatory requirements including outsourcing activities, AML/CFT, consumer protection, complaint handling mechanism, oversight and regulatory reporting etc.\nPublished in Dawn, April 2nd, 2019", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jameel ahmad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asad umar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "state bank", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "federal investigation agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fia", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamabad", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T12:14:53.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a89faedadf1ad3677910b841b4238f6dd3cdb0d2", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iran-says-us-sanctions-impeding-flood-rescue-operations/articleshow/68686257.cms", "site_full": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/puducherry", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Puducherry News, Latest Puducherry News Headlines &amp; Live Updates - Times of India", "title": "Iran says US sanctions impeding flood rescue operations - Times of India", "title_full": "Iran says US sanctions impeding flood rescue operations - Times of India", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-68686282,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-174686,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a89faedadf1ad3677910b841b4238f6dd3cdb0d2", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iran-says-us-sanctions-impeding-flood-rescue-operations/articleshow/68686257.cms", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "indiatimes.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Iran says US sanctions impeding flood rescue operations - Times of India", "text": "Donald Trump Iran says US sanctions impeding flood rescue operations Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted late on Monday that America's \"maximum pressure'' policy on Iran \"is impeding aid efforts by #IranianRedCrescent to all communities devastated by unprecedented floods.''

Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted late on Monday that America's \"maximum pressure'' policy on Iran \"is impeding aid efforts by #IranianRedCrescent to all communities devastated by unprecedented floods.''

The floods have struck hundreds of villages as well as towns and cities in the western half of the country, where in some places an emergency situation has been declared. Local authorities in the stricken areas have repeatedly asked for more helicopters to reach remote and cutoff locations. Iranian state media said on Tuesday that dozens of military and Iranian Red Crescent helicopters are taking part in the relief operation. Britain and Germany have offered to send help, including boats and safety equipment. Iranian media reports said the floods have cut off some 80 intercity roads, as well as roads to nearly 2,200 villages, and that electricity and communications with many places, including in western Ilam and Lorestan provinces, have been cut. Authorities have issued evacuation warnings and state TV has broadcast footage showing inundated towns and villages in western and southwestern Iran . State media said officials have warned about the possibility of dams breaking and have ordered emergency water discharges from reservoirs to prevent a catastrophe. Triggered by heavy rainfall, several rivers have burst from their banks. Emergency services are advising people to postpone unnecessary intra-city commutes as well as trips to western and southern Iran , including the oil-rich Khuzestan province which is expecting heavy flooding in the coming days as overflowing rivers from provinces upstream reach Khuzestan. The floods have hit Iran particularly hard, coming against the backdrop of a spiraling economic crisis. President Donald Trump 's decision last year to withdraw from the Iranian nuclear deal with world powers and restore crippling economic sanctions have caused the Iranian currency, the rial, to plummet in recent months, sending prices skyrocketing and wiping out many people's life savings. The floods first began in the second half of March in the northern provinces of Golestan and Mazandaran and later spread. Iran has seen a decades-long drought but the latest flooding has also been blamed on widespread disregard of safety measures and construction of buildings and roads near the rivers. Last year, at least 30 people were killed by flash floods in East Azerbaijan province.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://t.co/vN4viadj8S", "https://twitter.com/JZarif/status/1112792501872672770"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "javad zarif", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammad javad zarif", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "icj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unsc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tehran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T12:21:18.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e24c8eda811a299f4b8d4898e544d32adc6fb642", "url": "https://www.fxstreet.com/news/gbp-usd-recovery-fizzles-again-near-13070-cabinet-meeting-eyed-201904020918", "site_full": "www.fxstreet.com", "site": "fxstreet.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "", "title": "GBP/USD: Recovery fizzles again near 1.3070, Cabinet meeting eyed", "title_full": "GBP/USD: Recovery fizzles again near 1.3070, Cabinet meeting eyed", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://editorial.azureedge.net/images/Markets/Currencies/Majors/GBPUSD/money-pound-sterling-gm172795697-5997711_Large.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9758, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e24c8eda811a299f4b8d4898e544d32adc6fb642", "url": "https://www.fxstreet.com/news/gbp-usd-recovery-fizzles-again-near-13070-cabinet-meeting-eyed-201904020918", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "GBP/USD: Recovery fizzles again near 1.3070, Cabinet meeting eyed", "text": "Sellers continue to lurk amid Hard Brexit fears and below estimates UK construction PMI data.

The U.S. dollar rose to a three-week high.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia has left interest rates unchanged and avoided the outright dovish tone of some other central banks, but traders still treated its policy statement as bad for the currency.\nThe RBA&apos;s stress on the \"downside risks for the global growth environment\" probably caused the currency to weaken, said Commerzbank (DE: CBKG ) analyst Esther Reichelt.\nShe said the government&apos;s budget due on Tuesday should provide some supportive measures. Combined with optimism over China, she said, that should help the Aussie to rebound.\nAustralia&apos;s dollar dropped 0.6 percent to $0.7072 AUD=D3 .\nThe euro, which has also been weakened by a dovish central bank, fell 0.2 percent to $1.1196 EUR=EBS in London on Tuesday -- its weakest since March 8 -- as the U.S. dollar gained.\nThe dollar index , which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of rival currencies, rose 0.3 percent to 97.430 .DXY , a three-week high.\nSterling dropped half a percent after lawmakers rejected four Brexit proposals, heightening Britain&apos;s uncertainty just 10 days before it is due to leave the European Union. The pound was down at $1.3044 GBP=D3 and at 85.84 pence against the euro EURGBP=D3 .\nThe safe-haven Swiss franc held below 1.12 per euro and near 2019 highs.

South Korean won KRW=KFTC declined 0.29 percent versus the dollar, as inflation for March slowed to its weakest pace since July 2016.
