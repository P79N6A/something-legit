Supreme Court has ruled.\nRussell Bucklew was convicted of murder, kidnap and rape in 1996.\nThe 50-year-old argued that death by lethal injection would cause him undue agony by rupturing blood-filled tumours on his face, head, neck and throat caused by a congenital condition called cavernous hemangioma.\nHis lawyers said the death penalty was in violation of the US Constitution's Eighth Amendment, which bars cruel and unusual punishment.\nHowever, judges ruled 5-4 against Bucklew's appeal and said he had failed to present enough evidence for them to grant his request to be executed by lethal gas instead.\nAdvertisement They said Bucklew failed to show that lethal gas could be \"readily implemented\" as required under Supreme Court precedent, adding there was no evidence that his chosen alternative would be less painful.\nJustice Neil Gorsuch wrote: \"The Eighth Amendment does not guarantee a prisoner a painless death - something that, of course, isn't guaranteed to many people, including most victims of capital crimes.\"\nThe judge, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in 2017, also noted that Bucklew was awaiting execution for crimes he committed more than two decades ago.\n\"Yet since then, he has managed to secure delay through lawsuit after lawsuit,\" he added.\nA spokesman for Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt said: \"The state of Missouri and the victims of Russell Bucklew's crimes have waited 23 long years for this just and lawful sentence to be carried out.\n\"We are one step closer to justice.\" he added.\nBucklew was convicted of murdering Michael Sanders, who was living with his ex-girlfriend Stephanie Ray at the time, at his trailer home and shooting at his six-year-old son.\nHe was also convicted of kidnapping and raping his former girlfriend and wounding a police officer before he was arrested, according to court papers.\nSupreme Court judges' diverging opinions over the death penalty have come to light in recent cases.\nIn February, the court allowed the execution of Muslim death row inmate Dominique Ray in Alabama to go ahead after his request for an imam to be present was rejected.\nIn a turnaround, the court last week blocked the execution of Patrick Murphy in Texas because his Buddhist spiritual adviser was not allowed into the death chamber with him.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

efforts and \"economic terrorism\" on Monday as authorities ordered the immediate evacuation of flood-stricken cities in western Iran.\nUS sanctions are \"impeding aid efforts by #IranianRedcrescent to all communities devastated by unprecedented floods,\" Zarif tweeted, referring to search and rescue operations being conducted after huge rainfalls triggered vast flooding.\n\"Blocked equipment includes relief choppers,\" the tweet read, adding that \"this isn't just economic warfare; it's economic TERRORISM.\"\nThe evacuation was ordered after rivers burst their banks, dams overflowed and vast areas were cut off from communication.\nA chronic shortage of rescue helicopters in Iran, due to US sanctions, has forced the emergency services to request help from military helicopters and amphibious armoured personnel carriers to assist in the rescue operations.\nThe authorities declared a \"situation red\", the highest level of alert, in Lorestan province with four or five cities \"completely critical\", state television news network IRINN reported from Khorramabad, the region's capital.\n\"In Khorramabad the water has risen by as much as three metres (nearly 10 feet) in parts... and reports are coming in of regions... completely submerged with residents stranded on their rooftops,\" it added.\nThe Red Crescent's provincial director, Sarem Rezaee, said his organisation had lost contact with much of the region.\n\"Telephones are not working, our radio communications are down... at this moment we have no news of other cities and villages,\" he told IRINN, adding roads were flooded and helicopters were unable to take off due to the bad weather.\n\"We have requested emergency help from neighbouring provinces but at the present no one can do anything.\"\nThe airport in the western city of Khorramabad was flooded, with images showing water submerging the runway and cutting the province's main air link to the rest of the country.\nAuthorities in Lorestan ordered evacuations in many regions, bringing in the armed forces to forcibly remove those who do not comply, local media reported.\n'Lost all contact' The authorities said Pol-e-Dokhtar and Mamulan cities were already half submerged, with one fatality reported in Mamulan.\nImages on local media show water gushing through streets in Pol-e-Dokhtar where the water level had reached 1.5 metres (five feet).\nEvery village in the vicinity of the two cities had been surrounded by flood waters while all five dams in Lorestan had reached capacity and four of them were overflowing.\n\"We have lost all contact with Pol-e-Dokhtar,\" the Lorestan Governor General Mousa Khademi told the semi-official ISNA News Agency.\n\"We do not have any information on the situation there... we do not know how many people have been affected by the floods,\" he added.\nNumerous rivers had burst their banks and landslides blocked many roads, said the reports.\nMedia outlets showed images of collapsed bridges and oil and gas pipelines destroyed by the flood.\nThe main railway line linking Tehran to the south of the country had also been blocked by the flood.\nThis is the third major flood to hit Iran in the past two weeks with unprecedented rainfalls in the mostly arid country that had endured a decades-long drought until this year.\nThe first occurred in the northeast of the country on March 19 and the second struck the west and southwest of Iran on March 25 with a combined toll of 45 people killed.\nThe present flood has again struck in the west and southwest following heavy rain that is set to continue into Tuesday.\nApart from Lorestan half a dozen other provinces are also facing critical circumstances, with the emergency services reporting 23 out of Iran's 31 provinces have been affected and could face floods.\nWith the consecutive floods the reservoirs of many dams have reached full capacity forcing emergency discharge, as much as 1,800 cubic metres per second in some cases, to prevent them from breaking.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "javad

The agency said while prior Kia and Hyundai vehicle recalls covered by the probe are primarily related to engine fires, the new probe \"is not limited to engine components and may cover additional vehicle systems or components.\"\nJason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said it was \"long past time for the full power of the federal government to be brought to bear to answer why so many thousands of Kia and Hyundai vehicles have been involved in non-crash fires.\"\n He added he hoped the probe will quickly lead to new recalls. \"The evidence is now clear - Hyundai and Kia should have acted to recall these vehicles far earlier,\" he said.\nLast month, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said a group of U.S. states is investigating Hyundai and Kia for potential unfair and deceptive acts related to reports of hundreds of vehicle fires.\nIn November, Reuters reported federal prosecutors had launched a criminal investigation into Hyundai and Kia to determine if vehicle recalls linked to engine defects had been conducted properly.\nSouth Korean prosecutors are also conducting separate investigations into the automakers over the recalls, raiding their offices and summoning executives for questioning.\nIn January, the automakers agreed to offer software upgrades for 3.7 million vehicles not being recalled.\nA South Korean whistleblower in 2016 reported concerns to NHTSA, which has been probing the timeliness of three U.S. recalls and whether they covered enough vehicles.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson in WASHINGTON; Additional reporting by Hyunjoo in SEOUL; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Christopher Cushing)\nSource: Reuters", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://sentifi.com", "https://cdn-pub.sentifi.com/custo/widgets.js"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "kia", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hyundai", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "center for auto safety", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyundai motor co", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhtsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kia soul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kia motors corp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kia optima", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyundai motor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national highway traffic safety administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyundai sonata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kia motors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa fe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T12:44:05.074+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3bd48fbeaaab77c5441ee0949e5ebf4b3dbe66f9", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/health/doctors-need-to-do-better-talking-to-families-of-critically-ill-11402700", "site_full": "www.channelnewsasia.com", "site": "channelnewsasia.com", "site_section": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/health", "site_categories": ["society", "tech"], "section_title": "Latest health news and headlines - CNA", "title": "Doctors need to do better at talking to families about critically ill patients: US study", "title_full": "Doctors need to do better at talking to families about critically ill patients: US study - CNA", "published": "2019-04-02T01:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/10480744/16x9/991/557/beb0c46302b9f41b331de05c36c7173f/CZ/file-photo--a-doctor-holds-her-stethoscope-in-an-outpatients-ward-at-a-hospital-in-london-5.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6036, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3bd48fbeaaab77c5441ee0949e5ebf4b3dbe66f9", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/health/doctors-need-to-do-better-talking-to-families-of-critically-ill-11402700", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "channelnewsasia.com", "published": "2019-04-02T01:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Doctors need to do better at talking to families about critically ill patients: US study", "text": "Doctors' conversations with families about care for critically ill patients often fail to address patients' values and preferences, according to a US study that suggests there's plenty of room for improvements in communication.\nThese conversations are an essential component of so-called shared decision making, which depends on clinicians taking the time to explain the benefits and harms of treatment options and also listening to patients and families explain what they hope to gain from any interventions. When it's done right, shared decision making improves patient satisfaction and helps ensure that care plans are designed to achieve outcomes most important to patients and families.\nAdvertisement For the current study, researchers assessed what transpired in 244 conferences between clinicians and families of patients in acute respiratory distress and at least a 50 per cent chance of dying in the hospital.\nPatients were 58 years old on average and hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs). They were unable to advocate for themselves; families had to decide what treatment to provide, and when to focus on comfort care rather than aggressive interventions.\nOnly 68 per cent of these conferences included discussions of patients\u2019 values and preferences for end of life care, researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine. And these conferences specifically applied patients' values to treatment decisions just 44 per cent of the time.\nDone right, good communication \"can provide people time to say good-bye, to participate in religious or spiritual rituals, to complete items on a 'bucket list,' and sometimes even to die at home,\" said lead study author Dr. Leslie Scheunemann of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre.\nAdvertisement Advertisement \"It can improve symptom management, reduce suffering, and provide emotional support to families,\" Scheunemann said by email. \"Conversely, worse communication can contribute to patients receiving potentially burdensome treatments they would not have wanted, distract people from saying good-bye, and increase how stressful and burdensome decision-making is for families.\"\nIn only 36 per cent of the conferences did clinicians and families discuss important considerations for end-of-life care like how much patients would want to retain cognitive, physical or social functioning or the role of spirituality in their lives.\nClinicians made treatment recommendations based on patients' preferences in just eight percent of the conferences.\nThe study wasn't a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how these conferences might improve shared decision making or how giving patients and families more say in their care might impact quality or patient satisfaction.\n\"Physicians tend to focus on making a decision about the processes of care (should we intubate? should we resuscitate?) whereas patients and families think about the outcomes of that care,\" said Dr Terri Fried of the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, and the VA Connecticut Healthcare System, in an email.\n\"If this is not fully discussed at the time a treatment decision needs to be made in the ICU, then patients won't receive the care that is either most likely to achieve the outcomes they want or avoid the outcomes they don't want,\" said Fried, who wrote an editorial about the study.\nPatients and families may need to speak up and ask very direct questions to ensure they get the care that feels like the best choice for their specific circumstances and values, Fried advised.\n\"Patients (if they are able) and families (if they are making decisions on behalf of a patient) need to ask doctors to be clear on what all the reasonable choices are in any situation, and what is most likely to happen if they pursue one choice or another,\" Fried said. \"One strategy that is gaining in popularity is to ask physicians about the best case and worst case that could result from each choice.\"\nSource: Reuters", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T12:45:10.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "33484237fee19231250ecf6ac20f38249c407ae5", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/outpouring-of-grief-for-hyderabad-dentist-killed-in-us-accident/articleshow/68682985.cms", "site_full": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Hyderabad News: Latest Hyderabad News, Telangana news Headlines &amp; Live Updates - Times of India", "title": "Outpouring of grief for Hyderabad dentist killed in US accident | Hyderabad News", "title_full": "Outpouring of grief for Hyderabad dentist killed in US accident | Hyderabad News - Times of India", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.999, "main_image": "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "33484237fee19231250ecf6ac20f38249c407ae5", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/outpouring-of-grief-for-hyderabad-dentist-killed-in-us-accident/articleshow/68682985.cms", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Uttara Varma", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Outpouring of grief for Hyderabad dentist killed in US accident | Hyderabad News", "text": "HYDERABAD: Days after the accidental death of Hyderabad dentist Arshad Mohammed in Chicago late on Thursday night, there has been an outpouring of grief from staff, students and faculty at University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), where the 32-year-old was pursuing his orthodontics residency.\nCondolences also poured in from faculty members of orthodontics programmes across the US following the fatal car crash.Reacting to Mohammed\u2019s death, the department head of orthodontics at University of Illinois at Chicago, Dr Veerasathpurush Allareddy, said, \u201cWithin a very short time, Arshad made a positive impression on everyone and was a role model.

This was revealed in the first CNBC/Survey Monkey Workplace Happiness Index, announced at the @Work Talent + HR Summit on Tuesday.\nThe quarterly index measures how Americans feel about their jobs across five key categories \u2014 pay, opportunities for advancement, recognition, autonomy and meaning. CNBC and SurveyMonkey poll 8,664 professionals nationwide across a wide swath of industries March 13\u201318. Data has been weighted for age, race, sex, education, employment status and geography using Census Bureau's Current Population Survey to reflect the demographic composition of United States employed population.\nThe CNBC/SurveyMonkey Workplace Happiness Index is an optimistic 71 out of 100, while the survey found 85 percent of respondents are either somewhat or very satisfied with their jobs.\n\"Meaningfulness\" was the biggest contributor to overall happiness, with 17 out of 20 possible points contributed to the overall index score of 71. Recognition, or how much colleagues value employee contributions, added 15 points, and autonomy, or work/life balance, added another 15. Opportunities for advancement was the biggest \"drag\" on the overall index.\nDespite the overall optimism, only 9 percent of workers gave top ratings across all five categories of the Workplace Happiness Index. Twenty-seven percent of workers surveyed say they are not well paid, and 30 percent have seriously considered quitting their job in the last three months.\n\"Our study clearly reveals that workplace happiness is richly nuanced. While a big majority of U.S. workers are at least somewhat satisfied with their jobs, there are a lot of negatives when it comes to how people relate to their work,\" said Jon Cohen, SurveyMonkey's chief research officer.\nThe survey found that providing workers with opportunities to advance their careers may be the best way to keep them from leaving. Just 13 percent of workers who say their companies provide \"excellent\" opportunities for advancement were thinking of quitting their jobs. But there are no guarantees, and the survey did not reveal a single solution to keeping employees happy.\n\"If companies want to hire and retain great employees, they need to open up feedback loops to get at the 'why' \u2014learning what makes people happy and productive,\" Cohen said.\nSurvey Methodology: This SurveyMonkey online poll was conducted March 13-18, 2019, among a national sample of 8,664 workers in the United States. Respondents for this survey were selected from the more than 2 million people who take surveys on the SurveyMonkey platform each day. The modeled error estimate for this survey is plus or minus 1.5 percentage points. Data have been weighted initially for age, race, sex, education, and geography using the Census Bureau's American Community Survey to reflect the demographic composition of the United States age 18 and over, then weighted for age, race, sex, education, employment status, and geography using Census Bureau's Current Population Survey to reflect the demographic composition of United States employed population.

F ive-year-old Roxana Gozzer hasn\u2019t seen her father for weeks and does not know the next time she will. Walter Gozzer-Sing never returned home from a \u201croutine\u201d check-in with immigration officials in February. After a month in detention, he was placed without notice on a flight from Miami to Peru. His sudden deportation left the family \u2013 including two US citizen children \u2013 without their only source of income.\nUnder the bridge: migrants held in El Paso tell of dust, cold and hunger Read more\nRoxana has become a face of a titanic battle in Florida over a \u201cracist\u201d bill that has united activists, Democrats and some police chiefs in opposition. If state bill 168 passes, they say, many more families will face separation.\nUnder the proposed law, sponsored by a hardline Republican who was Donald Trump\u2019s state chair in 2016, local authorities and law enforcement agencies would effectively become federal immigration agents with a responsibility to report and detain undocumented migrants.\nThe intention, according to state senator Joe Gruters, is simply to enhance public safety by speeding up the removal of violent or \u201cbad criminals\u201d and outlawing so-called sanctuary cities that do not comply with existing immigration laws.\nOpponents insist that far from targeting only criminals and those who Trump considers to be \u201cbad hombres\u201d, families like Roxana\u2019s, with undocumented but working parents, would be at increased risk of deportation. They say a simple traffic stop could lead to an arrest and detention that law enforcement would be compelled to report to Immigration and Customs Enforcement before keeping that person in custody for up to 48 additional hours, to await collection by federal agents if Ice issued a detainer request.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why they get angry with families like ours that just want to have a better life,\u201d said Lily Montalvan, who has looked after Roxana and her son Ronnie, 16, alone since her husband, a construction worker, was deported.\n\u201cI had a beautiful family, always together. For my husband, his life was his work and us. This has destroyed us and I do not know how we are going to continue.\u201d\n\u2018It is horrible\u2019 Montalvan and Roxana met Gruters in Tallahassee last week as part of a hundreds-strong delegation from groups including the Florida Immigrant Coalition (Flic) and United We Dream . She said she told him her husband was not a criminal but a hard worker with valid US government labour certification whose only goal since arriving from Peru in 1988 was to raise and support his family. She said Gruters, also the chair of the Republican party of Florida, was unmoved.\n\u201cI asked my daughter how she felt leaving the senator\u2019s office and she said, \u2018It is horrible,\u2019\u201d Montalvan said.\nI don\u2019t understand why they get angry with families like ours that just want to have a better life\nLily Montalvan Also among the delegation was 19-year-old Nataly Chalco, a student of political science and economics at Florida State University who grew up in south Florida after her family moved from Peru when she was six.\n\u201cPoliticians claim that this bill is strictly to take criminals of the streets, but it doesn\u2019t make anyone feel better when you realise the definition of criminals includes people who are undocumented,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThings like a broken taillight or driving to work can lead to the separation of families. Undocumented means that every time a loved one gets behind the wheel you get scared. We deserve to live in communities where we aren\u2019t treated like criminals simply for existing.\u201d\nChalco, whose status remains uncertain while the future of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( Daca ) is decided, said fear of being stopped prevented her parents helping her move to college.\n\u201cI had to do it alone,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was too big a risk for my mom and dad to drive eight hours. One more stop and it could become a felony that could lead to deportation.\u201d\nTomas Kennedy, political director of Flic, said the bill passing Florida\u2019s Republican-dominated legislature, possibly in the next two weeks, would leave almost 900,000 undocumented migrants wary of interacting with law enforcement.\n\u201cPeople are afraid, people have anxiety, kids are frightened their parents are going to be sent away,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe bill is apocalyptic, with racist language. It deputises police officers to cooperate with Ice [and] apart from the humanitarian and physical perspective, we end up paying for that bill. Domestic violence victims are already scared to go to the police: imagine the climate of fear of these proposals would foment. The trust between public and law enforcement would just be shattered. People would be very afraid to cooperate with law enforcement.\u201d\nI don\u2019t care if you have papers or don\u2019t have papers, where you came from or who your parents are. That\u2019s not my job\nJorge Colina, City of Miami chief of police Jorge Colina, chief of the City of Miami police department, is also concerned.\n\u201cI\u2019d prefer not to have this job if I had to ask fellow officers to go check where someone is from before helping them,\u201d he said in a Spanish-language interview on Actualidad Radio . \u201cI don\u2019t care if you have papers or don\u2019t have papers, where you came from or who your parents are. That\u2019s not my job. My job is to make sure everyone in this city is safe.\u201d\nOpponents claim the law would harm Florida\u2019s economy. A study by New American Economy calculated a loss of $3.5bn in gross domestic product and a drop in tax receipts of more than $100m if just 10% of the state\u2019s undocumented workers were to leave, the same percentage that fled Arizona\u2019s workforce following the passage of the since-repealed \u201cshow me your papers\u201d law of 2010.\n\u201cThe economy in Florida is powered by immigrants,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThese people work in construction, in tourism, in the hospitality industry. They\u2019re taking care of people\u2019s kids, they\u2019re cleaning homes, they\u2019re serving in restaurants.\n\u201cWhen Georgia passed a similar law in 2011 workers fled to neighbouring states and crops were literally rotting because nobody was picking them. We\u2019re sure we\u2019ll see a similar effect in Florida, it\u2019s a huge agricultural state, a citrus-growing state among other things, and it would be an economic catastrophe.\u201d\n\u2018We\u2019re trying to enforce the law\u2019 Democratic opposition to the bill centres on its \u201csanctuary cities\u201d provision, which would prevent resisting cooperation with federal immigration authorities, specifically over detainer requests. They argue no such law is needed because there are no sanctuary cities in Florida.\nThe small Texas town where Trump's wall will destroy families and livelihoods Read more\n\u201cThere are no jurisdictions in Florida that are out of compliance with information sharing laws at the federal government level,\u201d said Jose Javier Rodriguez, state senator for Miami. \u201cWhy does this bill create the phantom of sanctuary cities? Frankly it\u2019s to keep the issue of immigration alive. It is for political purposes.\u201d\nIn a phone interview, Gruters accused detractors of \u201cfearmongering and misinformation\u201d.\n\u201cThe only people who will be impacted by this are criminal illegals who are going to jail,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has nothing to do with anybody else. If you are an illegal alien here in Florida and you\u2019re trying to be a contributing member of society, your kids are going to school, and you\u2019re not breaking the law, you have nothing to worry about.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to change immigration law, all we\u2019re trying to do is define it by saying that local governments cannot prohibit cooperation with existing laws. It\u2019s common sense.\n\u201cHere in Florida we\u2019re going to try to enforce the law and get rid of some of these bad criminal illegal aliens.\u201d\nTopics US immigration Florida Human rights features", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://research.newamericaneconomy.org/report/economic-cost-of-florida-senate-bill-168-and-house-bill-527/", "https://unitedwedream.org/", "https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/06/georgias-harsh-immigration-law-costs-millions-in-unharvested-crops/240774/", "https://www.ice.gov/daca", "https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/16/494245921/deal-is-reached-on-arizonas-hardline-immigration-law-after-6-year-fight", "https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2019/00168", "https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/locations/florida/", "https://floridaimmigrant.org/", "http://actualidadradio.com/noticias/directores-de-policias-de-miami-y-miami-dade-armar-a-los-maestros-no-es-la-solucion-video/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roxana gozzer", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "walter gozzer-sing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roxana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe gruters", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el paso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T13:08:45.057+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d1f54077bcfbe50b60e361a41edf5f4c06fe0832", "url": "https://article.wn.com/view/2019/04/02/3_Indians_charged_in_US_with_visa_fraud_again/", "site_full": "article.wn.com", "site": "wn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.wn.com/English/keyword/america", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WN.com -

The American operatives worked for Project Raven, a secret Emirati intelligence programme that spied on dissidents, fighters and political opponents of the UAE monarchy. A Reuters investigation in January revealed Project Raven's existence and inner workings, including the fact that it surveilled a British activist and several unnamed US journalists. The Raven operatives - who included at least nine former employees of the US National Security Agency and the US military - found themselves thrust into the thick of a high-stakes dispute among US's [Persian] Gulf allies. The Americans' role in the UAE-Qatar imbroglio highlights how former US intelligence officials have become key players in the cyber wars of other nations, with little oversight from Washington. The crisis erupted in the spring of 2017, when the UAE and allies - including Saudi Arabia and Egypt - accused Qatar of sowing unrest in the Middle East through its support of media outlets and political groups. The UAE camp demanded Qatar take a series of actions, including shuttering the Qatar-funded Al-Jazeera satellite television network, withdrawing funding from other media outlets Doha supports, and cracking down on the Muslim Brotherhood. In June 2017, the UAE camp severed diplomatic ties with Doha and imposed an air, land and sea blockade against Qatar. It was an unprecedented confrontation among Arab countries that had historically prized consensus. That week, Project Raven operatives sprang into action, launching operations to break into the Apple iPhones of at least 10 journalists and media executives they believed had connections to the Qatari government or the Muslim Brotherhood, according to programme documents reviewed by Reuters and four people involved in the activities. Raven targeted Arab media figures who spanned a range of political thought - from a Beirut-based BBC host to the chairman of Al-Jazeera and a producer from a London satellite channel founded by a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. The goal, the former Raven operatives said, was to find material showing that Qatar's royal family had influenced the coverage of Al-Jazeera and other media outlets, and uncover any ties between the influential TV network and the Muslim Brotherhood. Reuters couldn't determine what data Raven obtained. Al-Jazeera has long maintained it is independent of Qatar's government. Jassim Bin Mansour Al Thani, a media attache for Qatar's embassy in Washington, stated that \"the government of Qatar does not request, ask, or enforce on Al-Jazeera any agenda whatsoever\". Al-Jazeera \"is treated like any other respected media outlet\". The UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment. The NSA declined to comment. A US Department of Defense spokeswoman declined to comment. Dana Shell Smith, the former US ambassador to Qatar, said she found it alarming that US intelligence veterans were able to work for another government in targeting a US ally. She added that Washington should better supervise US government-trained hackers after they leave the intelligence community. \"Folks with these skill sets should not be able to knowingly or unknowingly undermine US interests or contradict US values,\" Smith told Reuters. Among the Arab journalists hacked, Raven project documents show, was Giselle Khoury, Beirut-based host of BBC Arabic's \"The Scene\", a programme that interviews Middle Eastern leaders on current events. Three days after the blockade began, Raven operatives hacked her iPhone. Raven programme documents show she was targeted because of her contact with Azmi Bishara, a Doha-based writer who has been critical of the UAE and founded the news outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed. \"They need to spend their time on making better their country, their economy,\" Khoury said in an interview after Reuters informed her of the hack, adding, \"Not on having Giselle Khoury as a hacking target.\" On June 19, 2017, Americans working for Raven targeted Faisal al-Qassem, host of a popular Al-Jazeera show called \"The Opposite Direction\", interviews and documents show. The show features guests who heatedly debate controversial topics such as corruption in Middle Eastern governments. Informed by Reuters about his hacking, al-Qassem said he was not surprised he was targeted by the UAE, which he accuses of being \"a symbol of corruption and dirty politics\". \"In a word, they are afraid of the truth,\" he added. That same day, Raven operatives targeted the iPhone of Al-Jazeera's chairman, Hamad bin Thamer bin Mohammed Al Thani. Through an Al-Jazeera spokesman, Al Thani declined to comment. The attacks utilised a cyberweapon called Karma. As Reuters reported in January, Karma allowed Raven operatives to remotely hack into iPhones by inputting a target's phone number or associated email address into the attack software. Unlike many exploits, Karma did not require a target to click on a link sent to an iPhone, they said. Apple declined to comment. Karma provided Raven operatives access to the contacts, messages, photos and other data stored on iPhones. It did not allow them to monitor phone calls. While Raven operatives broke into the devices, they did not have full access to the data they collected; they passed the material on to UAE intelligence officials overseeing the operation. It's unclear what they found. In January, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash was asked by reporters in New York about Project Raven after the initial Reuters report. Gargash acknowledged his country has a \"cyber capability\" but did not specifically address the programme. He denied targeting US citizens or countries with which the UAE has good relations. The UAE created Project Raven in 2009 with the help of American intelligence contractors and former senior White House officials from the George W Bush administration. The US National Security Council declined to comment on Project Raven. At first, the goal was to crack down on terrorism by helping the UAE monitor fighters around the region. But Raven's mission quickly expanded to include monitoring and suppressing a range of UAE political opponents, the documents show. Among its targets was Qatar, which the UAE and Saudi Arabia had long accused of supporting political opposition across the region, in part through the Qatari government's funding of Al-Jazeera. During the Arab Spring protests of 2011, [Persian] Gulf countries viewed Al-Jazeera's expansive coverage of street demonstrations as a deliberate attempt by Qatar to drive opposition to their monarchs. \"It was seen as a tool to foment popular unrest,\" stated Elisa Catalano Ewers, a former adviser on the region for President Barack Obama's National Security Council. Al-Jazeera's protest coverage \"had a huge psychological impact\" for demonstrators, said Moncef Marzouki, the former president of Tunisia, who was elected in 2011 after Arab Spring demonstrations overthrew long-time ruler Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. The broadcasts sent a message to protesters that \"this battle is happening everywhere, you are not alone\". Al-Qassem, the host hacked by Raven, said Al-Jazeera presents all sides, without censorship, adding, \"The street and the Arab people can decide what's right.\" Wary of the Muslim Brotherhood's growing influence in the region after the 2011 protests, UAE authorities launched a crackdown on dozens of individuals who have been convicted of planning to overthrow the government. In 2014, the UAE formally designated the Muslim Brotherhood and local affiliates as terrorist groups. The Emiratis also tapped Raven in the effort to contain dissent at home, according to former Raven operatives and project documents. In the years after the Arab Spring, the operatives were increasingly tasked with targeting human rights activists and journalists who questioned the government. In June 2017, after [Persian] Gulf nations began their blockade of Qatar, the UAE ramped up efforts to spy on journalists seen as tied to Qatar. That month, Project Raven's Qatar mission expanded from two full-time operatives assigned to the country to seven. On June 20, Raven operatives hacked into the iPhone of Abdullah Al-Athba, chief editor of Qatar's oldest newspaper, Al-Arab, programme documents show. In an interview with Reuters, Al-Athba stated that he believed he was targeted \"because I am a supporter of the Arab Spring since the beginning\", who repeatedly criticised the Emiratis for their opposition to the movement. The Raven effort went beyond the Middle East. Operatives used Karma to target the mobile phones of other media figures the UAE believed were being supported by Qatar, including journalists for London-based Arabic media outlets Al-Araby TV and Al-Hiwar. Both networks televise Arabic language channels popular in the Middle East. Al-Thani, the Qatari spokesman, said the government does not support Al-Araby TV, Al-Hiwar or Al Arab. The satellite channel Al-Araby TV and its namesake website are units of London-based Fadaat Media Ltd, owned and supported by Qatari businessmen. The outlet sees itself as the voice of \"secular, liberal, pro-democracy\" Arabs, stated Abdulrahman Elshayyal, director of Al-Araby TV. He and two other Araby employees were hacked in the weeks following the start of the blockade, Raven documents show. \"It's a very worrying trend that a state is using all these things to spy on people critical of them,\" Elshayyal said in a phone interview, adding, \"I'm not a terrorist or a money launderer.\" Bishara, the founder of Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, was also targeted by Raven. He told Reuters he regards his outlet as \"relatively independent\" in the context of the Arab world. \"Nobody tells us what to say,\" said Bishara, a Palestinian Christian who lives in Qatar, though \"sometimes the newspaper might be sensitive about what not to say, because you are not there to provoke the people that finance you.\" Al-Hiwar, another London-based Arabic satellite channel, was targeted by Raven on the day the blockade began. Al-Hiwar founder Azzam Tamimi said he believes the UAE was fearful of his channel's support for political reform and democratisation in the Arab world. Unlike others caught in the crosshairs of Project Raven, though, Al-Hiwar doesn't deny being sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood, which the outlet supports \"because they are the victims\", he added. Tamimi told Reuters he is a longtime Muslim Brotherhood member and a supporter of Hamas. Tamimi declined to say whether the channel received money from the Qatari government but stressed that he'll accept any support, provided there's no strings attached, noting that the channel gives voice to a range of opinions and encourages dialogue, but there are limitations. \"The majority of our viewers are Muslim,\" he said in a phone interview, adding, \"We are not going to market ideas that are alien to our culture. That's what makes us popular.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "al-jazeera", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us national security agency", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tehran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qatar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united arab emirates", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T13:23:16.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a789f0c0f9f9bc90a8428406d90158354bf057f9", "url": "https://article.wn.com/view/2019/04/02/US_experts_Too_soon_to_pull_breast_implants_tied_to_cancer/", "site_full": "article.wn.com", "site": "wn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.wn.com/English/keyword/health", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WN.com - Health News", "title": "US experts: Too soon to pull breast implants tied to cancer", "title_full": "US experts: Too soon to pull breast implants tied to cancer - Worldnews.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tQf4bTBa3Oc/0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5594, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a789f0c0f9f9bc90a8428406d90158354bf057f9", "url": "https://article.wn.com/view/2019/04/02/US_experts_Too_soon_to_pull_breast_implants_tied_to_cancer/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "wn.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "US experts: Too soon to pull breast implants tied to cancer", "text": "SILVER SPRING , Md. \u2014 Government medical advisers said Monday, March 25, it\u2019s too soon to ban a type of breast implant that has recently been linked to a rare form of cancer, saying more information is needed to understand the problem.\nThe Food and Drug Administration panel didn\u2019t recommend any immediate", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "md.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T13:24:24.082+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3919c8906a93ce6250bf33be71eb167919d8eda7", "url": "http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13980113000090", "site_full": "en.farsnews.com", "site": "farsnews.com", "site_section": "http://en.farsnews.com/rss.aspx?srv=20", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Fars News Agency", "title": "3 Major US Airlines Experience System-Wide Computer Outages", "title_full": "3 Major US Airlines Experience System-Wide Computer Outages", "published": "2019-04-02T05:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 794, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3919c8906a93ce6250bf33be71eb167919d8eda7", "url": "http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13980113000090", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T05:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "3 Major US Airlines Experience System-Wide Computer Outages", "text": "Tue Apr 02, 2019 2:26 3 Major US Airlines Experience System-Wide Computer Outages Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- The technical mishap is said to have affected major national carriers United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines, and follows on widespread outages last week causing delays at major airports across the country, according to reports.

Turkey has only received one unit of the fifth-generation fighter thus far, but all current and future shipments of equipment related to the aircraft have been halted, Pentagon said, unless Ankara gives up its commitment to take delivery of a Russian S-400 missile defense system, RT reported. A NATO ally of the US, Turkey was planning on ordering 100 F-35s, and had signed on to produce fuselage and other components for the next-generation aircraft. However, US lawmakers moved to exclude Ankara from the program, fearing Turkey\u2019s planned purchase of the Russian-made S-400 air defense system could give the Russian system opportunity to learn how to track and spot the jet. US President Donald Trump signed a bill last year blocking the transfer of F-35s to Turkey, but the F-35 Joint Program Office announced that it would execute the transfer according to existing plans. Four US Senators introduced another bipartisan bill last week to prohibit the transfer until Ankara agrees to abandon the S-400 deal. At present, the deal remains on the table. \"The contract with Russia on S-400s remains in force and these defensive systems will be delivered to Turkey. Now talks on this issue are underway,\" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu stated on Friday, according to Russian news agency TASS. The first of four S-400 batteries will be delivered to Turkey this July. Washington has thus far failed to woo its NATO ally away from the Russian system and to Raytheon\u2019s more expensive Patriot system. Turkey has been a vital partner in the F-35 program, which itself has been plagued by cost overruns, delays and performance issues while being the US military's most expensive project to date. Turkey has been making parts of fuselage, landing gear and cockpit displays for the jets and has invested some $1.25 billion in the trillion-dollar program. Despite Ankara\u2019s integral role, US officials told Reuters last week that Washington can press ahead without the Turkish components, although doing so will drive the cost of the project up further. The first F-35 jet was delivered to Turkey in a ceremony in Texas in June. Throughout the dispute, Turkish pilots have been training on the F-35 at an airbase in Arizona since last July.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "f-35 joint program office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tehran", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T13:24:37.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "26599e8995875a82bc43c864bc6acf4cb1dc897c", "url": "https://hypestat.com/info/800-us-reward.com", "site_full": "hypestat.com", "site": "hypestat.com", "site_section": "https://hypestat.com/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "HypeStat.com", "title": "800-us-reward.com - 800-us-reward", "title_full": "800-us-reward.com - 800-us-reward", "published": "2019-04-01T23:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7923, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "26599e8995875a82bc43c864bc6acf4cb1dc897c", "url": "https://hypestat.com/info/800-us-reward.com", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-01T23:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "800-us-reward.com - 800-us-reward", "text": "This can take up to 60 seconds.

When asked by an enthusiastic red carper interviewer if he was excited as she was, Smith offered the hilariously deadpan response, \u201c By the sound of it, no .\u201d That said, there is something that he appears to be more thrilled about: He plans on celebrating the 30th anniversary of The Cure\u2019s 1989 album Disintegration by performing it during some US dates.\n30th anniversary shows have already been announced for Australia, and when asked in a new Rolling Stone interview if the band would be taking the tour to the US, Smith said:\n\u201cIt\u2019s inevitable, I think. When we did the last festival, I said, \u2018This is it.\u2019 But once we\u2019ve rehearsed it, I know it\u2019s going to be really good. We\u2019re holding home theaters in New York and Los Angeles. But I kind of feel like we should do it in a bigger venue. I\u2019d like to a big show with it, really. It\u2019s a bigger album. I think when we did the first three albums we did three nights at the Beacon in New York. It was much more punky. We were trying to recreate that vibe. But I think Disintegration is just big. So we need to do somewhere that\u2019s just big. But probably about Christmas time we\u2019ll come back.\u201d\nHe also talked about his band\u2019s \u201cf*cking great\u201d upcoming album, saying of it, \u201cIt\u2019s so dark. It\u2019s incredibly intense. And I\u2019ve waited ten years to do something that means something. It\u2019s going to work really well. I\u2019m not sure how much of it we\u2019ll play this summer at festivals. It\u2019s not really festival music. The songs are like 10 minutes, 12 minutes long. We recorded 19 songs. So I have no idea what to do now. The others are saying, \u2018Triple album!\u2019 I\u2019m saying, no let\u2019s not. I\u2019ll pick six or maybe eight songs and do like a single album. But I think it will delight our hardcore fans. And probably really, really infuriate everyone else. At my age, I\u2019m still doom and gloom.\u201d\nRead the full interview here , and check out the band\u2019s (officially announced) upcoming dates below.

Not only did the PlayStation Store seemingly imply that Naughty Dog's third-person action adventure would be arriving sometime this year, but a developer diary from the studio earlier last month turns out it's been hiding some new revelations about the game in question.\nAs spotted by the Last of Us' eagle-eyed fanbase on Reddit , Naughty Dog's International Women's Day video from March 8 features glimpses of various employees working on the sequel, and the blink-and-you'll-miss-it images seen on their desktops gives us our best look at the game since E3 2018.\nAt 0:50, for example, you can spot what appears to be Joel moving around as the playable character on the screen in the background, but it's the 0:38 mark which proves the most provident in unofficially revealing more about The Last of Us 2 before its next big PR push. Have a look for yourself before we get into it.\nNow, pause, zoom, and enhance . The screenshot behind Naughty Dog UI designer Mar\u00eda Capel's face is almost definitely one a workbench, The Last of Us' stationary recuperation hubs where you could upgrade and modify your arsenal of weapons. You can even see the word \"Upgrade\" on the top left of the screen, and the highlight is over a revolver pistol.\nWhile this isn't exactly a bombshell of a revelation for those familiar with The Last of Us' gameplay, the fact that workbenches are seemingly returning with a much better looking user interface will be a small comfort to core fans. This is, of course, all a work in progress, and The Last of Us 2's finished Workbench UI could look completely different to what we're seeing here, or may be eventually scrapped altogether.\nThere's also a chance that we're looking at a screenshot from The Last of Us 2's yet to be announced multiplayer mode, though the mug in the background again suggests we're looking at an in-game workbench. Yes, maybe I am overthinking it, but until Naughty Dog decides to reveal more about its follow up to a last-gen masterpiece, it's all we've got.\nThe Last of Us 2 is already one of our most anticipated new games of 2019 .

At 6 pm, the local unit was traded at 4.0790/0820 against the greenback from 4.0800/0850 at last Friday\u2019s closing. A dealer said the ringgit also rebounded from last week\u2019s lower performance, as the greenback retreated from recent gains on profit-taking. He said the US Federal Reserve\u2019s indication that there would be no interest rate increase for this year but only a single hike in 2020, gave positive news to emerging market currencies including the ringgit. \u201cMeanwhile, the higher crude oil prices, with benchmark Brent crude futures currently at US$68.63 per barrel, had supported the ringgit, as Malaysia, being a net exporter of oil and gas, is heavily dependent on the price movements of the commodity,\u201d he said. The ringgit traded mostly lower against a basket of major currencies. It declined against the Singapore dollar to 3.0114/0141 from Friday\u2019s close of 3.0086/0128, depreciated against the British pound to 5.3419/3474 from 5.3122/3203 and fell against the euro to 4.5832/5882 from 4.5737/5809.

According to the lawsuit filed last week, the incident occurred on April 1, 2018.\nThe victim claimed that Uber \"breached its duties\" to her as a customer by failing to \"warn her of the risk its services posed to women, and in particular to women who had been consuming alcohol or who were intoxicated\", The Verge reported on Monday.\nThe woman is seeking $10 million in damages from both the driver Vasquez and Uber to compensate for the physical and emotional injuries she sustained from the assault.\nAccording to media reports, over a period of four years, at least 103 Uber drivers have been accused of sexually assaulting or abusing their passengers in the US alone. A total of 31 Uber drivers have been known to have been convicted for crimes, the report said.\nIn June 2017, the company fired over 20 employees after an investigation into the workplace culture and sexual harassment claims. The same year, the company was sued by a woman who was raped by an Uber driver in India, following which former Uber CEO and Co-founder Travis Kalanick stepped down from his post.\nIn October 2018, Cameron Poetzscher who headed corporate development at Uber was asked to step down amid allegations of sexually harassing female colleagues.\n0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.ecoti.in/zNXYba", "http://www.ecoti.in/fFNWSY21", "http://www.ecoti.in/aOGJOZ34", "http://www.ecoti.in/WB401b"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vasquez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raul rodriguez vasquez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T14:07:44.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f0f62b54657afa384253f0a814037e1f673eb6ab", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/news/scottish-jam-spreads-across-the-pond-to-the-us--2", "site_full": "www.gov.uk", "site": "www.gov.uk", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tax_planning", "politics", "law_government_and_politics", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Scottish jam spreads across the pond to the US - GOV.UK", "title_full": "Scottish jam spreads across the pond to the US - GOV.UK", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.035, "main_image": "https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/85941/s960_MJ_39_1__copy.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 669, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f0f62b54657afa384253f0a814037e1f673eb6ab", "url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/news/scottish-jam-spreads-across-the-pond-to-the-us--2", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Scottish jam spreads across the pond to the US - GOV.UK", "text": "Scottish jam spreads across the pond to the US Today, thousands of people across America will celebrate National Peanut Butter and Jelly day. Published 2 April 2019 Department for International Trade\nToday (2 April 2019), thousands of people across the US will celebrate National Peanut Butter and Jelly Day with a dollop of jam, thanks to the rise in exports from the UK\u2019s biggest seller of jams, marmalades and preserves in the USA, Mackays.\nFounded in 1938, Mackays is a family run business producing a unique range of Scottish jams, marmalades and curds for a quality homemade taste. The company\u2019s preserve is made by hand in traditional copper pans, remaining true to Dundee\u2019s history of jam-making.\nThe US is Mackays\u2019 biggest export market, where its jams are stocked in all 50 states and territories - accounting for 20% of international sales last year. With support from the Department for International Trade (DIT), Mackays\u2019 preserves are now enjoyed in 94 countries worldwide including Australia, China, Guatemala, Guyana, Korea and Peru. Ross Allen, Director of DIT North America, said: My kids love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and I am delighted that more Americans are discovering the culinary peaks that can be reached by using top notch Scottish jam. Mackays is an excellent example of a thriving transatlantic business and I look forward to following the growth of UK food and drink in the United States.\nWith 165 employees based in its Arbroath jam factory, Mackays fills 25 million jars a year. The company has established a globally recognised brand, with exports now accounting for 32% of its annual turnover of \u00a318 million.\nIn 2018, the UK exported 50,000 tonnes of jam to 119 markets worldwide, resulting in jam exports rising by 9% to \u00a3145 million. Martin Grant, Managing Director of Mackays, said: Export is a crucial part of our business and a key driver for Mackays continued high growth; an increase of 25% in the last two years alone. The popularity of our products in the States is testament to the global appeal of great taste, provenance and authenticity - all vital ingredients that go into each and every jar of Mackays. Seeing our products embraced and interpreted by different cultures is one of the unspoken joys of export. In our home town of Arbroath, the jam piece - Scots for sandwich! - still suffices which makes seeing our Nordic customers adding lemon curd to baked fish or our friends in American combining jam with peanut butter such a treat.

The US Census Bureau is scheduled to release the monthly report at 12:30 GMT and consensus estimates predict a 1.8% m/m fall during the reported month, down from a downwardly revised 0.3% rise in the previous month. Excluding transportation items - core durable goods orders, which tend to have a broader impact than the volatile headline figures are anticipated to rise 0.2% in February as against January's adjusted 0.2% fall.\nAs Joseph Trevisani, FXStreet's own Senior Analyst explained: \u201cThe relative weakness in the February retail sales figures, missing forecasts by 0.5% in the overall number, and 0.6% in the control group might argue for lowering expectations in its sub-category of durable goods. But the large upward revision in the January sales numbers and the potential for positive adjustments to February\u2019s results bring the balance to neutral. On the other hand, better performance in the February durable statistics is a strong hint that the retail numbers are understated.\u201d\nDeviation impact on EUR/USD\nReaders can find FX Street's proprietary deviation impact map of the event below. As observed, the reaction is likely to be in the range of 20-25 pips during the first 15-minutes in case of a deviation from +0.36 to -0.51 and could extend up to 51-55 pips in the following 4-hours.\nEUR/USD important levels to watch\nYohay Elam, FXStreet's own Analyst offers some important technical levels ahead of the important release: \u201cThe Technical Confluences Indicator shows that the 21-month low of 1.1176 is also the confluence of the Pivot Point one-week Support 1, the PP one-day S2, and the Bollinger Band one-day Lower. On the downside, the only noteworthy support area below 1.1176 is 1.1115 which is the PP one-month S1.\u201d\n\u201cResistance is also close and it is a bit softer. At 1.1221 we see a dense cluster of levels including the Fibonacci 23.6% one-day, the previous yearly low, the Simple Moving Average 100-15m, the SMA 10-4h, the BB 15min-Upper, the SMA 5-4h, the previous 4h-high, and the BB 1h-Middle. Further above, significant resistance awaits at 1.1285 which is the convergence of the Fibonacci 161.8% one-day, the Fibonacci 38.2% one-month, the SMA 200-1h, the Fibonacci 61.8% one-week, the PP 1d-R3, and the BB 1d-Middle,\u201d he added further.\nKey Notes", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "haresh menghani", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "joseph trevisani", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "us census bureau", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T14:11:23.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1e0ece03246bd3030639ac408cc09777c238bbdd", "url": "https://www.indiatimes.com/entertainment/celebs/ranbir-kapoor-asking-a-photographer-yeh-chappal-kahan-se-li-proves-he-s-like-all-of-us-364726.html", "site_full": "www.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Ranbir Kapoor:Ranbir Kapoor Asking A Photographer 'Yeh Chappal Kahan Se Li' Proves He's Like All Of Us! - Indiatimes.com", "title_full": "Ranbir Kapoor:Ranbir Kapoor Asking A Photographer 'Yeh Chappal Kahan Se Li' Proves He's Like All Of Us! - Indiatimes.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Apr/ranbir_kapoor_1554193158_800x420.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1e0ece03246bd3030639ac408cc09777c238bbdd", "url": "https://www.indiatimes.com/entertainment/celebs/ranbir-kapoor-asking-a-photographer-yeh-chappal-kahan-se-li-proves-he-s-like-all-of-us-364726.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ranbir Kapoor:Ranbir Kapoor Asking A Photographer 'Yeh Chappal Kahan Se Li' Proves He's Like All Of Us! - Indiatimes.com", "text": "> Ranbir Kapoor Asking A Photographer 'Yeh Chappal Kahan Se Li' Proves He's Like All Of Us!

Global markets were flying thanks to stronger than expected manufacturing data out of China. Asian markets are still in the green this morning, but off their earlier highs. On the local front, our market was flying too. The only companies under strain were the dual-listed stocks. A strong Rand hurting their local share prices.\nNot good news for us though was the news from the tax man, Sars misses revenue collection target for fifth year in a row . If SARS collects less than expected, our budget deficit is higher than expected which pushes up our debt to GDP ratio. The need for economic growth cannot be emphasised enough. As the pressure on consumers increases, tax compliance decreases. Economic growth will empower the consumer again, increase tax collections, decrease debt to GDP ratio, improve Eskom's prospects and improve South Africa's debt rating. As you can see, growth solves a whole host of South Africa's problems.\nYesterday the JSE All-share closed up 1.15%, the S&P 500 closed up 1.16%, and the Nasdaq closed up 1.29%.\nOne thing, from Paul\nThe world of investment is always exciting, and always evolving. High rates of company revenue growth always attract investors . The recent IPO of the world's second-best ride hailing company Lyft was well received, and even though the company has never made a profit, it's market capitalisation is now above $20 billion.\nIf that sounds scary, consider unlisted property leasing company WeWork . Actually, they prefer to call themselves a \"community co-working space operator\". WeWork doubled its revenue, net loss and membership between 2017 and 2018. The group now has a presence in 425 facilities in 100 cities in 27 countries, including Johannesburg. Its major financial backer is SoftBank, which is an investment holding entity comparable to Naspers (JO: NPNJn ).\nWeWork has grown its annual revenue by over 100% for each of the past eight years . Sounds amazing, must be a strong buy, right!? However, its revenue in 2018 was only $1.82 billion and its net loss for the year was $1.9 billion. So, losses exceed revenue ? Hmm.\nI worry that office space is really just office space. WeWork is really just renting space, adding edgy features and selling shared work areas to other companies. True, they are branching out into residential units and related services, but how wide can they go? Is this really a transformational business, or is it the kind of thing that can only work when the economy is booming and smaller businesses are expanding? Time will tell.\nwework\nByron's Beats\nHere is another good news South African business story.

Here is a link talking about the assumptions and limitations of the rule - The 4% rule isn't an endpoint, it is a starting point.\nMy personal retirement plan is to try to amass a large enough capital base, which will allow me to live off of dividend distributions and not need to ever sell any capital. I'm not sure that I will ever truly stop working though, so a small side income will help subsidise the dividend income. All this is only 30 - 40 years away, so time will tell how this turns out.\nRetirement savings\nBright's Banter\nWhen we think of the most profitable companies in the world we tend to lean towards technology or biopharmaceutical companies with super high margins right. New data from Moody's revealed that state-backed oil giant Saudi Aramco netted a breathtaking $111.1 billion in net income last year.\nThat's the same as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) ($59.5 billion), Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) ($30.74 billion), and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) ($22.17 billion) combined! Aramco basically runs circles around other oil companies like Royal Dutch Shell (LON: RDSa ) ($23.9 billion) and US giant Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM ) ($20.8 billion). This is the first disclosure from the Saudi national oil producer as their financials have been under wraps for over 75 years.\nWhy would Aramco want their financial affairs to be public knowledge? Well, the company was testing if the bond market had any appetite for their paper and they managed to raise $10 billion in funny money in the process. This is part of their grand plan to eventually list parts of the company on the markets.\nThe biggest risks to Saudi Aramco's fortunes is the fact that all their earnings stem from just one country (big geographical risk) and everything is dependent on the performance of the oil price. Did I mention that Aramco lives and dies by the whim of the Saudi government? I wonder though who still wants to invest in an oil company in 2019 because it ain't gonna be me!\nSigning off\nThe JSE All-share is higher this morning and the Rand continues to strengthen.

The reason? It was all for his kids, apparently.\nAccording to Channel NewsAsia , Kwok Woei Jie was unemployed at the time of the theft, which took place at two different outlets over three days this January. The toys he nicked included a Nerf toy gun, Monopoly Cash Grab sets, a Porsche 911 Lego set that cost S$279.99, and a S$529.99 Gundam Astray Red Frame Kai.\nKwok\u2019s first theft occurred on Jan 9 this year at Waterway Point in Punggol, followed by another try on Jan 21, when he was nabbed by the store manager, who kept tabs on his movements in the shop. After taking back the three items Kwok stole, the manager recognized him from previous visits and discovered on closed-circuit television footage Kwok\u2019s prior attempt a couple weeks ago.\nHowever, that wasn\u2019t enough to deter the man. A mere four days later, he hit up the toy store at City Square Mall and shoplifted four toys worth a total of S$100, stuffing them in his pockets while he paid for two drinks. Unfortunately for Kwok, the store manager thought he looked familiar and stopped him from leaving once she uncovered news of his arrest at Punggol.\nKwok was unrepresented in court yesterday, and maintained that he had swiped the toys for his two children, who are in Primary 1 and Primary 3. He explained he did not have a job when he stole from Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, though he now works as a midnight deliveryman. Admitting to his crime, he insisted that he was not scheming to sell the toys for money.\nKwok will return to court for mitigation and sentencing on Friday. He pleaded guilty yesterday to three charges of theft, with a fourth charge taken into consideration, and can be jailed up to seven years and fined for each count of theft in dwelling.\nIn the online sphere, netizens sympathized with the father\u2019s desperate act, though acknowledging his motives did not condone the crime. Meanwhile, others questioned his intentions in buying such expensive toys that seemed to be more for adults than kids.\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 6 NEXT SLIDE > \u00a9 Provided by Coconuts Media Limited But at the end of the day, a crime is still a crime.\n\u00a9 Provided by Coconuts Media Limited Truer words were never said.\nThis article, People have mixed feelings about the father who stole over $1k worth of items from Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us for his kids , originally appeared on Coconuts , Asia's leading alternative media company.

The U.S. dollar rose to a three-week high.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia has left interest rates unchanged and avoided the outright dovish tone of some other central banks, but traders still treated its policy statement as bad for the currency.\nThe RBA&apos;s stress on the \"downside risks for the global growth environment\" probably caused the currency to weaken, said Commerzbank (DE: CBKG ) analyst Esther Reichelt.\nShe said the government&apos;s budget due on Tuesday should provide some supportive measures. Combined with optimism over China, she said, that should help the Aussie to rebound.\nAustralia&apos;s dollar dropped 0.6 percent to $0.7072 AUD=D3 .\nThe euro, which has also been weakened by a dovish central bank, fell 0.2 percent to $1.1196 EUR=EBS in London on Tuesday -- its weakest since March 8 -- as the U.S. dollar gained.\nThe dollar index , which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of rival currencies, rose 0.3 percent to 97.430 .DXY , a three-week high.\nSterling dropped half a percent after lawmakers rejected four Brexit proposals, heightening Britain&apos;s uncertainty just 10 days before it is due to leave the European Union. The pound was down at $1.3044 GBP=D3 and at 85.84 pence against the euro EURGBP=D3 .\nThe safe-haven Swiss franc held below 1.12 per euro and near 2019 highs. It traded 0.1 percent higher at 1.1186 EURCHF=EBS , below 2019 highs of 1.117.\nRBC Capital Markets strategist Adam Cole said he did not expect the franc to hold its gains because the Swiss National Bank remained \"sensitive\" to a stronger currency, particularly when it traded below 1.12 francs versus the euro.\nThe SNB will be \"the last central bank in the developed world to tighten rates,\" he said.\nCryptocurrencies surged. Bitcoin jumped 20 percent to touch $5,000, its highest since November BTC=BTSP .

Market Snapshot Global stocks traded mixed Tuesday, with markets in Asia touching a seven month high as Wall Street futures sputtered, as investors balanced stronger-than-expected factory data from the world's biggest economies against increasing evidence that their ongoing trade war has damaged growth in other parts of the world.\nPrivate readings of manufacturing activity in both the U.S. and China yesterday showed modest improvements for both of the world's factory powerhouses in March, with China rising into growth mode for the first time in four months and the U.S. bouncing from two-year lows. The upbeat assessments, however, clouded the fact that readings from other major economies, such as Germany and Japan, slumped to multi-year lows as countries without a seat at the negotiation table continue to suffer the affects of the U.S.-China trade war.\nThe contrast has lead to a mixed open for global assets prices Tuesday,with Japan's Nikkei 225 sliding modestly into the red by the close of trading as the broader MSCI Asia ex-Japan index added 0.19% to touch a seven-month high on hopes of both broader China stimulus and a near-term trade agreement with the United States.\nU.S. equity futures, however, were more muted in early trading, with contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average suggesting a 10 point pullback from yesterday's solid 329 point gain, its best performance in more than two weeks, and those linked to the S&P 500 indicating a 1.5 point slip for the broader benchmark.\nInvestors will get another chance to gauge the health of the industrial economy today with durable goods orders for the month of February at 8:30 am eastern time, as well as a look at same store retail sales through the Johnson Redbook twenty five minutes later.\nWalgreens Boots Alliance ( WBA - Get Report ) posted weaker-than-expected second quarter earnings and slashed its 2019 outlook, warning profits would be \"roughly flat\" from the previous year, sending shares 6.3% lower to $59.48 each in pre-market trading.\nBitcoin prices spiked higher Tuesday, briefly topping the $5,000 mark for the first time in nearly five months, in a move that has left market watchers bewildered by the mysterious surge.\nBitcoin jumped more than 20% in the span of a few minutes during Asia trading hours on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, taking prices for the world's best-know cryptocurrency nearly $950 higher from its opening price to trade at $5,080.00 each, the highest since November 19.\nEuropean stocks were little changed at the start of trading in Frankfurt, with the Stoxx 600 edging 0.28% into the green to extend the benchmark's year-to-date advance closer to 14% as the euro drifted below 1.12 against the U.S. dollar following yesterday's surprisingly soft inflation data for the currency area.\nBritain's FTSE 100 was marked around 0.9% higher in the opening minutes of trading in London, helped in part by basic resource stocks and a weaker pound, which slipped to 1.3036 against the greenback after lawmakers failed for a second time to find a majority for any of the various Brexit alternatives under debate.\nLast night's vote essentially means Parliament has rejected a no Deal Brexit, Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit, a second Brexit referendum and a softer Brexit built around common ties with the European Union.\nGlobal oil prices extended gains in overnight trading, taking both U.S. and international crude to fresh 2019 highs, as traders piled on more bullish bets in the wake the stronger-than-expected U.S. and China factory data as well as a Reuters report that suggested the U.S. would remove waivers issued to eight global economies next month that allow them to buy sanctioned Iranian crude exports.\nBrent crude contracts for June delivery, the global benchmark for oil prices, were marked 9 cents higher from their Monday close in New York and changing hands at $69.10 per barrel in early European dealing while WTI contracts for May delivery were seen 37 cents higher at $61.96 per barrel.\nU.S. gasoline prices were Quote: d at a national average of $2.67 per gallon on the Gasbuddy.com comparison website Tuesday, the highest since early November and a 20.2% increase since the start of the year.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mario draghi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "china factory data", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ecb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "thestreet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frankfurt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T14:35:06.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "62152925912b7d8bcd9dcc7150c29eb82b2bd1df", "url": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=12218732", "site_full": "www.nzherald.co.nz", "site": "nzherald.co.nz", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/co/CIqI", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "New Zealand Herald -

And now diehard vegans can pick up the creation blowing everyone's minds at Burger King. Impossible Foods, famous for the Impossible Burger, has created an Impossible Whopper for select Burger King restaurants in the US, adding further fuss over the world's most talked about burger.

The Impossible Whopper is only available at the St. Louis outlet for a limited time and one fan went to get it as soon as he heard the news. \"I bought a second for a diehard meat eater that straight said he would not have known that it was plant-based,\" he said. \"I kept looking at mine trying to make sure it WAS plant-based. This is amazing seeing plant-based options in fast food.\" The Impossible Whopper has mayonnaise, which can be omitted by request, and is cooked on a surface shared with conventional meat. If successful, it may be rolled out across the chain's more than 7000 locations in the US later this year. Pat Brown, chief executive of Impossible Foods, confirmed the news, saying people should think of it as \"a 'meta' April Fool's Joke\".

More money, of course! But perhaps surprisingly, a majority say that a higher salary is not the one change that would most improve their job satisfaction.

Fourteen percent said they would like \"more training or learning opportunities,\" while 9 percent said more paid time off would most improve their job satisfaction. Less than half (41 percent) said \"higher salary\" when polled.\nshow chapters Pay and work opportunities rank as big factors in workplace happiness, new survey finds 11:52 AM ET Tue, 2 April 2019 | 01:32 The quarterly index was created as part of CNBC's @Work franchise, which includes a three-part event series spotlighting the future of work. The index measures how Americans feel about their jobs across five key categories \u2013 pay, opportunities for advancement, recognition, autonomy and meaning. CNBC and SurveyMonkey poll 8,664 professionals nationwide across a wide swath of industries. Data has been weighted for age, race, sex, education, employment status, and geography using Census Bureau's Current Population Survey to reflect the demographic composition of United States employed population.\nThe first measure of the CNBC/SurveyMonkey Workplace Happiness Index is an optimistic 71 out of 100.\nWhen it comes to salary, 25 percent of workers say they are in fact \"very well paid,\" and 48 percent say they are \"somewhat well paid.\"\nThe survey found that, even beyond paying them more, providing workers with opportunities to advance their careers may be the best way to improve employee satisfaction. In fact, dissatisfied workers are more likely to say they lack opportunities to advance than they are to say they are not well paid. \"Four in 10 workers give their companies a negative rating on how well they help their employees advance their careers,\" said Jon Cohen, SurveyMonkey Chief Research Officer. \"That's the highest negative rating of the five index composites, and an obvious area for improvement.\"\nIt's little surprise then, that across all ages, demographics and worker types, opportunities for training and learning was the second most popular choice for what could most improve job satisfaction (after pay), finishing ahead of seemingly popular benefits like more paid time off, more flexible schedule or increased family benefits.\nThe CNBC/SurveyMonkey online poll was conducted March 13\u201318 among a national sample of 8,664 workers in the United States. Respondents for this survey were selected from the more than 2 million people who take surveys on the SurveyMonkey platform each day. Data have been weighted initially for age, race, sex, education and geography using the Census Bureau's American Community Survey to reflect the demographic composition of the United States age 18 and over, then weighted for age, race, sex, education, employment status and geography using Census Bureau's Current Population Survey to reflect the demographic composition of U.S. employed population. The modeled error estimate for this survey is plus or minus 1.5 percentage points.

Bilibili Inc., a popular Chinese online entertainment platform, proposed on Monday to offer convertible bonds of up to 300 million U.S. dollars in total and with a tenor of 7 years, in a bid to raise more capital.\nThe move came as the latest of a U.S.-listed Chinese company resorting to convertible bonds to seek investment in capital markets, following China's leading online entertainment company iQIYI's issuance of convertible bonds of 1.05 billion U.S. dollars and due 2025 on March 27.\nThe bonds will be convertible into American deposit shares (ADSs) and will mature on April 1, 2026, unless repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date, according to a company statement.\nAn ADS is a U.S. dollar-denominated equity share of a foreign-based company for purchase on a U.S. stock exchange.\nThe interest rate, initial conversion rate and other terms of the bonds will be determined at the time of pricing of the bonds.\nBilibili said it intended to grant the initial purchasers in the bonds a 30-day option to buy additional such bonds worth 45 million dollars.\nUpon conversion, the company will deliver the ADSs or pay cash to replace any fractional ADS to such converting holders.\nHolders of the bonds may also require the company to repurchase all or part of their bonds in cash on April 1, 2024, or in the event of certain fundamental changes.\nThe online video giant noted it planned to use the net proceeds from the bonds to enrich content offerings, invest in research and development, and for other general corporate purposes.\nFirst launched in June 2009 and officially named \"Bilibili\" in January 2010, Bilibili has become one of China's largest anime streaming platforms, featuring videos, live broadcasting and mobile games.\nThe online platform went public on the Nasdaq in March 2018.

The aircraft is built by Lockheed Martin Corp.\nA Pentagon official had told Reuters in March that the United States had a number of items it could withhold in order to send Turkey a signal that the United States was serious about Ankara dropping its ambition to own the S-400.\nTurkish officials in Ankara were not immediately available for comment. Turkey has said it will take delivery of the S-400s in July.\nNATO SUMMIT\nThe U.S. decision on the F-35s was expected to complicate Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu's visit to Washington this week for a NATO summit. On Sunday, Erdogan suffered one of his biggest electoral losses in decades in local elections.\n\"Certain Russian weapon systems are seen as inherently threatening to the United States regardless of who is operating them and for what purpose,\" Andrew Hunter, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said.\n\"Because Turkey is not just an F-35 purchaser, but an industrial partner, blocking delivery of these systems represents a major escalation by the United States as it threatens to impose serious costs on both sides,\" Hunter said.\nReuters reported last week that Washington was exploring whether it could remove Turkey from production of the F-35. Turkey makes parts of the fuselage, landing gear and cockpit displays. Sources familiar with the F-35's intricate worldwide production process and U.S. thinking on the issue last week said Turkey's role can be replaced.\nThe United States and other NATO allies that own F-35s fear the radar on the Russian S-400 missile system will learn how to spot and track the jet, making it less able to evade Russian weapons.\nIn an attempt to persuade Turkey to drop its plans to buy the S-400, the United States offered the pricier American-made Patriot anti-missile system in a discounted deal that expired at the end of March. Turkey has shown interest in the Patriot system, but not at the expense of abandoning the S-400.\nTurkey has engaged with U.S. negotiators in recent days about buying the Patriot system, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The system is made by Raytheon Co.\nTurkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar in March said that despite some issues, Turkish pilots were continuing their training at an air base in Arizona on the F-35, each of which costs $90 million, and that Ankara was expecting the aircraft to arrive in Turkey in November.\nBy halting jet deliveries, the Pentagon could subsequently delay training of Turkish pilots. Two additional jets are scheduled to arrive in Arizona in April and a significant delay could impact Turkey's November target date for operations.\nU.S. lawmakers also have expressed alarm over Turkey's planned purchase of the Russian system. Four U.S. senators last week introduced a bipartisan bill that would prohibit the transfer of F-35s to Turkey until the U.S. government certifies that Ankara will not take delivery of the S-400 system.\nFollowing news of the halt, U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, one of the bill sponsors, said she was glad to hear the administration was \"to delay the transfer of F-35 equipment to Turkey to help ensure U.S. military technology and capabilities cannot fall into the hands of the Kremlin.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://adserver.adtech.de/adserv/3.0/1425/6622549/0/170/ADTECH;loc=300", "http://adserver.adtech.de/adlink/3.0/1425/6622549/0/170/ADTECH;loc=300", "http://adserver.adtech.de/addyn/3.0/1425/6622549/0/170/ADTECH;loc=100;target=_blank;grp="], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mike andrews", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defense department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T15:43:45.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6a7f7cfad01c67a2b2c6fe76c594e036b3a8e77e", "url": "http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/8/329290/World/Region/USbacked-fighters-clash-with-IS-militants-in-easte.aspx", "site_full": "english.ahram.org.eg", "site": "ahram.org.eg", "site_section": "http://english.ahram.org.eg/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Ahram Online - News, Business, Culture, Sports &amp; Multimedia from Egypt ", "title": "US-backed fighters clash with IS militants in eastern Syria - Region - World", "title_full": "US-backed fighters clash with IS militants in eastern Syria - Region - World - Ahram Online", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "EG", "spam_score": 0.982, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3598, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6a7f7cfad01c67a2b2c6fe76c594e036b3a8e77e", "url": "http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/8/329290/World/Region/USbacked-fighters-clash-with-IS-militants-in-easte.aspx", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "AP", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "US-backed fighters clash with IS militants in eastern Syria - Region - World", "text": "U.S.-backed Syrian fighters are battling the Islamic State group in eastern Syria 10 days after declaring victory over the extremists, an official with the Kurdish-led force said Tuesday.\nMustafa Bali, a spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces, said they are rooting out groups of militants who were hiding in caves in and near the village of Baghouz.

By Online Desk WASHINGTON: Three Indian-origin consultants in the US have been charged with substantive visa fraud for submitting sham applications for the popular H-1B visas to gain a competitive advantage over competing firms.\nA federal grand jury last month indicted Kishore Dattapuram (49) of Santa Clara, Kumar Aswapathi (49) of Austin, Texas, and Santosh Giri (42) of San Jose, on ten counts of substantive visa fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud, the Department of Justice said in a statement.\nAccording to the eight-page indictment, the trio operated Nanosemantics, Inc, a Santa Clara-based consulting firm whose services included placing skilled foreign workers at software and technology companies in the Bay Area in California.\nDattapuram, Aswapathi and Giri worked together to submit fraudulent H-1B visa applications on behalf of foreign workers in order to gain a competitive advantage over competing firms. The defendants used Nanosemantics to submit fraudulent I-129 petitions and obtain H-1B visas for workers that the defendants could later place at local companies.\nBy maintaining a group of available workers, the defendants would gain a competitive advantage over consultants that properly applied for paperwork only after matching a qualified worker to and available job.\nThe defendants, who were arrested last week in their respective towns of residence, entered pleas of not guilty and were released on bonds. They are next scheduled to appear on May 13 for a status conference before Judge Edward J Davila, US District Judge.\nIf convicted, the defendants face a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution if appropriate for each violation.\nThe H-1B visa programme, popular among Indian technology professionals, allows foreign workers to obtain temporary authorisation to live and work for employers in the US.\nTo secure an H-1B visa, an employer or other sponsors must submit an 'I-129' petition to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.\nA petition and associated documentation must confirm the existence and duration of the job waiting for the worker, and describe key details including the wages associated with the position.\nAccording to the indictment, several of the I-129 petitions submitted by defendants stated that particular workers had specific jobs waiting for them at designated companies when, in reality, the defendants knew that these jobs did not exist. Further, the defendants allegedly sought the cooperation of third parties to conceal their fraud.

President Donald Trump\u2019s threats to close the southern border with Mexico, joking that the shutdown would hamper spring breakers.\n\u201cShow us your slats,\u201d Colbert said, punning on the fencing material that could be used to build the president\u2019s proposed border wall and suggesting students who were planning to vacation in Cancun this year could spend spring break at the wall.\nThe Late Show host began the segment with an April Fool's joke. \u201cSpeaking of national security...Trump is still concerned with our southern border. In response to a surge of migrants coming to this country today Trump unveiled a new approach that treats asylum seekers fairly and humanely. April Fool's\u2014I gotcha,\u201d Colbert quipped.\n\u201cIn fact, Trump threatened to shut the Mexico border just in time for spring break. Hey college kids, I know you had your heart set on Cancun but how about \u2018Spring Break: Wall?\u2019\u201d Colbert asked, speaking in front of a graphic showing college students cavorting in swimwear in front of a wall.\nLate-night comedy host Stephen Colbert arrives at the PaleyFest presentation of \"An evening With Stephen Colbert\" at the Dolby theater on March 16, in Hollywood, California. VALERIE MACON/AFP/Getty Images Colbert continued to mock the president\u2019s tweet from last Monday that threatened to close the border with Mexico. \u201cMexico has for many years made a fortune off of the U.S., far greater than Border Costs. If Mexico doesn\u2019t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING\u2026the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week,\u201d Trump wrote in what Colbert called \u201can epic, three-part policy tweet.\u201d\nAccording to The Associated Press, Trump said Friday that his border closure threat could mean the end of all trade with Mexico. \u201cWe will close it for a long time,\u201d he added.\nWhile the president has highlighted the money lost to policing the southern border and fighting the drug war, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned a full border closure would amount to \u201can unmitigated economic debacle,\u201d threatening 5 million jobs in the United States.\nThe U.S. and Mexico trade about $1.7 billion in goods daily. The burden of a border closure would fall on cross-border communities along the frontier, from San Diego to southern Texas.\nFor more than two years, both on the campaign trail and in the Oval Office, Trump has promised to build a wall along the length of the frontier. With a new migrant caravan heading north from El Salvador and Guatemala, the president has suggested closing the border for the short-term and visiting the frontier on Friday.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stephen col", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "stephen colbert", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "colbert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cancun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T16:10:19.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "03534413467d4b4485c5980a6bfbaa748e6e68c3", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/burger-king-launches-plant-based-impossible-whopper-11682142", "site_full": "news.sky.com", "site": "sky.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Burger King launches plant-based 'Impossible Whopper' | US News | Sky News", "title_full": "Burger King launches plant-based 'Impossible Whopper' | US News | Sky News", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.061, "main_image": "https://e3.365dm.com/19/04/1600x900/skynews-whopper-burger-king_4626873.jpg?20190402122657", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 849, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 819, "comments": 646, "shares": 207}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "03534413467d4b4485c5980a6bfbaa748e6e68c3", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/burger-king-launches-plant-based-impossible-whopper-11682142", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Burger King launches plant-based 'Impossible Whopper' | US News | Sky News", "text": "Fast food chain Burger King says it will trial a new plant-based alternative to its meat burgers.\nThe Impossible Whopper is made with a type of soybean root called heme, which gives the impression of bleeding, getting close to simulating real meat.\nIn a promotional video, the chain tried the fake meat burger on customers who claimed to know the difference between meat and alternatives.\nThe video showed them being fooled by the alternative when it was substituted for their regular Whopper order.\nImage: The plant-based patties have fooled some people The patty is made by Impossible Foods and is the same already sold at competing chain White Castle.\nAdvertisement Burger King has made the patty available at several locations in the St Louis area in Missouri, but the New York Times reports the chain may roll it out across all 7,200 US restaurants if the trial is successful.\nBurger King's North America president Christopher Finazzo told Reuters: \"We wanted to make sure we had something that lived up to the expectations of the Whopper.\nMore from US Teen who 'escaped kidnappers' claims he is boy who went missing in 2011 Serial killer sketches 10 more unidentified victims as FBI appeals for information Thousands sign online petition to save 'Flintstone' house at centre of planning row Helen Mirren tells crowd: 'I love Netflix, but f*** Netflix!' at CinemaCon in Las Vegas Joe Biden: Ex-US vice president says he will be 'more mindful' of women's personal space Donald Trump claims wind turbine noise causes cancer \"We've done sort of a blind taste test with our franchisees, with people in the office, with my partners on the executive team, and virtually nobody can tell the difference.\"\nAlthough the patty is vegan, the chain will sell it with mayonnaise, meaning the sandwich will be vegetarian as a whole.\nThe Impossible Foods patty will cost about $1 (77p) more than the regular meat version.\nPat Brown, chief executive of Impossible Foods, said: \"We're now in well over 6,000 restaurants.

They are next scheduled to appear on May 13 for a status conference before Judge Edward J Davila, US District Judge.\nIf convicted, the defendants face a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of USD 250,000, plus restitution if appropriate for each violation. 0 Comments ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.ecoti.in/ihMkHb", "http://www.ecoti.in/qrwkaY37", "http://www.ecoti.in/QXVN8b", "http://www.ecoti.in/6DaUNa"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kishore dattapuram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kumar aswapathi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aswapathi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santosh giri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nanosema", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dattapuram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giri", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "economic times", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "united states citizenship and immigration services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa clara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san jose", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T16:42:21.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6821bd5ab3ca9207ffdf2ddecaf3bf6648e5194f", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aud-usd-forex-technical-analysis-034311888.html", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "AUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 April 2, 2019 Forecast", "title_full": "AUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 April 2, 2019 Forecast", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.015, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vavXAxmEVJSM5mjn6XEaGQ--~B/aD00MjA7dz02MzA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/fx_empire_176/9a6d6cddbe0ca9692cc2fb0f61bfa038", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6821bd5ab3ca9207ffdf2ddecaf3bf6648e5194f", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aud-usd-forex-technical-analysis-034311888.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "James Hyerczyk", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "AUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 April 2, 2019 Forecast", "text": "AUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis \u2013 April 2, 2019 Forecast James Hyerczyk Reblog The Australian Dollar is trading lower shortly before the release of the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) interest rate decision and monetary policy announcement. The RBA is widely expected to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged. However, traders seem to be betting on a dovish tone in the policy statement. Some investors believe the central bank will remain neutral, counting on the strong labor market to pull it through the current economic slowdown. At 03:21 GMT, the AUD/USD is trading .7109, down 0.0005 or -0.06%. Daily AUD/USD More Daily Technical Analysis The main trend is up according to the daily swing chart. However, momentum is trending lower. A trade through .7168 will signal a resumption of the uptrend. A move through .7041 will change the main trend to down. The minor trend is down. This is driving the momentum. A trade through .7133 will change the minor trend to up and shift momentum to the upside. A move through .7064 will reaffirm the downtrend. The AUD/USD is also caught inside a pair of retracement zones that have been causing a choppy, two-sided trade for nearly three months. The major retracement zone at .7079 to .7153 is controlling the longer-term direction of the AUD/USD. The short-term range is being controlled by the retracement zone at .7105 to .7129. Daily Technical Forecast Based on the early price action, the direction of the AUD/USD on Tuesday is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the 50% level at .7105. Bullish Scenario A sustained move over .7105 will indicate the presence of buyers. If this creates enough upside momentum then look for a rally into a resistance cluster at .7128 to .7129. Taking out .7129 will lead to a test of .7133. This could trigger an extension of the rally into a downtrending Gann angle at .7148 and the main Fibonacci level at .7153. This is the last potential resistance level before the .7168 main top. Bearish Scenario A sustained move under .7105 will signal the presence of sellers. This could drive the AUD/USD into a pair of uptrending Gann angles at .7088 and .7079. Taking out .7079 could trigger an acceleration to the downside with the next major targets .7064 and an uptrending Gann angle at .7046. The latter is the last major support before a 50% level at .7030.

Throwing money at it helps, but guarantees nothing. Richard Nixon also wanted to cure cancer during his presidency; the National Cancer Act of 1971 created the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health and funded it with $400 million that year (equivalent to $2.5 billion today). Trump\u2019s promised $50 million a year is a drop in the bucket (see also Science http://doi.org/c3xc; 2019 ).\nLast year, the NCI had a budget of almost $6 billion.

The yield curve is first and foremost predicting the outlook for Fed policy rather than the next recession. My research has confirmed this conclusion, as does a recent Fed study.\nIn my recent book, Predicting the Markets , Quote: : \u201cThe Yield Curve Model is based on investors\u2019 expectations of how the Fed will respond to inflation. It is more practical for predicting interest rates than is the Inflation Premium Model. It makes sense that the federal-funds rate depends mostly on the Fed\u2019s inflation outlook, and that all the other yields to the right of this rate on the yield curve are determined by investors\u2019 expectations for the Fed policy cycle.\u201d\nMore specifically, after studying the relationship between the yield curve and the monetary, credit, and business cycles, we have concluded that it is credit crunches, not inverted yield curve, and not aging economic expansions that cause recessions. The yield curve is just keeping score on how the Fed is reacting to and influencing these cycles. So why do inverted yield curves have such a good track record in calling recessions , and could it be different this time ?\n: The yield curve inverted \u2014 here are 5 things investors need to know\nAccording to a July 2018 Fed study about the yield curve, the probability of a recession was around 14%. However, a February 2019 update of this study reported that the odds had risen to 50%. That recession warning might have contributed to the remarkable pivot from a hawkish to a dovish stance by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets the Fed\u2019s monetary policy.\nThe Fed recently signaled that there won\u2019t be any rate hikes this year and only one next year. If so, this should reduce the chances of a recession. Let\u2019s have a close look at the Fed study, which confirms our view about the best interpretation of the yield curve:\nLast year, the minutes of the June 12-13 FOMC meeting offered a reason not to worry about the flattening yield curve at that time. During the meeting, Fed staff presented an alternative \u201cindicator of the likelihood of recession\u201d based on research explained in a June 28 FEDS Notes titled \u201c(Don't Fear) The Yield Curve\u201d by two Fed economists, Eric C. Engstrom and Steven A. Sharpe. In brief, they questioned why a \u201clong-term spread\u201d between the 10-year (BX:TMUBMUSD10Y) and two-year (BX:TMUBMUSD02Y) Treasury notes should have much power to predict imminent recessions. As an alternative, they devised a 0- to-6-quarter \u201cnear-term forward spread\u201d based on the spread between the current level of the federal-funds rate and the expected federal-funds rate several quarters ahead, derived from futures market prices ( Fig. 1 ).\nThe authors stressed that the long-term spread reflects the near-term spread, which they argue makes more sense as an indicator of a recession that is expected to occur within the next few quarters. They also observe that an inversion of either yield spread does not mean that the spread causes recessions.\nAt the time, their assessment was that \u2018the market is putting fairly low odds on a rate cut over the next four quarters,\u2019 i.e., 14.1% ( Fig. 2 ). \u201cUnlike far-term yield spreads, the near-term forward spread has not been trending down in recent years, and survey-based measures of longer-term expectations for short term interest rates show no sign of an expected inversion,\u201d they observed. In our commentary last year, we concluded: \u201cWhat a relief! So now, all we have to worry about is a recession caused by a trade war!\u201d\n(provided by The Street)\nClick to expand Replay Video UP NEXT Nor'easter strengthens off the East Coast An April Nor'easter is taking shape along the Carolina Coast which will impact the major metro cities of the Northeast by Wednesday.

The near-term spread \u201cpredicts four-quarter GDP growth with greater accuracy than survey consensus forecasts. Furthermore, \u201cit has substantial predictive power for stock returns,\u201d find the Fed economists. In contrast, yields on bonds \u201cmaturing beyond 6-8 quarters are shown to have no added value for forecasting either recessions, GDP growth, or stock returns.\u201d\nBuried on page 7 of the new study is a warning that the probability of a recession had increased significantly since the original study was done about a year ago: \u201cAs of the end of the sample period in early 2019 (and the time of this writing), the near term forward spreads forecast a substantially elevated probability of a recession.\u201d\nIndeed, Figure 3 in the study clearly shows that recession risk jumped to 50% (based on first-quarter 2019 data available only through January). Interestingly, this important update wasn\u2019t mentioned in the summary paragraph at the beginning of the study. However, the charts in the paper show that the odds of a recession increase most significantly when the near-term forward spread is markedly below zero, which it was not as of the most recent analysis.\nAccordingly, we\u2019re not freaking out about an impending recession. We are focusing on the idea promoted in the Fed study (and in my book) that the yield curve first and foremost is predicting the outlook for monetary policy. For example, the paper noted that \u201cthe near-term forward spread would tend to turn negative when investors decide that the Fed is likely to soon switch from a tightening to an easing stance.\u201d\nThe yield-curve spread tends to narrow during periods when the Fed is raising the federal-funds rate ( Fig. 3 ). It tends to bottom and then widen when the Fed starts to lower interest rates. It just so happens that past recessions occurred after the yield curve inverted, i.e., at the tail end of monetary tightening cycles.\nIt might be different this time, if the Fed has paused on a timely basis from raising interest rates any further, thus reducing the chances of a recession. After all, there\u2019s no need to overdo tightening given that inflation and speculative excesses remain subdued. In the past, Fed tightening (not inverted yield curves that coincided with tightening) led to financial crises, which morphed into widespread credit crunches, resulting in recessions ( Fig. 4 ).\nHence our conclusion that it is credit crunches that cause recessions, not inverted yield curves and not aging expansions.\nDrawing parallels between monetary policy in 1998 and today, Engstrom\u2019s and Sharpe\u2019s paper stated: \u201cThe most prominent false positive during our sample came with the anticipated easing triggered by the spread of the Asian financial crises in 1998, which did not result in a recession in the U.S. It is not hard to imagine that similar scenarios could generate additional false positives in the future. The near-inversion of the near term forward spread at the end of 2018 seems to have been associated with market perceptions of significant risks to the global economic outlook, including the threat of escalating trade disputes. Whether those risks manifest in a recession remains to be seen.\u201d\nThe Fed study notes: \u201cWe define the near-term forward spread on any given day as the difference between the implied interest rate expected on a three-month Treasury bill six quarters ahead and the current yield on a three-month Treasury bill.\u201d\nAccording to Haver Analytics (our data vendor): \u201cWe had been in touch with the Board about the 0-to-6 Quarter Forward Spread earlier this year and they had told us they calculated it using an internal fitted zero coupon curve in quarterly maturities. They only make annual maturities available at the moment so we cannot calculate.\u201d\nSo instead of trying to calculate the Fed study\u2019s near-term spread, we will focus on the 12-month forward futures for the federal-funds rate, which is available daily ( Fig. 5 ). The two-year Treasury note yield tracks this series closely, suggesting that it is also a good proxy for the market\u2019s prediction of the federal-funds rate a year from now.\nAfter all that work, the conclusion is the obvious one: The Fed isn\u2019t likely to be raising the federal-funds rate over the next 12 months. Last Monday, the 12-month forward rate was 2.06%, 32 basis points below the 2.38% midpoint of the federal-funds rate target range. The two-year was 2.24%, 14 basis points below the midpoint late last week.\nThe Fed study suggests to us that the spread between the two-year Treasury yield and the federal-funds rate may be the simplest way to track the fixed-income market\u2019s outlook for monetary policy over the next 52 weeks ( Fig. 6 ). Anyone can do this at home. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the market will be right, as evidenced by how wrong it turned out to be last year.\nThe bottom line: For now, we still don\u2019t see a significant risk of a recession, especially since the FOMC remains \u201cpatient.\u201d The committee\u2019s recent decision to pause hiking the federal-funds rate over the rest of this year reduces the risk of a financial crisis triggering both a credit crunch and a recession.\nEd Yardeni is president of Yardeni Research, Inc.

Muthana, then 19, was was seduced and went to join them.\n\u00a9 FoxNews.com Hoda Muthana, the Alabama woman fighting to return to the U.S. after joining ISIS in Syria, sits down with Fox News' Benjamin Hall to discuss her case. \"I didn\u2019t hate America\u201d she told Fox News. \u201cI didn\u2019t hate anything. I just thought it was obligatory \u2013 when I started practicing I was very scared of the concept of hellfire. The Koran told me to go.\u201d\nShe took some money earmarked for college, and got on a plane to Turkey, from where she was smuggled across the border to Syria. It was only then that she turned on a phone and called home \u2013 telling her mother she was with the terror group.\nThey have always condemned her move. She said she was \u2018brainwashed.\u201d\nOnce in the ISIS capital of Raqqa \u2013 she was held in a locked house for women until marrying. Her first husband, Suhan Rahman, was a well-known Australian fighter\nShe went on to marry two more men \u2013 all are now dead. She had a child who\u2019s now 19 months old. In the early days of the caliphate, life was alright, she was able get food, and fully embrace the ideology of the caliphate \u2013 even though it committed such terror.\nBut as the U.S.-led coalition began to tighten the noose, life became hard, food started to dry up. And when Presidnet Trump took office, he told the U.S. military to take the gloves off, at which point the airstrikes picked up and ISIS families were moved from one town to another. They eventually ended up in the town of Baghouz, where they made their last stand.\nToday, every ISIS member I speak to says they regret their decision. But it seems clear they only changed their mind when it became clear their caliphate had been defeated.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.foxnews.com/", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBVwJql.img&quot;},&quot;headlineImage&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBVwJql.img&quot;}}", "https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/syria", "https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump", "https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism/isis", "http://api.foxnews.com/v1/custom/partner/msn/section/world&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;displayAds&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/hoda-muthana", "https://www.foxnews.com/world/despite-a-crumpled-caliphate-hunt-for-baghdadi-continues-in-syria", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http:%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fBBVvfdE%3focid%3dst&text=ISIS+bride+claims+she%E2%80%99d+be+model+citizen+if+she&#39;s+allowed+to+return+to+US:+%E2%80%98I+didn%E2%80%99t+hate+America%E2%80%99&original_referer=http:%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fBBVvfdE%3focid%3dst", "https://2df7e.v.fwmrm.net&quot;,&quot;HybridPlayerAdInitTimeout&quot;:", "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/04/01/694940094001_6021283903001_6021276183001.mp4&quot;,&quot;shareUrl&quot;:&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/isis-bride-claims-shed-be-model-us-citizen-i-didnt-hate-america?cmpid=prn_msn&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;FOX", "https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fBBVvfdE%3focid%3dsw", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAywOab.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;ISIS", "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/how-do-we-know-isis-bride-hoda-muthana-isnt-still-working-for-the-group", "http://wus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/d807a91d-9cb9-4ba2-8e62-c0a45eb92a87/f315c558-531a-4b0c-8254-ac0611f0e15f.mp4&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1004&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://wus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/eaebccb4-caf1-42f4-8524-c0854943b80e/f315c558-531a-4b0c-8254-ac0611f0.ism/manifest&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1006&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://wus-streami", "https://www.foxnews.com/us/attorney-for-isis-bride-hoda-muthana-confident-she-will-return-to-us-we-are-very-likely-to-succeed", "http://wus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/eaebccb4-caf1-42f4-8524-c0854943b80e/f315c558-531a-4b0c-8254-ac0611f0.ism/manifest(format=mpd-time-csf)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;101&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://wus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/eaebccb4-caf1-42f4-8524-c0854943b80e/f315c558-531a-4b0c-8254-ac0611f0_650.mp4&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;}", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http:%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fBBVvfdE%3focid%3dsl&title=ISIS+bride+claims+she%E2%80%99d+be+model+citizen+if+she&#39;s+allowed+to+return+to+US:+%E2%80%98I+didn%E2%80%99t+hate+America%E2%80%99&source=http:%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fBBVvfdE%3focid%3dsl", "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/alabama-born-isis-wife-will-not-be-admitted-to-the-us-pompeo-says"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nipsey hussle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "isis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nipsey hussle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox news see", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carolina coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san diego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin hall click", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T17:15:43.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "891c33a07c403eb6b847518eed48c74900bc92da", "url": "https://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/melbourne-vic/a-few-weeks-later-he-tried-to-rob-us/news-story/07c4f2b7cc34da0f83cc230a4514bd6c", "site_full": "www.news.com.au", "site": "news.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/melbourne-vic", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Melbourne &amp;

The House Judiciary Committee plans to vote to authorize subpoenas for the report at a markup hearing Wednesday.\n\"The allegations at the center of special counsel Mueller's investigation strike at the core of our democracy,\" the Democrats wrote. \"Congress urgently needs his full, unredacted report and its underlying evidence in order to fulfill its constitutional role, including its legislative, appropriations, and oversight responsibilities.\"\nThey also want Barr to testify before Nadler's Judiciary Committee \u2014 \"not in a month, as you have offered, but now.\" Their topics for Barr will include his initial summary of the principal conclusions from the Mueller report and his decision to \"initiate a redaction process that withholds critical information from Congress.\"\nThe Democrats also asked Barr not to interfere with Mueller testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee or other panels after his report is released.\nRead the Democrats' letter to barr here.\nIn addition to Nadler of New York and Schiff of California, the other House committee chairs who made the demand are Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal of Massachusetts, Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters of California, Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Elijah Cummings of Maryland and Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel of New York.\nThe Justice Department declined to comment on the letter to Barr.\nBarr, who was confirmed by the Senate in February, has faced mounting criticism from Democrats since he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded that Mueller did not find sufficient evidence to merit a charge of obstruction of justice against President Donald Trump .\nThe attorney general shared that decision, as well as the report's conclusion that the special counsel did not establish collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, in a four-page summary less than two days after Mueller delivered his long-awaited report.\nBarr said he expects to deliver a version of the Mueller report to lawmakers by mid-April, \"if not sooner.\" But Democrats have called on Barr to give them the entire report without any redactions \u2014 something Barr has already signaled he will not do.\nBarr had recently assured lawmakers that the White House had no plans to exert executive privilege to review the report before it was shared with other parties or the public. Trump said to \"just release it,\" his close ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told CNN last week.\nIn a letter sent to Congress on Friday , Barr said the material from the report potentially being redacted includes grand jury-related information, as well as information that could reveal U.S. sources and methods or confidential details about ongoing investigations.\nBarr and Republicans have cited federal rules to support their claim that information in the report about grand juries cannot legally be made public.

With this, the Yaris moniker can now be found on three hatchbacks that share absolutely nothing with each other.\nYou see, while the European and Japanese markets soldier on with the third-generation Euro-centric model (which this car replaces in the United States) and the ASEAN market has its Vios-based equivalent, the North American model is based on the Mazda 2 . This follows in the footsteps of the existing Yaris Sedan , and it also means that Toyota is replacing an eight-year-old car with one that first made its debut in 2014 .\nAs with its four-door sibling, the Yaris hatch is practically identical to the donor car, with the exception of the radically redesigned front fascia. Here, you\u2019ll find a huge trapezoidal grille, the size of which is exaggerated by the lines that radiate from it, giving the car a rather Predator-like look. The range-topping XLE variant gets automatic LED headlights as standard, and 16-inch alloy wheels are fitted across the range.\nThe interior is also a direct carryover from the Mazda, right down to the full-width air vent design on the dashboard and the freestanding seven-inch touchscreen. The latter, together with the rotary controller between the front seats, is connected to a version of Mazda\u2019s MZD Connect infotainment system, now with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity as standard.\nOther standard features include keyless entry, push-button start, fog lights, heated door mirrors, tilt and telescopic steering adjustment, navigation (SD card maps sold separately) and a Low-speed Pre-collision Safety System with autonomous emergency braking. The XLE throws in faux leather upholstery and automatic climate control and wipers.\nThe engine, as you\u2019d expect, is also lifted straight from the Mazda \u2013 a 1.5 litre naturally-aspirated SkyActiv-G petrol engine making 106 hp and 140 Nm of torque.

Russell Bucklew was convicted of murder, kidnap and rape in 1996. The 50-year-old argued that death by lethal injection would cause him undue agony by rupturing blood-filled tumours on his face, head, neck and throat caused by a congenital condition called cavernous hemangioma. His lawyers said the death penalty was in violation of the US Constitution's Eighth Amendment, which bars cruel and unusual punishment. However, judges ruled 5-4 against Bucklew's appeal and said he had failed to present enough evidence for them to grant his request to be executed by lethal gas instead. They said Bucklew failed to show that lethal gas could be \"readily implemented\" as required under Supreme Court precedent, adding there was no evidence that his chosen alternative would be less painful. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote: \"The Eighth Amendment does not guarantee a prisoner a painless death - something that, of course, isn't guaranteed to many people, including most victims of capital crimes.\" The judge, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in 2017, also noted that Bucklew was awaiting execution for crimes he committed more than two decades ago. \"Yet since then, he has managed to secure delay through lawsuit after lawsuit,\" he added. A spokesman for Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt said: \"The state of Missouri and the victims of Russell Bucklew's crimes have waited 23 long years for this just and lawful sentence to be carried out. \"We are one step closer to justice.\" he added. Bucklew was convicted of murdering Michael Sanders, who was living with his ex-girlfriend Stephanie Ray at the time, at his trailer home and shooting at his six-year-old son. He was also convicted of kidnapping and raping his former girlfriend and wounding a police officer before he was arrested, according to court papers. Supreme Court judges' diverging opinions over the death penalty have come to light in recent cases. In February, the court allowed the execution of Muslim death row inmate Dominique Ray in Alabama to go ahead after his request for an imam to be present was rejected. In a turnaround, the court last week blocked the execution of Patrick Murphy in Texas because his Buddhist spiritual adviser was not allowed into the death chamber with him. ---Watch the latest videos from Yahoo UK--- ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bucklew", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russell bucklew", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sky news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "us supreme court", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "upreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T18:03:05.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7a054a8ec653cfb28f8a60d0b55746b519e80337", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/will-this-is-us-return-for-season-4-the-pearsons-still-have-more-story-to-tell-17001042", "site_full": "www.bustle.com", "site": "bustle.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Will 'This Is Us' Return For Season 4?

The Pearsons Still Have More Story To Tell", "text": "27 min ago Ron Batzdorff/NBC\nThe Pearson family has overcome many obstacles throughout the years, but it seems as though their biggest challenges are still to come. Beth and Randall's marriage is on very thin ice right now and Tuesday's promo seems to indicate that Kate and Toby's son isn't out of the woods just yet. Hopefully, the Season 3 finale will provide some closure for some these plot points, though, given this show's love of cliffhangers it seems unlikely. So will This Is Us return for Season 4 or is there a chance these storylines won't ever get the opportunity to finish unfolding?\nAt this point in time, NBC has yet to officially renew This Is Us for a fourth season. However, before you start panicking, it's important to note that it's still a little early for renewals and seasonal pickups to be announced, so there's plenty of time for it to happen. Additionally, it's worth mentioning that the show's producers intend for the series to last through Season 6 and have the whole plan pretty much mapped out. During an interview with Deadline back in February, producer and showrunner Isaac Aptaker revealed that he and his creative team are roughly planning \"about three seasons in the future\u201d before ending the series for good.\nHe added, \"We\u2019ve had this end in mind for a long time, so we\u2019re able to plan for it, and try to make it feel like it\u2019s a whole, as opposed to a series that\u2019s going to go endlessly.\u201d Giphy\nObviously, the idea of the This Is Us coming to a close is almost as sad as finally learning how Jack died. ( Almost .) But with that information in mind, it feels pretty inevitable that the show will continue on for another season at least. In fact, series creator Dan Fogelman also has a good idea of where he wants the next season to go. \u201cWe\u2019ve got multiple seasons mapped out,\u201d Fogelman said during the same Deadline interview. \u201cI think this season has been a lot about redemption, but also a lot of rebirth. Next season is a season of new beginnings and restarts.\u201d\nBasically, the biggest takeaway from all this should be that if both Aptaker and Fogelman aren't worried about the show's future, then we shouldn't be either. It's doubtful they'd already been planning out the next season if they didn't whole-heartedly think the show would be returning. Sure, it'd be nice if NBC would just go ahead and greenlight Season 4 to help ease our worry, but much like the show itself, the network is preferring to keep us on the edge of our seats. Giphy\nAnd hey, who knows, maybe when the renewal comes it'll be a double-season pickup like what happened back in January 2017 when NBC renewed This Is Us for Season 2 and Season 3 at the same time. Either way, the fate of this series seems pretty secure for the time being, so sit back, relax, and just enjoy the final episode of Season 3 \u2014 though you may want to have some tissues on hand.

This Flash-Forward Mystery Still Has To Play Out Soon 23 min ago Ron Batzdorff/NBC\nOne of the biggest mysteries surrounding the first half of Season 3 revolved around fans trying their best to figure out who the mysterious \"Her\" was in the This Is Us flash-forwards. And while the fall finale seemed to deliver a huge clue in that regard, we have yet to see the full story unfold on-screen. So when will \"Her\" be revealed on This Is Us ? Even if we now know the person's identity, there are still quite a few details missing from this puzzle.\nThis storyline began at the very end of Season 2, when a future, older version of Randall went to go visit his now grown up daughter, Tess, at work to tell her, \u201cIt\u2019s time to go see her,\u201d and Tess responded by saying, \u201cI\u2019m not ready.\u201d Randall echoed that sentiment by admitting: \u201cI'm not either.\" Since then, viewers have been desperately searching for clues to figure out who this unknown person could be. Then in November, that answer seemed to be confirmed when another glimpse into the future showed Beth working at her very own dance studio and getting informed that her family (Randall and Tess) were on their way to her.\n\"We\u2019re all going to see Randall\u2019s mother,\u201d Beth explained, right before adding: \u201cOh, did you bring the Pin the Tail on the Donkey from the office? I promised I'd bring it.\u201d\nTaking all of that into consideration, it appears as though Rebecca is the \"Her\" in question and is still alive at this point in time, though, it's still unclear what's happening to bring the whole family together and why they don't seem to be very exited about it. Giphy\nGiven that Rebecca would be significantly older at this point in the future, an easy assumption to make would be that Rebecca is ill and that this gathering is meant to be almost like a goodbye party for her. Then again, this show isn't exactly known for its predictability, so it's very possible something else could be at work here that will throw another shocking twist into the mix.\nWhen asked about Rebecca's role in the flash-forward scenes , series creator Dan Fogelman told Entertainment Weekly that there's still a lot to unpack from the small snippets of scenes from the future we've been privy to thus far. \"The only thing that is made clear at the end of this episode is that they\u2019re going to see her,\" Fogelman told the outlet, adding: \"We certainly answered the question about who everyone was going to see, who everyone\u2019s been talking about. Exactly what that looks like and what that is \u2014 it takes a lot more present-day story to fill in the gaps to understand the future.\" Giphy\nAs for when we can expect the show to further fill in some of these blanks, Fogelman remains as vague as ever. \"The answers will come, and it becomes a very big part of the show,\" he teased to EW . \"But we are doing a multiple-season television show, so it will take a minute to see the rest of that puzzle take shape.\"\nBut given that the episode for the Season 3 finale is titled \"Her,\" it's safe to assume we'll at least get a little more information about what's going on with Future Rebecca, however, there's a decent change part of this mystery could continue on into Season 4 and beyond.

That means, given the current overall gender wage gap, women worked an extra 92 days to earn the same amount as men did in 2018 \u2014 a staggering number, but one that doesn't even fully account for the larger gaps that women of color, older women, trans women, and women in a range of other groups experience. To mark this occasion, equal pay advocate and actor Laura Dern executive producedenergy nut brand NUT-trition's campaign to shine a light on the gender wage gap and help bring the issue to the forefront in a creative way. As part of that partnership, Dern spoke with Bustle over the phone about her experiences with the wage gap, how the culture surrounding it is changing, and why the issue is close to her heart.\n\"As women, watching the numbers crawl from when our mothers were going through this and what we're doing now... the numbers have not changed. There's been a 20 percent difference [in pay] for at least the last 10 or 15 years,\" Dern tells Bustle. \"In my experience, and in my industry, that difference can be 80 percent from what the male lead in a film will be paid compared to the female lead \u2014 for the same work, or perhaps more work.\"\nDern's acting career is a lengthy and prominent one, with roles that have earned her four Golden Globes , an Emmy, and two Academy Award nominations. She was also no stranger to Hollywood growing up, as the daughter of two actors . But when it comes to how the gender wage gap has affected the choices Dern made in her career, her answer is refreshingly frank.\n\"I'm going to answer that question as honestly as I try to answer any, and hopefully it can be as helpful as it is for me when other women are transparent \u2014 which is, when I started, I wouldn't ask questions. I'd be grateful for the job and I'd be told that if I didn't just accept it, they'd move on to a long list of women who would be thrilled just to have the opportunity for no money,\" Dern tells Bustle. \"And the reason there has been such a massive change is women are talking to each other, women are being transparent with each other about their experience, about they make, about what their working conditions are.\"\nDern attributes the changing culture around the wage gap not just to women being more open with each other and vocal about their experiences, but also in allyship \u2014 in recognizing that this issue affects groups of women in different ways , particularly women of color and women in vulnerable industries.\n\"It's 20 percent difference in terms of the gender pay gap. But those numbers do not include people of color,\" says Dern to Bustle, alluding to the fact that, though April 2 marks Equal Pay Day for women \"overall,\" for specific groups that day will come much later. Per Equal Pay Today , it will come for Black women on Aug. 22, 2019, for Native American women on Sept. 23, 2019, and for Latinx woman on Nov. 20, 2019 \u2014 dates figured from the 61 cents, 58 cents, and 53 cents women in those groups make on the average dollar for men, respectively.\n\"As a single mom, I have met so many women, particularly in the last year, across all industries \u2014 restaurant workers, female farm workers ... the gender wage gap is devastating in these communities, and they didn't feel they would be listened to,\" Dern tells Bustle. \"And now they're finding fellow workers to stand up for them, and advocates \u2014 and we need to do that across all lines, across all industries, to all stand up together and do that.\"\nAnother easy way to fight the wage gap, according to Dern? Something you're probably already doing every day: talking in the group chat. Dern shares with Bustle that the group text between her costars on Big Little Lies has been instrumental not just in helping support each other and women's causes like the gender wage gap.\n\"We use [the group text] to support each other, but we also use it to inform each other. And there's always one of us who's learning something new,\" Dern tells Bustle. \"We didn't do that 10 years ago. We weren't even working with other women on set. So now we have a community \u2014 let's use it, and do what women do best. You know, forever there was a a judgment on the fact, 'Women are always talking to each other,' right? They're always 'chitchatting.' Yeah, we're going to use our voices and we're going to make a difference.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "equa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "laura dern", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bustle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dern", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T18:07:01.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e9ff5f4d392044aae40d5c9ed41a2011756959fe", "url": "https://article.wn.com/view/2019/04/02/US_mulling_more_sanctions_targeting_Irans_economy/", "site_full": "article.wn.com", "site": "wn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.wn.com/English/keyword/mideast", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WN.com -

Put simply, ON Semiconductor expects that the addition of Quantenna to its business portfolio will expand the former's served addressable market (SAM) by $4.3 billion by 2022.\nAnd, to boot, ON Semiconductor claims that Quantenna's business has \"minimal overlap in end-markets and consumers,\" so ON Semiconductor isn't really paying for much that it already had in house.\nNow, to be fair, while ON Semiconductor talked up the large SAM expansion, keep in mind that Quantenna's revenue in 2018 was just shy of $221 million -- up 25% from the prior year. So while adding Quantenna to the portfolio allows ON Semiconductor to go after a much larger opportunity, it'll still need to work to capture a bigger slice of it.\nFor some context, ON Semiconductor itself generated $5.88 billion in revenue in 2018, so the addition of Quantenna's revenue isn't going to have a profound impact on ON Semiconductor's overall financial results in the near term.\nLet's talk numbers It's worth noting that although ON Semiconductor's and Quantenna's businesses don't really overlap, the former has signaled to investors that there will be some cost synergies associated with the transaction. In particular, ON Semiconductor says that there will be $26 million of \"annual operational synergies run rate within one year of close\" and that the source of those synergies will be in both cost of goods sold (COGS) and \"general and administrative functions.\"\nConsidering that Quantenna's total operating expenses were about $106.6 million in 2018, that $26 million in \"operational synergies\" is actually quite significant and should dramatically increase the company's operating income, which was just $2.81 million in 2018.\nAnd the good news is that the cost reductions don't appear to be affecting the company's research and development spending -- the fuel that powers the development of future technologies and products.\nThe deal, ON Semiconductor says, will be \"immediately accretive to non- GAAP [generally accepted accounting principles] earnings and free cash flow.\" What this means is that once the deal has closed and Quantenna's financial results become part of ON Semiconductor's, the latter will see a boost in both non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) and free cash flow .\nInvestor takeaway Ultimately, ON Semiconductor's strategic rationale behind this deal looks sound. ON Semiconductor isn't getting a screaming bargain at the proposed purchase price, which is about 22 times what analysts expect Quantenna's EPS to be in 2020. However, if Quantenna continues to grow rapidly and if the cost synergies that ON Semiconductor expects to achieve actually happen, then the price ON Semiconductor is paying will probably, in hindsight, seem quite fair.\nNow, one thing that might be frustrating to some Quantenna shareholders is that the company's shares, during their relatively brief time on the public markets (Quantenna's IPO happened in late 2016), actually traded briefly above the $24.50 purchase price about two years ago. So any shareholders who actually paid more than $24.50 for the stock and held on might not even walk away with a profit.\nNevertheless, with a price of $24.50, most shareholders are probably going to walk away with profits as a result of this acquisition, and those who bought at Quantenna's actual peak will see their losses minimized, so this looks like a pretty good deal all around.\n10 stocks we like better than ON Semiconductor\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Rather, it\u2019s the vast majority of us who are sick to the craw of being over-taxed, over-regulated and over-propagandised in the name of a non-existent problem.\n\u2018Global warming\u2019 is a man-made scare story.\nThe polar bears are doing so well they are in danger of becoming a plague.\nThe Pacific islands are not about to sink beneath the waves.\nBat-chomping, bird-slicing eco-crucifixes do far more obvious environmental damage than even coal-fired power stations.\nNuclear is far cleaner than renewable energy.\nAll normal, sensible people know this stuff which is why doing something about climate change comes very low on their list of priorities.\nYet in this bizarre Looking Glass world of ours, where values are inverted, and where the people with the least of value to say tend to make the most noise, climate change has become a political issue out of all proportion to its actual significance.\nBritain\u2019s supposedly Conservative government is as wedded to climate change as any of its Labour predecessors. The \u00a3300 billion Climate Change Act remains very much on the statute books, driving up the costs of living, hampering economic growth, sending the vulnerable into fuel poverty, making business less competitive, uglifying the landscape with expensive, nasty, inefficient solar and wind installations.\nNot one senior member of the government dares speak out against the scam.\nNor is it easy to find anyone in the mainstream media reporting the issue accurately.\nWorst offender is, of course, the BBC \u2013 which has long since given up all pretence of impartiality on this issue, despite the fact that its green advocacy is anathema to a sizeable minority and possibly even the majority of its viewers and listeners.\nAlmost daily it bombards us with environmental propaganda which often bears no relation to the actual facts. The BBC\u2019s climate news is #fakenews and licence-fee payers who object to this appear to have little recourse against it other than the mild satisfaction of a rare \u201cupheld\u201d complaint.\nIn the last two years, for example, Paul Homewood has had no fewer than eight complaints upheld about the BBC\u2019s nakedly dishonest environmental coverage:\nThe false claims made by the BBC were:\nSea levels at Miami rising ten times the global mean.\nTens of thousands of reindeer are being killed by climate change\nClimate change is making hurricanes worse.\nNew onshore wind farms have been banned.\nSince 2005 floods have increased by 15 times, extreme temperature events by 20 times, wildfires by 7 times\nPenguin numbers in South Africa are being hit by climate change.\nEvery one of these claims is so far wrong it is not even in the ballpark of true. Each one is quite simply a bare-faced lie.\nAs the BBC leads, so does the rest of the Establishment follow: the politicians in Westminster and in local government; the Civil Service; the universities; big business, the City law firms; the schools; the mainstream media.\nThose idiots baring their butt cheek in parliament yesterday weren\u2019t saying anything new or valuable \u2013 or true. They were merely left-wing activists pushing at an open door in a parliament dominated by lazy, ignorant, cowardly MPs who wouldn\u2019t dream of challenging the (false) environmental consensus lest they be made to look uncaring.\nMeanwhile in the real world, the rest of us look on aghast.\nAs with Brexit, so it is with Climate Change: the best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity.\nEnvironment London / Europe Politics Climate Change Extinction Rebellion Global Warming house of commons naked nude protest scam", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-715222-1", "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/font-awesome@4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css", "https://media.brei", "https://www.thegwpf.org/content/uploads/2016/12/CCACost-Dec16.pdf", "https://www.googletagservices.com/tag/js/gpt.js", "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/animate.css@3.5.2/animate.min.css", "https://notalotofpeopleknowthat.wordpress.com/2019/03/15/bbcs-climate-lies-becoming-a-habit/", "https://notalotofpeopleknowthat.wordpress.com/2019/03/27/latest-global-polar-bear-abundance-best-guess-estimate-is-39000-26000-58000/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stabber roams khan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "james delingpole", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james heappey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "climate change truth  brexit anarchy spree", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "house of commons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T18:53:04.034+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "44ddcd7a78ccbb619b2e02ff09e567ae936b001b", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/04/02/stock-market-news-walgreens-weighs-on-the-dow-slac.aspx", "site_full": "www.fool.com", "site": "fool.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Stock Market News: Walgreens Weighs on the Dow; Slack Goes Direct With NYSE -- The Motley Fool", "title_full": "Stock Market News: Walgreens Weighs on the Dow; Slack Goes Direct With NYSE -- The Motley Fool", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.991, "main_image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/517918/wba-store.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1336, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "44ddcd7a78ccbb619b2e02ff09e567ae936b001b", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/04/02/stock-market-news-walgreens-weighs-on-the-dow-slac.aspx", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dan Caplinger", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Stock Market News: Walgreens Weighs on the Dow; Slack Goes Direct With NYSE -- The Motley Fool", "text": "Stock Market News: Walgreens Weighs on the Dow; Slack Goes Direct With NYSE April 02, 2019, 11:22:54 AM EDT By Dan Caplinger, Motley Fool\nTuesday got off to a sluggish start on Wall Street, as market participants reined in the enthusiasm that produced healthy gains on Monday. Worries about the U.K.'s potential exit from the European Union weighed against signs of a stronger economy in China. As of 11:12 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) was down 129 points to 26,133. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) fell 7 points to 2,860, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) dropped 14 points to 7,814.\nOne of the newest members of the Dow is Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) , and the drugstore chain's latest quarterly results had a pronounced influence on that illustrious benchmark this morning. Meanwhile, privately held workplace messaging specialist Slack Technologies looks like it's made a decision about where it expects to list its shares once it goes public -- although it's taking a page from the playbook of music-streaming company Spotify (NYSE: SPOT) in how it's doing so. Walgreens looks a little ill\nShares of Walgreens Boots Alliance were down 12% after the drugstore chain gian t report ed its fiscal second-quarter financial results. Walgreens said that its sales for the quarter were up almost 5% from the year-ago period, but the company's bottom line went in the wrong direction. Adjusted operating income was down more than 10%, and a 5% drop in earnings per share was far worse than the modest gain that most of those following the stock were expecting to see.\nImage source: Walgreens.\nCEO Stefano Pessina didn't pull any punches, calling the period \"the most difficult quarter we have had since the formation of Walgreens Boots Alliance.\" Pessina pointed to pressure on reimbursement rates for prescriptions, generic pricing, and weakness from consumers in both the U.S. and U.K. markets.\nAs a result of the weakness, Walgreens cut its earnings guidance for the full fiscal year. The drugstore giant now expects flat adjusted earnings for the year, down from its previous projection for growth of 7% to 12%.\nIn response, Walgreens plans to redouble its efforts to reduce costs over the next several years. In addition, the company will work on transforming its retail locations with what it calls \"in-store neighborhood health destinations\" designed to draw more traffic. Walgreens hopes that those measures will yield better results in fiscal 2020, but even though the shares have looked relatively cheap for some time , investors weren't in a mood to be patient today. Slack heads for the NYSE\nSlack Technologies has been one of the most highly anticipated IPOs of the year , and many investors are looking forward to having a chance to invest in the fast-growing workplace messaging specialist. It now appears that when they get their chance, it'll be through a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange.\nDirect listings differ from traditional IPOs in the process that they follow. With most IPOs, Wall Street financial companies act as underwriters, finding investors who are willing to participate in the offering by buying shares. The sale of those shares happens immediately before the stock begins trading on public stock markets. By contrast, with a direct listing, the company itself sells shares directly to the public on the stock exchange.\nSlack isn't the first company to go this route. Last year, Spotify did a direct listing on the NYSE, and although the share price has had its ups and downs since, most participants seemed to be happy with how the process went.\nMost of those following Slack believe that the offering will take place around the beginning of summer. That gives investors some time to look more closely at Slack's business and whether they want to own a piece of it.\n10 stocks we like better than Walgreens Boots Alliance When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It is just the latest in a string of issues fueling tension between Berlin and Washington.\nThere arguably would never have been a good moment for Berlin to renege on its planned increase in defense spending. But to do it in the run-up to NATO celebrating its 70th anniversary in Washington is particularly bad timing.\nWhile Washington had grudgingly accepted Berlin's explanation that it could not meet NATO's goal that members spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024, Germany's latest projection that it now won't even meet the 1.5 percent mark it set itself was met with dismay.\n\"There is very little understanding in the United States, quite frankly \u2014 whether among Republicans or Democrats \u2014 for the German government's reluctance to meet the 2 percent of the GDP spending target,\" said Jeff Rathke, president of the American Institute for Contemporary Studies at Johns Hopkins University, \"and even less understanding for the current wobbliness with respect to the 1.5 percent of GDP target which Chancellor Merkel and other German leaders just a few months ago affirmed.\"\nTrump weighing in?\nRepublican Senator Rand Paul, a member of the foreign relations committee, lashed out on Twitter at Berlin's projected military spending, writing that \"Germany expects the US to pay for their defense.\"\nPresident Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Germany's defense spending, has not yet publicly weighed in on the issue, but that could still happen in the coming days, for instance when he is scheduled to meet NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday, said Karen Donfried, president of the German Marshall Fund.\nTrump has previously been critical of NATO and Germany\n\"I am sure this issue will come up,\" she said. \"And we have seen Jens Stoltenberg be very effective in making the case that European defense spending is increasing. And in fact the president mentioned NATO in a positive light in the state of the union address on that point of the allies spending more. So that becomes a little bit difficult when Europe's largest economy, Germany, isn't going to make forward progress on that goal.\"\nWhat's more, Germany's latest defense spending numbers provide fodder for critics inside and outside of the White House who question the country's commitment to NATO and the usefulness of the alliance itself.\nFuel for NATO skeptics\n\"I think to some extent it plays into the hands of folks who have been on the kind of far end of the spectrum and who have this narrative of Europe as our foes and that the Europeans are a bunch of free-riders,\" said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, director of the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.\nOn the whole, Germany, and the role it plays as a key US ally in Europe and beyond, still enjoys broad support from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers in Congress, noted the scholars. But the move threatens to chip away at the public perception that Germany is a reliable player at a time when trans-Atlantic ties are challenged by a US president who is deeply skeptical about Washington's European allies and especially Germany.\n\"It is not a good idea to put at risk the strong bipartisan consensus in the United States in support of NATO,\" said Rathke.\nSome US-based scholars argue Germany should honor the commitment it made\nDomestic politics 'no excuse'\nDonfried and Rathke, both deeply familiar with German domestic politics, acknowledge that internal partisan wrangling and positioning inside the country's grand coalition government explain part of the move, especially with European Parliament and state elections looming in a country where Trump is highly unpopular. They also appreciate Berlin's argument that its contribution to NATO and international security should not only measured by its percentage-based defense spending increases.\nStill, they contend that does not suffice as an explanation \u2014 neither from a German nor from a US perspective.\n\"We can explain the domestic politics, but I still think that that does not excuse Germany from not fulfilling things it has publicly committed itself to,\" said Donfried. \"So even those of us who consider themselves as strong friends of Germany feel that it's important, again for Germany, to make that investment in its military.\"\nComplicating matters further, Berlin's defense spending is only the latest among a range of contested issues between the US and German governments: President Trump's threat to impose tariffs on German cars, US opposition to both the planned Nord Stream 2 pipeline and Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to build Germany's new 5G network \u2014 all have increased the friction between Washington and Berlin.\nHowever, what the US observers of German politics find particularly disappointing is that Berlin, more than two years into Trump's term, is still grappling with what his presidency means in practical terms for Germany's foreign and security policy, said Kendall-Taylor.\n\"I think it underscores this dynamic where we see Germany kind of flounder in its efforts to define a path forward,\" she said. \"So Germany and Germans have articulated that they want greater autonomy from the United States and yet they are unwilling to invest in the capacity that greater autonomy would require.\" Watch video 01:55", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeff rathke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johns ho", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american institute for contemporary studies", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "americas frustration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T19:11:21.163+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a6a1cd74e9cb8b6a9dcd36e0fd40c5dbb26a634", "url": "https://www.dw.com/cda/en/aerodata-software-outage-delays-hundreds-of-us-regional-flights/a-48152813", "site_full": "www.dw.com", "site": "dw.com", "site_section": "http://rss.dw-world.de/rdf/rss-en-all", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Deutsche Welle", "title": "AeroData software outage delays hundreds of US regional flights", "title_full": "AeroData software outage delays hundreds of US regional flights", "published": "2019-04-01T21:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.dw.com/image/48152803_304.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2099, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3a6a1cd74e9cb8b6a9dcd36e0fd40c5dbb26a634", "url": "https://www.dw.com/cda/en/aerodata-software-outage-delays-hundreds-of-us-regional-flights/a-48152813", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-01T21:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "AeroData software outage delays hundreds of US regional flights", "text": "News AeroData software outage delays hundreds of US regional flights US airlines were affected by a system-wide computer outage after the Aerodata planning and balance system went down. It is the last application used by pilots before the entry door is closed.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration told passengers to contact their carriers to assess delays as nearly 3,000 flights were delayed because of the outage which lastest 40 minutes on Monday morning.\nAirlines affected included Delta, United, JetBlue, Southwest and Alaska.\nSouthwest experienced most of the delays (18 percent of the total) although that could also have been caused by ongoing issues around the grounding of Boeing 737 Max jets. Southwest delayed 620 early flights.\nSkyWest, a commuter airline affiliated with United and Delta Airlines, delayed 200 flights and United Continental had about 150 regional flights delayed.\nBy midday the airlines were working to get their flights back on schedule. Air traffic booming around the world Crowded skies\nMore passengers mean more aircraft in use. Asia's fleet for instance is set to be twice as big by 2035 to total about 17,000 planes. North America will have some 9,800 aircraft and Europe's about 7,900 (up from 4,610 today). Air traffic booming around the world Pilots in high demand\nMore planes in use mean more pilots are needed. Boeing reckons that about 617,000 new pilots will have to be recruited by 2035, particularly in Asia. On top of that, there's a need for 679,000 new maintenance staff and 814,000 additional flight assistants, says Boeing. Airbus sees a need for 560,000 new pilots. Air traffic booming around the world The biggest hubs\nEurope's biggest hubs in terms of passenger numbers are London Heathrow, Paris-Charles De Gaulle and Frankfurt in Germany, handling between 73 million and 64 million passengers. In Frankfurt, over 2 million tons of cargo were dealt with in 2014. The world's largest airport in Atlanta in the US boasted 100 million passengers in 2015. Air traffic booming around the world Budget airlines to the rescue\nGrowth at German aviation hubs is not so much a result of booming German carriers. It's more about the strength of foreign airlines. The number of German carriers' take-offs has shrunk steadily over the past six years. By contrast, no-frills competitors such as Ryanair and Easyjet have seen a 14-percent rise in take-offs from German airports. Air traffic booming around the world Largest strike action in history\nGerman flagship carrier Lufthansa was able to log 1.8 billion euros ($1.94 billion) in profit last year, beating results from a year earlier and despite a series of strikes crippling the airline. Industrial action organized by the VC pilots' union since 2014 has cost Lufthansa about half a billion euros. Meanwhile, management and pilots have struck a deal in principle. Air traffic booming around the world The biggest earners\nAviation is a lucrative business, but some market players do better than others. While airlines tend to get a 4-percent yield on their invested capital, German airport operators and plane manufacturers secure between 6 and 7 percent. Doing even better are air traffic control, haulers and booking services, which - says a McKinsey study - can get as much as 20 percent in proceeds from capital. Air traffic booming around the world What's in store for us?\nHere you are: beds for tired travelers, massagers and generous legroom, childcare services and a bar plus shower cabinets to make you feel alright. This is what passengers hope they will see on board in the not-too-distant future. Should this become a reality, passenger numbers are bound to soar further. Author: Insa Wrede (hg)\nPlanning and balance since 1990\nThe Aerodata planning and balance system is used to evenly distribute weight on planes. It is particularly important for airlines operating regional and commuter flights.\nPilots rely on it as it is the last application they use before the aircraft entry door is closed before takeoff.

Worries about the U.K.'s potential exit from the European Union weighed against signs of a stronger economy in China. As of 11:12 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJINDICES:^DJI ) was down 129 points to 26,133. The S&P 500 ( SNPINDEX:^GSPC ) fell 7 points to 2,860, and the Nasdaq Composite ( NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC ) dropped 14 points to 7,814.\nOne of the newest members of the Dow is Walgreens Boots Alliance ( NASDAQ:WBA ) , and the drugstore chain's latest quarterly results had a pronounced influence on that illustrious benchmark this morning. Meanwhile, privately held workplace messaging specialist Slack Technologies looks like it's made a decision about where it expects to list its shares once it goes public -- although it's taking a page from the playbook of music-streaming company Spotify ( NYSE:SPOT ) in how it's doing so.\nWalgreens looks a little ill Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance were down 12% after the drugstore chain giant reported its fiscal second-quarter financial results. Walgreens said that its sales for the quarter were up almost 5% from the year-ago period, but the company's bottom line went in the wrong direction. Adjusted operating income was down more than 10%, and a 5% drop in earnings per share was far worse than the modest gain that most of those following the stock were expecting to see.\nImage source: Walgreens.\nCEO Stefano Pessina didn't pull any punches, calling the period \"the most difficult quarter we have had since the formation of Walgreens Boots Alliance.\" Pessina pointed to pressure on reimbursement rates for prescriptions, generic pricing, and weakness from consumers in both the U.S. and U.K. markets.\nAs a result of the weakness, Walgreens cut its earnings guidance for the full fiscal year. The drugstore giant now expects flat adjusted earnings for the year, down from its previous projection for growth of 7% to 12%.\nIn response, Walgreens plans to redouble its efforts to reduce costs over the next several years. In addition, the company will work on transforming its retail locations with what it calls \"in-store neighborhood health destinations\" designed to draw more traffic. Walgreens hopes that those measures will yield better results in fiscal 2020, but even though the shares have looked relatively cheap for some time , investors weren't in a mood to be patient today.\nSlack heads for the NYSE Slack Technologies has been one of the most highly anticipated IPOs of the year , and many investors are looking forward to having a chance to invest in the fast-growing workplace messaging specialist. It now appears that when they get their chance, it'll be through a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange.\nDirect listings differ from traditional IPOs in the process that they follow. With most IPOs, Wall Street financial companies act as underwriters, finding investors who are willing to participate in the offering by buying shares. The sale of those shares happens immediately before the stock begins trading on public stock markets. By contrast, with a direct listing, the company itself sells shares directly to the public on the stock exchange.\nSlack isn't the first company to go this route. Last year, Spotify did a direct listing on the NYSE, and although the share price has had its ups and downs since, most participants seemed to be happy with how the process went.\nMost of those following Slack believe that the offering will take place around the beginning of summer. That gives investors some time to look more closely at Slack's business and whether they want to own a piece of it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "walgreens", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walgreens boots alliance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spotify", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gspc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wall street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T19:40:31.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ad9e823a7f5770c2fe5c03869ce01b1eb4912ab9", "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/weather/topstories/long-term-flooding-remains-a-concern-in-central-us-as-rivers-continue-to-rise/ar-BBVx9OA", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/weather/news", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "News - Weather - msn", "title": "Long-term flooding remains a concern in central US as rivers continue to rise", "title_full": "Long-term flooding remains a concern in central US as rivers continue to rise", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.958, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ad9e823a7f5770c2fe5c03869ce01b1eb4912ab9", "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/weather/topstories/long-term-flooding-remains-a-concern-in-central-us-as-rivers-continue-to-rise/ar-BBVx9OA", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "alex.sosnowski", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Long-term flooding remains a concern in central US as rivers continue to rise", "text": "Long-term flooding remains a concern in central US as rivers continue to rise AccuWeather 1 day ago alex.sosnowski While some rivers have crested, others continue to rise and may not crest until the middle to latter part of April over parts of the central United States.\nSnow from the winter has melted across much of the Plains and Midwest.

This is evident from the company's recent move of entering into a memorandum of understanding with Cuba-based telecommunications service provider, ETECSA, in order to strengthen Internet connectivity in Cuba where people still lack proper internet coverage and speed. Both the search giant and ETECSA, which enjoys monopoly in Cuba, will collaborate to work on the development of a direct connection between their networks which in turn will improve the Internet traffic exchange. Cuba Holds Promise Cuba is experiencing increasing demand for Internet connection and services. Further, the smartphone usage penetration in the country is growing. The roll out of 3G wireless mobile telecommunications technology by ETECSA in the country at the end of 2018 is a testament to the above-mentioned facts. Until this, the citizens of Cuba only had access to home Internet and public Wi-Fi hotspots. Consequently, Google's latest move will help it to cater to the ongoing digitization in Cuba. In fact, the company is well poised to leverage the benefits of growing Internet and smartphone usage in the country. Additionally, the setup of Internet traffic exchange service as part of the deal will offer faster access to Google's content on its servers in the country. Further, the move will help Google in strengthening footprint in Cuba. Apart from the recent deal, the company had installed Internet servers in the country in early 2017 to enable users to access its content stored on these servers.\nAlphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM)\nFocus on Connectivity & Bolstering Global Presence\nGoogle's deepening focus on ensuring high speed Internet services worldwide remains a major positive. The company's strong Internet servers, robust Wi-Fi service and Project Loon are the key catalysts in expanding its footprint in the international regions, especially in emerging markets. In 2018, it won a contract of connecting Kenyan rural areas via Internet with the aid of the Internet beaming balloons of its Project Loon. Notably, Google was successful in launching its balloons from Puerto Rico and moving them toward Peru. Further, Google strengthened its position in India by winning the RailTel WiFi project. Per the project, the company made Internet accessible at 400 railway stations of the country. The company is also trying to connect the rural India with the Internet balloons of Project Loon. Additionally, the company has launched Google Wi-Fi mesh router system, which provides advanced Wi-Fi connectivity at home, by teaming up with Singapore-based, StarHub. All these endeavors augur well for Google's strong focus toward expansion of connectivity business. Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider Currently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Unregulated structures will be rebuilt.\nAs part of the plan, the authority will also be responsible for the development and infrastructure work, while the construction of the houses will be carried out by the residents.\nAccording to the plan, Bedouin residents who will be relocated from their current unrecognized residence will receive a compensation of 250,000 new shekels.\nResidents who will stay in their rebuilt homes will be compensated by half the amount.
