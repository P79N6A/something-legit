Branches, however, fell outside that purview, as they are legally part of the overseas parent.\nOn resolution plans, otherwise known as \"living wills,\" the Fed was given discretion under the new law to ease requirements for banks with less than $250 billion in assets.

Advertisement\n\"The FAA will not approve the software for installation until the agency is satisfied with the submission,\" he added.\nThe FAA statement is the bureaucratic equivalent of a \"stop\" sign after Boeing officials touted their proposed remedy last week during a media tour at the company's manufacturing plant in Seattle, Washington.\nBoeing's 737 MAX planes were grounded globally last month following the second of two deadly crashes to occur in less than five months.\nScrutiny has centred on an anti-stall system developed specifically for the planes that has given pilots problems. Advertisement Advertisement\nA preliminary report into the second calamity - the Mar 10 crash of a Boeing 737 MAX 8 that killed 157 people - will likely be issued this week, the Ethiopian government said on Monday.\nBoeing last week gathered hundreds of pilots and reporters at its Renton, Washington manufacturing site for a presentation on proposed changes to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which is believed to have been a key factor in the Ethiopian crash and in an October crash of a Lion Air in Indonesia that killed 189 people.\nAmong the changes, the MCAS will no longer repeatedly make corrections when the pilot tries to regain control, and will automatically disconnect in the event of disagreements between the two \"angle of attack,\" or AOA sensors, the company said last week.\nBoeing is anxious to win approval for a proposed remedy that could get the planes back in the air.\nBut the FAA, which faced harsh questioning last week at a congressional hearing regarding its oversight of Boeing, said it expected Boeing to submit the proposed fix \"over the coming weeks\" after it undertakes additional work.\nAfter that, the proposal will be submitted to a \"rigorous safety review,\" the FAA spokesman said.\nPRELIMINARY REPORT THIS WEEK\nEarlier on Monday, Ethiopian foreign ministry spokesman Nebiat Getachew said the transport ministry would release \"a preliminary report into its investigation\" of the Mar 10 accident in which a Nairobi-bound Boeing 737 MAX crashed shortly after taking off from Addis Ababa.\nThe Ethiopian government gave no details on the exact timing of the release, nor hints about the report's findings.\nNebiat initially said the report would be released on Monday but the transport ministry, which is in charge of investigations, later said it would still be some days.\n\"The report will most likely be released some day later this week,\" ministry spokesman Mussie Yiheyes said.\nIt was not clear on Monday if the transport ministry's preliminary report would be made public straight away, or limited to the eyes of authorities including the FAA.\nThe plane's black boxes are being examined by France's BEA air safety agency, working with American and Ethiopian investigators to determine what went wrong.\nANTI-STALL SYSTEM\nA source with knowledge of the investigation has said an anti-stalling system, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), was activated shortly before the crash.\nBoeing designed the automated MCAS system - which lowers the aircraft's nose if it detects a stall or loss of airspeed - for this particular model.\nThe same system was implicated in the October crash, with initial investigations finding that a sensor on the plane had transmitted incorrect information to the MCAS system.\nThe pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 struggled to control the aircraft as the MCAS repeatedly pushed the plane's nose down, according to the flight data recorder.\nThe pilot had tried repeatedly to regain control and pull the nose up but the plane crashed into the sea.\nBoth the planes in Indonesia and Ethiopia reportedly experienced erratic steep climbs and descents, as well as fluctuating airspeeds, before crashing shortly after takeoff.\nEthiopia has already said there were \"clear similarities\" between the two MAX 8 crashes.\nEthiopian Airlines is Africa's largest carrier and in many ways the international face of the nation.

UnitedHealth Group Inc, Humana Inc, CVS Health Corp, through its acquisition of Aetna, and WellCare Health Plans Inc are the largest sellers of Medicare Advantage health insurance.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Under the program, they are paid a set rate by the government to cover member healthcare costs.\nIn addition to medical costs, the government's 2020 payment rate also factors in other changes in policies, such as quality of care related payments that may result in declines or increases from year to year.\nFor instance, the 2020 rate reflected a decline in payments of 3.08 percent related to the Affordable Care Act requirement that Medicare Advantage and fee-for-service Medicare have the same payment structure.\nStarting in 2020, Medicare Advantage plans will also be able to offer supplemental non-health related benefits to chronically ill enrollees that address their social needs, CMS Administrator Seema Verma said. Those can include needed structural changes to the home, such as adding ramps and widening doorways.\nThe plans can tailor these offerings to individuals, and the offerings could increase competition between plans, Verma said.\nPreviously, plans have only been allowed to offer health related benefits.\nMedicare Advantage competes with the traditional Medicare fee-for-service program. Both have grown as the \"Baby Boomer\" generation ages into Medicare. Together, they cover more than 55 million people.\n(Reporting by Caroline Humer; Editing by Bill Berkrot)\nSource: Reuters", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "medicare", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "medicare advantage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centers for medicare & medicaid services", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bordeaux", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T01:10:22.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "25441f3107522ca7a4f4bcee8de55e30dd08b862", "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/stocks-close-sharply-higher-on-strong-us-and-china-data/ar-BBVttPz", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "Breaking News Stories from US and Around the World | MSN News", "title": "Stocks close sharply higher on strong US and China data", "title_full": "Stocks close sharply higher on strong US and China data", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "25441f3107522ca7a4f4bcee8de55e30dd08b862", "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/stocks-close-sharply-higher-on-strong-us-and-china-data/ar-BBVttPz", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Fred Imbert", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Stocks close sharply higher on strong US and China data", "text": "Stocks close sharply higher on strong US and China data CNBC 2 hrs ago Fred Imbert Post-Market Wrap: April 01, 2019 CNBC Post-Market Wrap: April 01, 2019 CNBC 1:32 Woman accusing Biden of inappropriate kiss Jeff\nStocks jumped Monday as strong manufacturing data out of the U.S. and China eased worries of a possible global economic slowdown.\nThe Dow jumped 329 points, closing above 26,000 for the first time since Feb. 26 on sstrength in United Technologies, Caterpillar and J.P. Morgan Chase.\nThe S&P 500 climbed 1.1 percent as the financials sector outperformed. The Nasdaq ended 1.3 percent higher on gains from Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet.\n\"The momentum is still positive and we're constantly drifting higher,\" said Michael Katz, a partner at Seven Points Securities. \"Barring any bad news, that's going to be the case until we do get some sort of bigger piece of macro news.\"\nBank stocks rose broadly. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase all closed at least 2.5 percent higher. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) jumped 2.8 percent as yield rose.\nU.S. manufacturing activity expanded last month, rebounding from its lowest level since late 2016, according to data from the Institute for Supply Management. The Dow and S&P 500 jumped to their highs of the day on the data.\nIn China, the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index jumped to 50.8 in March \u2014 its highest level in eight months \u2014 after economists polled by Refinitiv expected a print of 49.9. A number above 50 indicates expansion; a number below 50 shows contraction.\n\"But these positive developments mentioned above do not mean all risks have been resolved. A US-China trade deal has not yet been finalized and could still falter,\" said Adrian Zuercher, the head of APAC asset allocation at UBS Global Wealth Management's Chief Investment Office. \"China's government stimulus, while supportive, won't be of the magnitude of 2009 or 2015. The China earnings downgrade cycle, while slowing, is not yet complete.\"\nAsian equities rose broadly on the data, with the Shanghai Composite surging 2.6 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi indexes both rose more than 1 percent overnight. European stocks also climbed. The Stoxx 600 index closed 1.2 percent higher.\nThe figures gave some much-needed relief to investors unnerved of late by fears of a global economic downturn. Early last week, equities came under pressure as bond markets indicated an impending U.S. recession.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note recently dipped below that of the 3-month bill, in what's known as a yield curve inversion. A yield curve inversion is seen as a trusted predictor of a recession. The spread between widened on Monday, as the 10-year rose to 2.49 percent.\n\"The cycle is extended, and the inverted curve has made us even more alert for trouble in the economy and financial markets, but we do not think trouble is imminent,\" Doug Peta, chief U.S. investment strategist at BCA Research, said in a note. \"We are not dismissing the inverted yield curve, but our other recession-indicator inputs are not confirming its warning. Given the Fed's new guidance, we expect that the next recession will not arrive before mid-to-late 2020.\"\nMonday's gains came after the S&P 500 notched last week its best start to a year since 1998 and its strongest quarterly performance since 2009. The broad index gained 13.1 percent in the first quarter, led by the technology sector.\nIn other news boosting markets, the U.S. and China recently concluded their latest round of trade talks. U.S. officials last week said China had made proposals on a number of issues \u2014 including forced technology transfers \u2014 that go further than previous commitments.\nThe two superpowers are set to resume talks in Washington this week. Both countries have targeted billions of dollars' worth of each other's goods with tariffs in their protracted trade dispute.\nAmazon rose more than 1.5 percent after analyst at Oppenheimer hiked his price target on the stock to $2,085 from $1,975, citing AI and cloud adoption.\nCNBC's Ryan Browne contributed to this report.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fBBVvafJ%3focid%3dst&text=Post-Market+Wrap%3a+April+01%2c+2019&original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fBBVvafJ%3focid%3dst", "http://cnbc.com/", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBVvafJ?blobrefkey=closedcaptionen-us&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;culture&quot;:&quot;en-us&quot;}", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fBBVvafJ%3focid%3dsl&title=Post-Market+Wrap%3a+April+01%2c+2019&source=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fBBVvafJ%3focid%3dsl", "http://wus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/aa23e7e0-33e8-4cd0-bd71-079b45183737/ad0e0da5-6af0-436e-89df-5acc8c5e.ism/manifest(format=mpd-time-csf)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;101&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://wus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/aa23e7e0-33e8-4cd0-bd71-079b45183737/ad0e0da5-6af0-436e-89df-5acc8c5e_650.mp4&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;}", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBVvhyh.img&quot;},&quot;headlineImage&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBVvhyh.img&quot;}}", "http://video.cnbc.com/gallery?video=7000072834&__source=msn%7Cmoney%7Cheadline%7Cheadline%7Cvideo%7C&par=msn&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;CNBC&quot;,&quot;sourceLogo&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Post-Market", "https://2df7e.v.fwmrm.net&quot;,&quot;HybridPlayerAdInitTimeout&quot;:", "https://plus.cnbc.com/videoservice/rssvideosearch.do?partnerId=8020&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;displayAds&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fBBVvafJ%3focid%3dsw", "http://wus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/3649c86f-7b6b-41a0-a667-9fe6b7a9a0e3/ad0e0da5-6af0-436e-89df-5acc8c5ee64b.mp4&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1004&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://wus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/aa23e7e0-33e8-4cd0-bd71-079b45183737/ad0e0da5-6af0-436e-89df-5acc8c5e.ism/manifest&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1006&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://wus-streami"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fred imbert", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jeff stocks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "biden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael katz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "netflix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "citigroup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seven points securities", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united technologies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caterpillar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spdr s&p bank etf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morgan stanley, bank of america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j.p. morgan chase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T01:11:26.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "345eecefff56c3c26bd91f083eeeec03ba17bdff", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/news/3447562-pimco-declares-monthly-distributions", "site_full": "seekingalpha.com", "site": "seekingalpha.com", "site_section": "http://seekingalpha.com/market_currents.xml", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "mutual_funds"], "section_title": "Breaking News on Seeking Alpha", "title": "PIMCO declares monthly distributions -

Jury selection begins for US trial of Justine Damond Ruszczyk's shooter 0:00 Share on Twitter Share on Facebook A jury is being selected in the murder trial of a former Minneapolis police officer over the shooting death of Australian woman Justine Damond Ruszczyk in 2017. Updated Share on Facebook Share on Twitter\nJury selection has begun in the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer who fatally shot an unarmed Australian woman after she called 911 to report a possible sexual assault behind her home.\nMohamed Noor, 33, is charged in the July 2017 death of Justine Damond Ruszczyk in a case that drew international attention, cost the police chief her job and forced major revisions to the Police Department's policy on body cameras.\nProsecutors charged Noor with second-degree intentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, saying there is no evidence Noor faced a threat that justified deadly force. Mohamed Noor leaves the Hennepin County Government Centre. AAP\nThey must prove he acted unreasonably when he shot Ms Damond Ruszczyk, a 40-year-old life coach with both US and Australian citizenship who was engaged to be married.\nNoor's lawyers plan to argue that he used reasonable force and acted in self-defence.\nNoor has refused to talk to investigators and his lawyers haven't said whether he will testify at his trial, which could last weeks.\nHe did not respond to reporters' questions Monday as he and his lawyers arrived at the Hennepin County courthouse for the start of jury selection.\nPotential jurors were expected to fill out forms in a half-day session. Justine Damond died in 2017 after being shot near her house. AAP\nNoor's partner that night, Officer Matthew Harrity, told investigators he was driving a police SUV when he heard a voice and a thump and caught a glimpse of someone outside his window.\nHarrity said he was startled and thought his life was in danger. READ MORE US cop pleads not guilty in Justine Damond's death\nHe said he then heard a noise and turned to see that Noor, in the passenger seat, had fired his gun past Harrity and hit Ms Damond Ruszczyk through the driver's side window.\nThe officers did not turn on their body cameras until after the shooting, and there was no squad car video.\nThe lack of video was widely criticised, and Ms Damond Ruszczyk's family called for changes, including when officers are required to turn on their cameras. Family and friends lay flowers during a candlelight vigil for Justine Damond in Sydney. AAP\nDays later, the Police Department strengthened its policy to require that the cameras be activated immediately when responding to a call or making a traffic stop.\nThe shooting also raised questions about the training of Noor, a Somali American whose arrival on the force about two years earlier had been celebrated by city leaders and Minnesota's large Somali community. Noor had previously worked in property management. The transcript of the start of a 911 call made by Justine Damond. SBS News\nDocuments later filed as part of the criminal case showed that training officers voiced concerns about Noor's fitness for duty long before he shot Ms Damond Ruszczyk, but he was deemed fit to serve.\nJudge Kathryn Quaintance ruled that prosecutors cannot present evidence about prior \"bad acts\" as a police officer.\nShe also said Noor's pre-employment psychological exam, which found that Noor was more likely than other officers to be impatient or have difficulty confronting people, cannot be used unless he testifies and it becomes relevant.\nShe also ruled his refusal to speak to investigators can't be used as evidence unless Noor takes the stand.

Nathaniel D Rowland, 25, was arrested over the weekend in connection with the death of Samantha Josephson, who was reported missing on Friday afternoon after she failed to return home after a night out with friends. Josephson\u2019s body was discovered in a wooded area about 100 kilometres from Columbia where she was last seen by two hunters on Friday afternoon. Camera Icon Samantha Josephson shortly before she got into a car (right) she thought was her Uber. Picture: Supplied \u201cI implore the court to deny bail or the posting of a bond. He should never be given the right to walk free again for what he did to my daughter, or given the opportunity to hurt anyone else,\u201d Marci Josephson told a judge at a court hearing. Rowland, who faces charges of kidnapping and murder, waived his right to appear in court. CCTV from the morning that Josephson went missing showed her getting into the back seat of a black Chevrolet Impala driven by Rowland around 2am (5pm AEDT) on Friday. Investigators said the 21-year-old had ordered an Uber and they believe she thought Rowland\u2019s car was her ride. Authorities have not made public how Josephson died. Camera Icon Suspect Nathaniel Rowland has been charged with murder. Picture: AFP \u201cThere are no words to describe the immense pain his actions have caused our family and friends,\u201d Marci Josephson said. \u201cHe\u2019s taken away a piece of our heart, soul and life. Shame on him. We thought we would be here to see his evil face. I cannot fathom how someone could randomly select a person, a beautiful girl, and steal her life away. His actions were senseless, vile and unacceptable.\u201d Rowland was taken into custody on Saturday after police recognised his car from the CCTV footage and conducted a traffic stop. Rowland tried to flee on foot but was caught by police. Police Chief William H. Holbrook said Josephson\u2019s mobile phone was found in Rowland\u2019s car as well as a bottle of bleach, germicidal wipes and a \u201clarge amount\u201d of blood that was later matched to the student.

(AP Photo/Matt Dunham, File) By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer NEW YORK \u2014 Apr 1, 2019 9:49 PM facebook twitter mail\nYears before Tottenham Hotspur Stadium started rising like a spaceship in north London, planning on how to finance the structure was underway nearly 3,500 miles away.\nIn a glass tower near the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan, Greg Carey and his team at Goldman Sachs worked with Tottenham to finance $828 million (637 million pounds) of the project, which is expected to cost well over $1 billion. Club owners hope it will pay for itself and produce enough cash to help Spurs buy superstars so the club can compete at the top level of European soccer . That means more than selling the 62,062 seats for English Premier League matches.\nClub officials and the banks backing them say millions more will come in from hospitality, broadcast, sponsorship, merchandising, concessions, advertising and digital rights \u2014 the types of revenue that bankrolled America's stadium boom over the past decade.\nEven at soccer's highest level, you must spend money to make money.\n\"Before starting the financing we had discussed project finance with Greg and walked through a number of models and ways to securitize revenues and best approaches,\" said Matthew Collecott, Tottenham's operations and finance director. \"Was useful to understand what the market was doing in terms of available methods of finance, stripping out revenue streams to securitize, mix of offerings and modeling.\"\nGoldman has worked to finance more than three dozen sports projects, and Tottenham's is among the most prominent. The stadium opens Wednesday with a Premier League match against Crystal Palace. The opening was postponed seven times, a delay of nearly eight months that caused 14 of this season's 19 league home matches to be moved to Wembley, the home of England's national team,\nSpurs played from 1899 through May 2017 at White Hart Lane, which had a capacity of 36,310 before a corner was torn down ahead of its final season to allow work to start. The new stadium's 120,000-square meter (143,000-square yard) footprint is four times the size of the old. Features include a single-bank 17,500-seat south stand, Britain's largest, which sits above a plaque marking the center circle of the old field. The stadium is topped by the club's symbol, a 15-foot (4.6 meter) Golden Cockerel , twice the height of the original.\nTottenham is in the relatively poor Borough of Haringey, the site of rioting in 2011. The stadium is part of a redevelopment project that includes 222 homes designed as affordable housing and a new school.\nWhite Hart Lane had claustrophobic corridors, cramped seats and concession choices limited mostly to fish and chips, beer and water. The new stadium, designed by Populous, usually will open two hours before kickoff (three hours for luxury seating) and is the first in British soccer with the myriad of food offerings common in U.S. venues, 60 food and drink outlets, all with cashless payments, that include a Beavertown microbrewery. Spurs established several new \"largests\" for a European stadium: a 65-meter (71-yard) bar along the goal line, two of the four video boards and a 23,000-square foot retail store.\nTottenham has a deal to host two NFL games each season, and the grass field on 99 steel trays retracts below the south stand on 2,090 rails to reveal artificial turf underneath.\n\"It's this escalation for Champions League,\" said Carey, a Goldman managing director. \"It all comes down to how much money you have to buy, and these stadiums are going to not only pay for the investment in that stadium but produce excess cash flow which is going to go back into buying players.\"\nTottenham reached a 200 million pound financing agreement in December 2015 with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and HSBC, replaced it in May 2017 for 400 million pounds and said last October the amount had increased to 637 million pounds (currently $828 million) with an April 2022 expiration. Spurs, plans to convert the debt into notes with a mix of maturities.\nSpurs have not signed any transfers this season, but club executive chairman Daniel Levy told the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust on March 12 \"the net spend on players would not be affected\" by stadium costs.\nTottenham hasn't won the English title since 1961 but finished among the top three in each of the last three seasons. The team is fourth this year, and plays Manchester City in the Champions League quarterfinals next week.\nArsenal moved in the 2006-07 season from 38,419-seat Highbury to 60,260-seat Emirates Stadium, but the new venue has not translated into a league or European championship.\n\"An old stadium with limited facilities built over decades had to be replaced with what we have delivered to ensure the long-term growth of the club and for future generations of fans,\" Collecott said.\nSpurs felt the new venue \u2014 a naming-rights agreement has not yet been reached \u2014 was key to future success. But they have kept the fans close to the field, unlike at some of the newer stadiums. The distance between the stands and the touchline is 4.9 meters (5\u00bd yards) behind the goals, down from 13.5 meters (14\u00be yards) at Emirates and 18 meters (19\u00bd yards) at Olympic Stadium, where West Ham moved for the 2016-17 season.\nGoldman's projects include new Yankee Stadium, the Brooklyn Nets' Barclays Center, MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, the Minnesota Twins' Target Field, the Minnesota Vikings' U.S. Bank Stadium, the Orlando Magic's Amway Center, Los Angeles Football Club's Banc of California Stadium and D.C. United's Audi Field.\nCarey's group is working on contemplated stadiums for Roma, Inter Milan and the Dutch club Feyenoord. He advises the Oakland Athletics and Tampa Bay Rays, the two Major League Baseball teams most in need of new stadiums.\n\"They know how to be creative using you know different resources available,\" said Melanie Lenz, the Rays' chief development officer. \"A trusted adviser to help us understand what options could be available within the Tampa Bay market.\"\nCarey views the structure as similar to financing a road or a port.\n\"There's three risks you have: construction risk, completion risk and revenue risk,\" he said. \"What we help the clubs do is eliminate those first two, how we can make sure we're going to get this thing built on time and at cost, and then we invest, we give them money or we get investors for that revenue risk. And if you take a look at the revenue projections of new stadiums or renovated stadiums, you don't miss by much.\"\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP\u2014Sports bubble_chat", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AP\u2014Sports", "https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dunham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronald blum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg carey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tottenham hotspur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tottenham hotspur stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tottenham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tottenham stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T01:15:19.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2ef37a55f2701aca14148ea33118cc7c746809e8", "url": "http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/airline-system-outage-sparks-flight-chaos-across-the-us-after-computer-crash/news-story/5875f4a8d425f926abb06e6af9d2a3ad", "site_full": "www.news.com.au", "site": "news.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.perthnow.com.au/rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "PerthNow", "title": "Airline \u2018system outage\u2019 sparks flight chaos across the US after computer crash", "title_full": "Airline \u2018system outage\u2019 sparks flight chaos across the US after computer crash", "published": "2019-04-01T15:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/5875F4A8D425F926ABB06E6AF9D2A3AD/1554129624236_93771f29c9620867a5e0fe5beeee3b10.jpeg?imwidth=1024", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1340, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2ef37a55f2701aca14148ea33118cc7c746809e8", "url": "http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/airline-system-outage-sparks-flight-chaos-across-the-us-after-computer-crash/news-story/5875f4a8d425f926abb06e6af9d2a3ad", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The Sun", "published": "2019-04-01T15:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Airline \u2018system outage\u2019 sparks flight chaos across the US after computer crash", "text": "Airline \u2018system outage\u2019 sparks flight chaos across the US after computer crash The Sun News Corp Australia Network April 1, 2019 8:30PM At least three major US airlines were grounded today after computer systems crashed. Delta, United and Southwest Airlines said the \"system-wide outage\" was affecting all flights across the country. American Airlines and JetBlue were also affected as passengers said they were stopped at the gate or were left sitting on stationary planes for up to two hours. Camera Icon Many carriers across the country have been impacted by huge delays. Picture: AFP Airlines were hit by problems with the Aerodata planning software, which calculates weight and balance on planes, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, The Sun reported. Southwestern Airlines told a passenger who tweeted about delays in Nashville: \"We're working through some Tech related issues and will have you on your way as quickly as possible. \"It's affecting our flights system wide, and we're working to see if it's affecting any other carriers this morning as well.\" Loading content... \"We do not have a specific time as yet.\" Katie Shehan, trying to get from Knoxville to Chicago, tweeted to United: \"Your system is down apparently \u2014 no one can leave without paperwork. Pl ase fix.\" United replied: \"It appears that we are experiencing an outage that is impacting our ability to create release paperwork. \"We know this is frustrating, and we will get you in the air as quickly as possible.\" Passengers said there was also chaos at Atlanta and Boston airports among many others. Lauren Luna, stranded at Orlando in Florida, said: \"Our gate just told us it\u2019s an FAA outage affecting all airlines.\" The FAA tweeted: \"Several U.S. #airlines are experiencing computer issues this morning. \"Please contact your airline directly for flight information and updates. The #FAA does not cancel flights.\" American Airlines said the problem was \"affecting a few of our regional carriers nationwide\". Canada's Alaska Air Group also said it was experiencing a system-wide outage. It is understood the airlines bought the software from the same developer.

The Wonder Woman EP features three songs, including its title track, and Birge tells iHeartRadio of the idea behind the song, \"Cody and I have been working on new music for a little bit over a year and a half. When we went in to write this project, the biggest thing we wanted to do was A, be a part of writing and producing the whole thing, have it be our sound and kind of plant our flag in the ground and say, 'Hello world, this is Waterloo Revival.' And B, we wanted it to just portray a positive energy, make people wanna roll their windows down, enjoy their day, and just be a mood saver. So, we came up with this idea, 'Wonder Woman' as a song title. But the coolest thing about country music is it's notorious for a twist or a hook that you didn't see coming. And that's what we kinda landed on with this song. It's not, 'Wonder Woman,' you're so amazing, you can do it all. But it's 'Wonder Woman,' like, I wonder how you could possibly be here alone. I wonder who would ever break up with you, and I wonder if you wanna get to know me a little better.\"\nCooper adds, \"It's so much fun live and the response we've gotten from radio, too, has been amazing. But it's just one of those ones, regardless of what kind of day I'm having, if it's been a rough day on the road and we've been up for 20-something hours, we start playing that song and I mean, I wrote this song and I'm still up there dancing, and it's just fun to see everyone else do the same.\"\nAnother song from the EP, \"Back To You,\" is inspired by their native Austin. George explains, \"We grew up in Austin, Texas, and that city had a huge influence on us growing up. It was really special to us, the people, the culture, the music, especially. And so when we sat down to write this project, we wanted to give a nod to our hometown. So that one's really special 'cause it has a lot of little shout-outs to Magnolia Caf\u00e9 and Bull Creek and stuff that you would only know if you're from Austin. But if you're not from Austin, you kinda replace it with the places you used to hang out when you grew up.\"\nAs we got to know George and Cody better, we also played a game of Me vs. Drunk Me where they talked about late-night pizza, karaoke, making friends with strangers, and so much more. Read on below. When you order late-night pizza:\nGeorge: \"When I eat pizza past midnight, it's definitely drunk me, and that's a little bit of a problem because if I order it, that's fine. But if I'm making it myself, there's a chance that I'm gonna pass out before I turn the oven off. And so there's been multiple occasions where I've woken up to a smoky house and a black pizza. So just be careful with your midnight cravings. It's a public service announcement. Make sure you can stay up to finish your pizza.\"\nCody: \"And you can tell I'm drunk ordering pizza when I ask for a vat of the largest amount of ranch dressing you could possibly get. Because it's great with pizza.\" When you text the wrong person:\nGeorge: \"I would say when I end up texting the wrong person, it's both drunk me and sober me. We're pretty scatterbrained these days. It's hard for us to even remember what city we're in most of the time. So, if somebody has a similar first name or last name, we've got fat fingers, we're doing 9,000 things at once. So, I've definitely texted the person that I was talking about when I was trying to send somebody else about them. And luckily, we're pretty nice guys. So we're not saying anything incriminating. But yeah, we definitely have to be careful about that.\"\nCody: \"The key is just to play it off like it was intentional.\" When you hit the mic at karaoke:\nCody: \"The only time you'll catch me singing karaoke is gonna be drunk me.\"\nGeorge: \"So, you know how Bruce Wayne and Batman have alter egos? So by day, Cody is half of the duo Waterloo Revival. But by night, Cody is a solo artist: Karaoke King Cody Cooper. So. That ticket's a little harder to get, but if you can find it in your city, you definitely wanna get footage of that.\" When you make plans, and then completely forget that you made plans:\nGeorge: \"I would say drunk me and sober me. I would say, really, I try not to forget plans, I try not to leave people hanging. But, the best thing is when there's something, some plans that you've made that you didn't really wanna follow through on, and then the other person cancels, and so you're not the jerk and you don't have to go. And then that leads to drunk me, because I get to stay home and drink a bottle of wine and whiskey.\"\nCody: \"I would say if I forget plans, honestly, it's more than likely sober me, because I have this weird tack that I have that when I'm drunk, I like, instill it in my memory if I make any plans. And so I always wake up in the morning remembering everything I planned out.\"\nGeorge: \"You're, like, the only person in the world who does that, but it's amazing. It saves the both of us.\"\nCody: \"Yeah, but when I'm sober, it's in one ear and out the other.\" When you you find random money in your pocket:\nGeorge: \"Well it's usually sober you that finds the money and drunk you that leaves the money the night before. But I would say that it's kinda like winning a scratch-off or something. When you reach in your pocket and find $20, it's like free money. You don't need to worry about saving that, you spend that money because it was a gift from drunk you. Right?\" When you make friends with complete strangers:\nCody: \"That's true. I'd say both, but more drunk me would be the one that would make friends with complete strangers. I'm notorious for getting drunk and just telling everybody that I love them.\"\nGeorge: \"I give Cody the hardest time on this. We were at St. Jude the other day and we had gone out in Memphis that night. And that night, everybody goes and sings karaoke and has beers and just has a great celebration. And, Cody had met somebody and they talked for, at max 45 seconds. And this was the first time he had ever met that person. And they were walking away and he was like, 'I love you, man.'\" When you find yourself creeping on someone's social media:\nCody: \"I'd say for me, creeping on social media would probably be more of a sober me thing than a drunk me thing. Because drunk me is usually a little more in the moment, whereas sober be is just, I don't know ...\"\nGeorge: \"I would say I try to ban drunk me from social media. Because, drunk me has a tendency of maybe going through somebody's Instagram and liking a picture that's 52 weeks old. So where it's very obvious that you're stalking somebody's Instagram. So, drunk me is not allowed on social media.\" When you're buying rounds of drinks for everyone:\nCody: \"When I find myself buying rounds of drinks for everybody, it's definitely drunk me.\"\nGeorge: \"Yeah, and we all appreciate that when you do, man. It's really nice.\"\nCody: \"Yeah so if you ever want free drinks, come out with me.\"\nGeorge: \"Yeah definitely. You have all these grand intentions of saving money and what you're gonna do with it, saving up for vacations. And then you get, like, three shots in you and you're like, 'You know what? You know what everybody in this bar needs right now? A beer and a shot. And I'm gonna be the one to buy it.' And then you wake up and you check your bank account the next morning and you're like, 'Damn it, drunk me. You did it again.'\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nicole mastrogiannis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cody cooper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cody", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george birge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "birge", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "waterloo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T01:17:01.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b3edefeb0da5be6c429dad57cd2d090c30b4a8c0", "url": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2001319069/kenya-hosts-us-pension-funds-meet", "site_full": "www.standardmedia.co.ke", "site": "standardmedia.co.ke", "site_section": "http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/rss/business.php", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Popular Standard Digital News Feeds", "title": "Kenya hosts US pension funds meet", "title_full": "Kenya hosts US pension funds meet", "published": "2019-04-01T22:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "KE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/images/monday/thumb_kenya_hosts_us_pensi5ca23732943ad.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1717, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b3edefeb0da5be6c429dad57cd2d090c30b4a8c0", "url": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2001319069/kenya-hosts-us-pension-funds-meet", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Frankline Sunday", "published": "2019-04-01T22:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kenya hosts US pension funds meet", "text": "Kenya hosts US pension funds meet Frankline Sunday 01st Apr 2019 19:06:04 GMT +0300 The Kenya Pension Fund Investment Consortium (KEPFIC) is hosting 30 representatives of major US pension and asset management funds seeking investment opportunities in the country. The three-day event that kicked off yesterday brings together the consortium --Mobilising Institutional Investors to Develop Africa\u2019s Infrastructure (MiDA), a partnership between the US National Association of Securities Professionals (NASP) and the US Agency for International Development (USAid). Collectively, these funds manage assets worth Sh100 trillion.

We are looking forward to advancing our discussions with our Kenyan counterparts at KEPFIC for mutual support and benefit\u201d. Over two years, MiDA members have closed on new deals close to Sh80 billion, focusing in Africa and other emerging markets. Local fund managers are optimistic about receiving new financing for large infrastructure projects. The World Bank is facilitating the forum.

(NYSE:REZI)", "text": "Quick Take Resideo Technologies ( REZI ) announced it has acquired Buoy Labs for an undisclosed amount.\nBuoy Labs operates as a smart home Internet of Things [IoT] company with a focus on household water usage and response.\nREZI's deal for Buoy provides it with a natural addition to its existing product lines and can be sold through existing channels; the deal makes excellent strategic sense.\nTarget Company Santa Cruz, California-based Buoy Labs was founded in 2015 to develop Buoy, an IoT device that tracks household water usage and delivers real-time data through a subscription-based app.\nManagement was headed by CEO and Co-Founder Keri Waters , who was previously CEO at Vivo Technology.\nBelow is an overview video of what Buoy is all about:\nSource: YouTube\nCompany partners or major customers include:\nDelta Faucet Company Elemental Excelerator Source: Buoy\nInvestors have invested $60K in the company and include Elemental Excelerator and Highway1. Source: Crunchbase\nMarket & Competition According to a market research report by Zion Market Research, the global consumer IoT market was valued at $46.6 billion in 2018 and is projected to reach $143.5 billion by 2025.\nThis represents a very strong CAGR of 17.4% between 2019 and 2025.\nThe main driver for this expected growth is the increase in the number of IoT-based consumer applications, including smart homes, security systems, wearable tech, and personal assistants.\nThe Asia-Pacific region is projected to grow at the fastest rate due to rapid urbanization and industrialization in developing countries such as China and India.\nMajor vendors that provide smart home IoT water meters include:\nFlo Technologies FLUID Labs SmarterHomes Technologies StreamLabs Source: Sentieo\nAcquisition Terms and Rationale Resideo did not disclose the acquisition price or terms and didn't file a Form 8-K or provide a change in financial guidance, so the deal was likely for a financially non-material amount.\nA review of the firm's most recent 10-K filing indicates that as of December 31, 2018, REZI had $265 million in cash and equivalents and $3.4 billion in total liabilities, of which, long-term debt represented $1.2 billion.\nFree cash flow during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, was $398 million.\nIn the past 6 months, REZI's stock price has dropped 38.7% vs. competitor ADT's ( ADT ) drop of 25.6%, as the chart below indicates:\nSource: Sentieo\nIn the roughly six months since its public debut, REZI has produced uneven earnings results vs. expectations:\nSource: Seeking Alpha\nAnalyst ratings are uniformly in a 'Buy' status and the current consensus price target of $26.75 implies a potential upside of 34% from its current stock price of $19.92 at press time:\nSource: Seeking Alpha\nAnalyst sentiment in the most recent earnings call has dropped markedly from the previous call:\nSource: Sentieo\nCommentary REZI has acquired Buoy to expand its service offerings into the home water tracking business.\nAs Mike Nefkens, Resideo CEO stated in the deal announcement:\nBuoy Labs is the first move in our ongoing strategic initiative to identify and execute on tuck-in acquisitions. Their products and talent are a natural fit for Resideo's portfolio of professionally installed and monitored smart home solutions that integrate the critical systems of the home.\nWith this first acquisition as a standalone company after spinning out from Honeywell ( HON ), REZI hopes to expand its addressable market and increase its 'share of wallet.'\nFrom a strategic perspective, the deal makes perfect sense. It can be sold through REZI's existing channels and it reduces the number of vendors that consumers need to coordinate with to track their home energy and resource usage.\nThe Buoy system also provides for a subscription revenue model, which results in lower upfront costs for consumers and a more predictable revenue stream for REZI.\nI expect to see further 'tuck-in' acquisitions from REZI related to home management products and services.\nAlthough REZI's stock has performed poorly since its spin-out, acquisitions like these make complete sense and are a signal of management's clear thinking about how to expand business opportunities in the most efficient manner.\nI research IPOs and technology M&A deals.\nMembers of my proprietary research service IPO Edge get the latest IPO research, news, market trends, and industry analysis.

This is the second-greatest number of cases reported in the United States since measles was declared eliminated in 2000. The highest number of reported cases since elimination was 667 in 2014.\nMeasles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus that can spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or if a person comes into direct contact or shares germs by touching the same objects or surfaces.\nThe states reporting cases are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Texas and Washington.\nThe CDC says six outbreaks \u2014 defined as three or more cases \u2014 are ongoing in California (Santa Cruz and Butte County), New Jersey, New York (Rockland County and New York City) and Washington.\nThese outbreaks are linked to travelers who brought measles back from other countries such as Israel, Ukraine and the Philippines, where large measles outbreaks are occurring.\nTypical measles symptoms, including high fever, rash all over the body, stuffy nose and reddened eyes, usually disappear without treatment within two or three weeks, though a severe case of the measles can lead to death.\nLast week, in an effort to contain an outbreak of measles that began in October, Rockland County, New York, banned unvaccinated people under age 18 from public places. As of Friday, the county reported 153 confirmed cases, though state health officials noted that additional cases have not been reported.\nLast year, the CDC reported 372 total cases and 17 outbreaks, with three areas \u2014 New York, New York City, and New Jersey \u2014 contributing most of the cases. All three area outbreaks were linked to travelers bringing measles back from Israel and then spreading the virus among unvaccinated people in Orthodox Jewish communities.\nA total of 82 people brought measles into the nation from other countries in 2018. This is the greatest number of imported cases since measles was declared eliminated in the United States.\nSince 1963, when the vaccine was introduced, cases and deaths from measles in the United States and other developed countries have plummeted. Prior to the vaccine, measles caused approximately 450 to 500 deaths each year in the United States.\nThe measles vaccine \u2014 known as the MMR vaccine \u2014 is very effective. One dose is about 93% effective at preventing measles if you come in contact with the virus. Two doses are about 97% effective. Experts recommend that children receive the vaccine in two doses: first, between ages 12 months and 15 months and a second between 4 and 6 years old.\nWith any medicine, including vaccines, there is a chance of reactions, according to the CDC. These are usually mild and go away on their own, but there is a \u201cremote chance\u201d of the vaccine causing side effects and even serious injuries.\nThe-CNN-Wire", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeff glor us measl", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cbs13 news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cbs", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cbs evening news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sacramento", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kentucky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new jersey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "illinois", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new hampshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T01:25:06.068+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8ac434e6db70ee46a98d8a3863e1b837a391f708", "url": "https://www.freelancer.com/projects/php/website-adjustments-19111481/", "site_full": "www.freelancer.com", "site": "freelancer.com", "site_section": "http://www.freelancer.com/rss/affiliatejob_searching1_NET.xml", "site_categories": ["job_search", "hobbies_and_interests", "jobs", "freelance_writing"], "section_title": "Freelancer - New Projects", "title": "website adjustments [US freelancers only]", "title_full": "website adjustments [US freelancers only]", "published": "2019-04-02T01:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.f-cdn.com/assets/img/facebook/default-04d56222.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1547, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8ac434e6db70ee46a98d8a3863e1b837a391f708", "url": "https://www.freelancer.com/projects/php/website-adjustments-19111481/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T01:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "website adjustments [US freelancers only]", "text": "HTML website adjustments [US freelancers only]\nI need someone who is an expert in Laravel, React, and Headless Wordpress.

There were 372 last year.\nThe numbers are preliminary, and may change. But the 2019 tally is already the most since 2014, when 667 were reported.\nThis year's numbers have been driven by outbreaks in several states, including New York, California, Illinois, Texas, and Washington.\nMost people who get measles have not been vaccinated. In the U.S., most outbreaks are sparked by travelers who picked up the virus in countries where measles is more common. Nearly 83,000 people contracted measles in Europe in 2018, the highest number in a decade, according to the World Health Organization.\nThe measles vaccine is 97% effective, according to the CDC.\nMeasles is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and it is extremely contagious.\nFor most people, measles is miserable but not life-threatening. The most common symptoms include fever, runny nose, cough, and a rash all over the body. However, a very small fraction of people get much sicker, and can suffer complications like pneumonia and swelling of the brain. Also, measles can cause pregnant women to deliver prematurely.\nThere have been three measles-related deaths reported in the U.S. since 2000, including two in 2003 and one in 2015.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Cresco stated that it will be the biggest acquisition of a public U.S. cannabis company ever. With such a major deal, you might think that Origin House shareholders would be on cloud nine. However, that wasn't the case. Origin House shares dropped 5% in early trading on Monday. Why wasn't there more excitement over the acquisition? Here are three things you need to know about this transaction that promises to shake up the U.S. cannabis industry. Continue Reading Below 1. Terms of less-than-endearment Probably the main reason Origin House shareholders weren't overly enthusiastic about the acquisition is the price tag. The deal values Origin House shares at 12.68 in Canadian dollars, or around $9.50. That's only a 5% premium over Origin House's closing price on Friday, March 29, 2019. Origin House shareholders won't get any cash, either. Cresco Labs plans to acquire all outstanding shares of Origin House, with each Origin House shareholder receiving 0.8428 shares of Cresco Labs for each Origin House share owned. Cresco Labs has been a solid winner, jumping 35% in 2018 and up 68% so far this year. But Origin House has been even hotter, soaring 59% last year and 85% year to date in 2019. It was even the No. 2 best-performing marijuana stock on the market in March . Some Origin House investors might think that they're getting ownership in a Corvette when they owned a stake in a Ferrari. 2. The case for why the deal makes sense Advertisement Size matters. If you're looking for the main reason why a combination of Cresco Labs and Origin House makes sense, that's it. Cresco Labs is already one of the largest cannabis operators in the U.S. Cresco claims a 28% market share in Illinois and a 30% market share in Pennsylvania. It's awaiting licensure in Michigan and closing of an acquisition in Florida. Once these transactions are finalized, Cresco will have operations in 11 states, including 15 production facilities, 21 operational retail dispensaries, and licenses for another 30 retail dispensaries. Origin House is the leading distributor of cannabis products in California, which has the largest legal marijuana market in the world. It has an expanding lineup of its own cannabis brands. The company is also poised to move into the Canadian recreational marijuana market in a major way with its acquisition of vape retailer 180 Smoke. Cresco Labs thinks that its acquisition of Origin House will create a \"North American cannabis powerhouse.\" CEO Charlie Bachtell said that the deal will give Cresco \"the largest and most strategic distribution footprint of any cannabis company in the United States.\" Origin House CEO Marc Lustig also sees a big advantage with the combination of the two companies. He stated, \"By partnering with one of the largest and most innovative U.S. multi-state operators in existence today, Origin House will supercharge its growth and be in a position to offer its brand partners access to 10 additional states, with licenses and supporting infrastructure already in place.\" 3. What it means for investors going forward The deal isn't done just yet. Both companies' boards of directors have unanimously approved the transaction. Cresco Labs' shareholders don't have to vote on the acquisition. However, a meeting will likely be held in June for Origin House shareholders to vote. Two-thirds of shares must be voted in favor of the deal for it to close, in addition to the normal regulatory approvals. Assuming the transaction does successfully close, Origin House shareholders will own around 20% of Cresco Labs. The big question then will be: Now what? It could be smart for investors to hold on for the ride. Cresco Labs projects pro forma combined revenue with Origin House in its fold this year of $383 million. By 2021, the company expects revenue of $1.04 billion and EBITDA of $317 million. And that's probably just the beginning. The U.S. marijuana market is expected to grow dramatically over the next several years, with some projecting a market of $22 billion by 2022 . There's also a multibillion-dollar hemp opportunity thanks to the legalization of hemp in the U.S. in December 2018. In February, Cresco Labs launched a subsidiary to target the hemp cannabidiol (CBD) market. If the acquisition of Origin House by Cresco Labs goes through, Cresco appears likely to become the sixth-largest cannabis operator by market cap. Although there seems to be some degree of disappointment for Origin House investors, the combined entity could be just what the two companies hope it will be -- a North American cannabis powerhouse. 10 stocks we like better than Origin House When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

He warned that the threat from IS is far from over, despite the announcement of the extremist group's territorial defeat in Syria last week.\nSalih spoke to The Associated Press in an exclusive interview Friday in Baghdad, a day before traveling to Tunis to attend an annual Arab summit meeting.\nSome 5,200 troops are stationed in Iraq as part of a security agreement with the Iraqi government to advise, assist and support the country's troops in the fight against Islamic State, which overran large parts of Iraq in 2014 after Iraqi forces collapsed, and proceeded to declare a self-styled caliphate over territory straddling Iraq and Syria. U.S. forces, which had left Iraq in 2011, were invited back to assist the fight against the group, and Iraq declared victory over IS in late 2017 after a ruinous and costly war.\nSalih's comments are in stark contrast with that of mostly Iran-backed deputies in the Iraqi Parliament, who say they are preparing draft laws calling for a full withdrawal of U.S. troops, now that the war against IS is over.\n'They are here for the specific mission of empowering and enabling Iraqi forces in the fight against ISIS. Nothing else. That is the specific exclusive mission, and in that context, I do not see serious opposition to the presence of these forces in Iraq today,' Salih said, using an acronym for Islamic State.\nHe said he recently led a conversation among all the major political groupings of the country and there is 'general consensus that that Iraq needs that collaboration.' He said a debate or vote is not scheduled in Parliament at the moment.\nRecent comments by President Donald Trump that he wanted U.S. troops to remain in Iraq to 'watch Iran' provoked outrage in Baghdad, fueling the debate about the presence of U.S. troops in Iraq. Salih said any mission beyond what has been agreed to by the Iraqi government 'is a subject that many political leaders of the country would take objection to.'

He warned that the threat from IS is far from over, despite the announcement of the extremist group's territorial defeat in Syria last week.\nSalih spoke to The Associated Press in an exclusive interview Friday in Baghdad, a day before traveling to Tunis to attend an annual Arab summit meeting.\nSome 5,200 troops are stationed in Iraq as part of a security agreement with the Iraqi government to advise, assist and support the country's troops in the fight against Islamic State, which overran large parts of Iraq in 2014 after Iraqi forces collapsed, and proceeded to declare a self-styled caliphate over territory straddling Iraq and Syria. U.S. forces, which had left Iraq in 2011, were invited back to assist the fight against the group, and Iraq declared victory over IS in late 2017 after a ruinous and costly war.\nSalih's comments are in stark contrast with that of mostly Iran-backed deputies in the Iraqi Parliament, who say they are preparing draft laws calling for a full withdrawal of U.S. troops, now that the war against IS is over.\n'They are here for the specific mission of empowering and enabling Iraqi forces in the fight against ISIS. Nothing else. That is the specific exclusive mission, and in that context, I do not see serious opposition to the presence of these forces in Iraq today,' Salih said, using an acronym for Islamic State.\nHe said he recently led a conversation among all the major political groupings of the country and there is 'general consensus that that Iraq needs that collaboration.' He said a debate or vote is not scheduled in Parliament at the moment.\nRecent comments by President Donald Trump that he wanted U.S. troops to remain in Iraq to 'watch Iran' provoked outrage in Baghdad, fueling the debate about the presence of U.S. troops in Iraq. Salih said any mission beyond what has been agreed to by the Iraqi government 'is a subject that many political leaders of the country would take objection to.'

With a load of highly-anticipated companies planning to go public in 2019, he said it's a sign that investors must be very careful buying red-hot initial public offerings. Those include names such as Pinterest, Uber, and Airbnb.\nBut there is a way to make money on the IPO frenzy without buying the new stocks, Cramer said.\n\"If you want to play the IPO boom without taking the immense risk of buying these stocks right out of the gate, embrace the indirect approach and buy the more consistent winners here like Nasdaq, Goldman Sachs and Amazon,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\nInvest in the exchanges Cramer said investors can buy the stock exchanges that will list the oncoming IPOs. The usual suspects on the U.S. market are the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, he said.\n\"Given where most of these deals are coming, I think Nasdaq's stock is the way to go,\" Cramer said.\nLevi Strauss went public less than two weeks ago on the NYSE, but was the only new name to list on that market in the first quarter. The Nasdaq brought 17 deals, including Lyft, to market in the first three months of the year, he noted.\nAdditionally, Lyft was the Nasdaq's largest IPO since the faulty debut of Facebook on the tech-focused exchange in 2012. At the time, Facebook's stumble worried many tech companies, which pushed notable names such as Twitter, Alibaba, and Snap Inc. to list on the NYSE, Cramer said.\nUber and Pinterest have also opted for the NYSE, but the host thinks the Nasdaq is in position to land big deals in the future.\n\"Nasdaq delivered 11 percent organic revenue growth, double digit, in its latest quarter. That's a nice acceleration and 21 percent earnings growth,\" Cramer said. \"Plus, with Nasdaq's stock trading at less than 16 times next year's earnings estimates, I think it's a bargain.\"\nUnderwriters The investment banks that underwrite an IPO are well compensated, Cramer said. Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan handled the Levi's and Lyft offerings, respectively, and both firms will play a role in Pinterest's listing this year, he noted.\n\"Goldman Sachs is a pure-play investment bank ... their underwriting business is much more of a needle-mover than JP Morgan,\" he said. \"They win a bunch of these deals and it will really bolster their earnings power ... The IPO boom could be the catalyst that finally gets this, the cheapest on a price-to-earnings multiple brokerage stock that there is, [moving].\"\nUber is going through its public offering process with Morgan Stanley, which should be a \"lucrative\" deal for the bank, Cramer said.\n\"Again, the financials are an unloved group, but these IPOs give you a reason to bet on the investment banks,\" he said.\nAmazon Amazon doesn't have direct exposure to the IPO market, but there is a high chance that its cloud segment does business with the company that's filing, Cramer said.\nSnap Inc. had $1 billion worth of business with Amazon Web Services at its initial offering, the host said. In Lyft's case, the ride-hailing company will pay the Amazon's cloud arm $300 million over the next three years, he said. While Pinterest is set to pay the company $750 million over a six-year period through 2023, he added.\n\"Amazon Web Services dominates this business. Their next largest competitors, [Alphabet subsidiary] Google and Microsoft, don't even come close,\" Cramer said. \"So as we see this parade of tech IPOs ... it's telling us how much \u2014 each one of them seems to have a deal with Amazon.\"\nAWS revenue grew 47 percent in 2018.\nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

It emerges in the United States, where Zionists, Jews and Christians alike use the dances to celebrate their affiliation with Israel.\nThis time, I am collaborating with a group of performers with various relationships to Zionism and folk traditions. The work proposes a way of breaking the cycles of transmission, appropriation, and theft-- concepts that have present-day consequences for Palestinians, Israelis and Americans.\nThis next phase of making this work requires a diversity of views, experiences and identities, in order to engage with these questions. Settler pioneers dancing hora at Kibbutz Ein Harod in the Jizreel Valley 1930s What are Israeli folk dances?\nToday, there are more than 8,000 dances, including the earliest Israeli dances as well as a newer generation created by Israeli choreographers of diverse backgrounds. The dances are practiced internationally by folk dancers, Zionist Jews, and Christians alike.\nSong and dance rituals were created specifically to embody a nationalist agenda leading up to the creation of the State of Israel. The folk dance movement was spearheaded by Ashkenazi (of European descent) Jewish Zionists, and expressed their desire to return or become \u201cnative\u201d in Israel-Palestine. First Israeli Folk Dance Conference 1944 on Kibbutz Daliah\nTo transform into \u2018new\u2019 \u2018oriental\u2019 Jews, choreographers designed new ways of celebrating holidays, costumes, new dance steps and music based on European folk traditions and steps appropriated from Arab communities- Yemenite Jews, Druz, Bedouin and Palestinians. These moves parallel the violent ruptures Zionism brought on these people: dislocation and dispossession from their own land and rituals.\nIsraeli folk dances were performed and disseminated in the United States starting in the 1950s to Jewish communities as a way to build affiliation with the nascent state of Israel.\nIsraeli folk dances offer a sense of liberation, community, and affiliation with Israel. They can also be examined to trace the contradictions and conflicts within Israeli society and in Israel-Palestine. Passover pageant in our dining room, in the tradition of Kibbutz holidays. My sisters and I are Miriam and the women, carrying trays like tambourines. What has my research process been like? I\u2019ve scoured the databases that exist to preserve and disseminate the dances. I\u2019ve traced the history of particular dances while reading about histories of Palestinian Dabke and Israeli folk dance by scholars of various orientations. I've developed a dance workshops to teach a history of Israel-Palestine through a non-Zionist framework . I\u2019ve participated in solidarity work with organizers of nonviolent resistance to Israeli occupation in Israel-Palestine. I\u2019ve traveled to Poland with the support of Movement Research GPS to share my work, learn Polish dances that were rejected by Zionist choreographers , I visited the town my great grandfather left in the 1920s before he settled in the Jezreel Valley. And, now, I work with a group of collaborators to uncover our own entryways to this work, through embodied practice, research, vocalizing, and storytelling.

This means our analysis is international and intersectional.\nTheir participation in this project does not mean they completely align with anti-Zionist politics or each others politics .

EPA 4 80 per cent of tariff revenue from the UK goes direct to Brussels\nSince then, our Remainer-stuffed Parliament has pulled every trick in the book to keep us as close to the European Union as possible. And now MPs want Britain to stay inside the customs union , the EU\u2019s most important legal construct, while claiming they \u201cstill respect the referendum result\u201d.\nThis is abject nonsense. The customs union is enshrined in the 1957 Treaty of Rome, the EU\u2019s legal bedrock. The EU is, in essence, the customs union.\nBeing inside but nominally outside the EU \u2014 as our power-crazed, economically illiterate MPs now demand \u2014 is the worst of all worlds.\nThe UK would then be like Turkey, ensnared within the EU tariff structures but with no say.\nEU members would control utterly the trade policy of the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy, determining what goods can enter our country. And we\u2019d keep sending billions of pounds each year to Brussels.\nIs that \u201ctaking back control of our law, borders and money\u201d? Is that \u201crespecting the referendum result\u201d? DIG HEELS IN\nThe EU\u2019s protectionist customs union puts a tariff wall around all member states, imposing charges on goods imported into the EU from the rest of the world.\nThis Common External Tariff (CET) makes imports of clothing, food and footwear, in particular, more expensive \u2014 items on which poorer households spend heavily.\nSo British shoppers often end up paying more, to protect inefficient producers elsewhere in the EU and shielding them from global competition.\nLarge, powerful EU companies like tariff barriers as they help them to retain business. But that\u2019s at the direct expense of consumers. And the UK suffers most as we\u2019re the only large European economy that does most of our trade outside the EU.\nThe CET on clothing is around 12 per cent, while on shoes from leading Asian suppliers it\u2019s up at 60 per cent.\nEU tariffs also make food more expensive \u2014 outside the customs union, grocery bills could fall by up to 20 per cent, says the Policy Exchange think tank. PM Theresa May and Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn row over whether a Brexit deal should involve a customs union\nTo add insult to injury, four-fifths of EU tariff revenues collected in the UK each year are sent directly to Brussels.\nOver the past eight years, Britain has shelled out \u00a318billion in such tariffs \u2014 enough to pay for more than 100,000 extra nurses over that entire period. Poor UK households paying over the odds for non-EU imports have footed much of that bill.\nWe are told being in the customs union means Britain benefits from the EU\u2019s \u201c60-plus\u201d free-trade agreements with other nations. But fewer than half these deals are in force \u2014 and most are with minnows and microstates.\nAll the EU\u2019s operational trade deals combined cover less than a tenth of the global economy .\nThe EU is bad at striking trade deals as member states\u2019 interests often conflict \u2014 and the French always dig their heels in on agriculture. That\u2019s why, after years of trying, there is no EU free trade agreement with either the US or China and India \u2014 the coming economic superpowers.\nAll the EU's operational trade deals combined cover less than a tenth of the global economy\nBritain has more chance of securing valuable agreements negotiating alone, as Switzerland did with China in 2014.\nWe can cut deals favouring sectors where we are strong, such as services, not skewed towards French and German interests, as EU deals often are.\nWe are a services giant \u2014 the world\u2019s second-largest producer \u2014 which is why sizeable nations with EU agreements, such as South Korea and Mexico, say they want bespoke post-Brexit trade deals with us.\nBig business lobby groups want Britain to stay in the customs union, as they care more about protecting incumbent, inefficient corporations than democracy.\nYet leaving will boost the UK\u2019s smaller, dynamic firms, as new agreements help them export to the world\u2019s fastest-growing Eastern markets.\nAnd shoppers will also benefit, freed from paying tariffs on global imports, while seeing further price falls as we strike trade deals with leading global economies, deals the protectionist EU has failed to clinch in 60 years of trying. NO SENSE\nIn the early Seventies, when Britain joined what became the EU , the bloc made up 40 per cent of the global economy.\nOnce Britain leaves, that share falls to 15 per cent, despite the EU now having far more member states.\nIt makes no sense for a diverse, competitive economy such as Britain to hide behind a tariff wall harming our consumers and discriminating against 85 per cent of the world economy.\nWe need to leave the EU\u2019s backward-looking customs union, just as voters said in June 2016. We don\u2019t need the customs union to protect UK manufacturing supply chains.\nMore goods cross the US\u2013Canada border each year than the EU-UK border, with no delays and with no customs union .\nAnd the idea only the customs union can save Northern Ireland from renewed conflict is alarmist nonsense.

The path has been slow and arduous. Like most things Apple, the grand vision and execution unfolded on the company\u2019s own schedule and not on any predetermined timeline. Apple sometimes leads, sometimes follows, but often invents a whole new category.\nAt its event last Monday, Apple unveiled a no-fee, cash-back credit card available in the United States in partnership with Goldman Sachs, that comes with an Apple-branded titanium card. Chief executive Tim Cook called the move \u201cthe most significant change in the credit-card experience in 50 years.\u201d\nStory continues below advertisement\nThe Apple Card embedded and enabled on the iPhone is a game changer. Why? Apple will retain full data rights within its ecosystem (albeit used and processed within devices rather than Apple servers). This means Apple and its partners can offer financial products right on the iPhone. Apple Card will have immediate and deep financial connectivity and it will be able to see everyday purchases in real time, while populating a rewards card in real time. So where is this going?\nAt Framework Venture Partners, we believe that the future of finance will be shaped by what we\u2019ve labelled Fintech 2.0. Simply put, our thesis is that standalone financial products and services will largely disappear and will instead become embedded in the flow of applications people use every day. The value won\u2019t just be from this integration, but rather from the way in which artificial intelligence will enable purchases, savings and lending to be managed and delivered in an optimal and intuitive way.\nCombining real-world attributes with digital footprints into a seamless product will change the face of banking and ultimately the experience of businesses and consumers. Imagine for a moment that the Apple Card is used for all of a person\u2019s daily transactions. After some relatively short period of time, say 12 to 24 months, Apple will be able to tell with a high percentage of accuracy what a person\u2019s income, financial and personal situation looks like on an intimate level.\nThis itemized visibility will mean that Apple is likely to forecast when you get married, have children or will be looking to make a major purchases. With all this data, Apple could then offer this person real-time money movements, savings, investments and even mortgages with virtually no paperwork. More importantly, Apple could offer these products with preapproved amounts and rates customized to that person\u2019s projected credit risk.\nWhile this seems scary to some, to millennials who are struggling with personal financial literacy, this may be the solution they were looking for. Only 24 per cent of today\u2019s millennials demonstrated basic financial knowledge, according to a study in the United States by PwC. The need for help has become a chronic societal issue.\nEnter Apple: Getting advice in real time on how to save, how to spend and finding solutions for this in real time is the future. Our belief is that within 10 years, Apple Card will migrate into Apple Finance. This shift will direct you where to buy your next pair of shoes at the best price within your budget. Apple will be able to take your excess savings and provide products optimized for your personal situation. Ultimately, placing cash within the Apple supply chain could displace Wall Street\u2019s savings accounts, investment funds and much more.\nWhile the timing of all of this is difficult to predict, what isn\u2019t difficult to guess is that Apple won\u2019t stop with Apple Card. The future of fintech is clearly on the smartphone and within software, not inside a branch and mainframes.\nStory continues below advertisement\nRelated", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peter misek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim cook", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "apple card", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "framework venture partners lp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T02:01:30.040+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5f0a5e94379f4b5137ad573b26cd703a02b10f92", "url": "https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2019/04/01/america-would-run-out-of-avocados-in-3-weeks-if-president-trump-closes-us-mexico-border-experts-warn/", "site_full": "philadelphia.cbslocal.com", "site": "cbslocal.com", "site_section": "http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media", "entertainment"], "section_title": "CBS Philly", "title": "America Would Run Out Of Avocados In 3 Weeks If President Trump Closes US-Mexico Border, Experts Warn", "title_full": "America Would Run Out Of Avocados In 3 Weeks If President Trump Closes US-Mexico Border, Experts Warn", "published": "2019-04-02T01:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/gettyimages-620942216.jpg?w=1500", "performance_score": 4, "domain_rank": 1192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1997, "comments": 1961, "shares": 482}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5f0a5e94379f4b5137ad573b26cd703a02b10f92", "url": "https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2019/04/01/america-would-run-out-of-avocados-in-3-weeks-if-president-trump-closes-us-mexico-border-experts-warn/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CBS Philly", "published": "2019-04-02T01:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "America Would Run Out Of Avocados In 3 Weeks If President Trump Closes US-Mexico Border, Experts Warn", "text": "8:30 PM Man with a Plan 9:00 PM Magnum P.I.

Xi told the prominent group, including ex-political leaders from around the world, that China is dedicated to supporting multilateral processes. [Photo by Feng Yongbin/ For China Daily]\nChina would like to walk in the same direction as the United States, handle their disputes and expand cooperation, President Xi Jinping said on Monday.\nXi made the remark while meeting with a delegation of global leaders called The Elders at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. The independent group was founded in 2007 by Nelson Mandela, former president of South Africa.\nXi told the group that Sino-US ties are among the world's most important bilateral relationships. China would like to develop its relations with the US on the basis of coordination, cooperation and stability to provide more certainty and predictability for the world, he added.\nThe relationship between major countries affects the strategic stability of the world, and major countries shoulder special responsibilities, Xi said.\nChina is dedicated to promoting coordination and cooperation between major countries, Xi said, adding that China expects to maintain friendly relations with major countries, avoid conflicts and confrontation, respect each other and cooperate for win-win results.\nXi said the impact of unilateralism has worried many countries, but support for multilateralism remains the mainstream of the international community.\nChina continues to support the multilateral processes including maintaining the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and enhancing the cooperation on climate change, Xi said.\nThe Belt and Road Initiative put forward by China is an important contribution to multilateralism and global cooperation, Xi said, adding that China has worked with other countries to innovate in cooperation in the past five years.\nAs a developing major country, China pursues win-win cooperation and helps all developing nations achieve common development, Xi said, adding that the BRI aims for mutual benefits.\nMost of the members of The Elders are leaders of international organizations and former political leaders including Ban Ki-moon, former secretary-general of the United Nations, and Ernesto Zedillo, former president of Mexico. Its chairwoman is Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland.\nMembers spoke highly of China's achievements in environmental protection, poverty reduction and ethnic relations and development.\nChina has played a constructive role as a responsible major country at a time when multilateralism is facing challenges, and Xi's speeches at international events have sent positive signals, they said.\nNoting that this year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Robinson said that China has made great progress in the recent decades, and she has seen great changes in China.\n\"We hope to really have a continuing dialogue with China on issues because they are quite urgent now,\" she said, adding that multilateralism is \"going through a difficult time\".

Summers Jr. said.\n\"Should Turkey procure the S-400, their continued participation in the F-35 programme is at risk,\" he said in a statement.\nUS officials have voiced concern that, with Turkey in both camps, Russia could obtain F-35 data to improve the accuracy of the S-400 against Western aircraft.\nThe Pentagon said that it had started to look at secondary sources to produce parts for F-35s that were being developed in Turkey.\nAdvertisement Advertisement \"We very much regret the current situation facing our F-35 partnership with Turkey, but the (Defence Department) is taking prudent steps to protect the shared investments made in our critical technology,\" Summers said.\nTurkey had planned to buy 100 F-35A fighter jets, with pilots already training in the United States. The plane's manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, said that contracts with Turkish companies to build parts for the F-35 had been expected to reach US$12 billion.\nAmong the eight Turkish companies involved in the purchase, Ayesas has been building a panoramic cockpit display for the F-35 and Fokker Elmo makes 40 per cent of the electrical wiring and interconnection system, according to Lockheed Martin.\nGROWING TILT TO RUSSIA\nThe purchase of a Russian system is highly unusual for a member of NATO, the Western alliance forged to counter the Soviet Union.\nThe US suspension announcement comes two days before foreign ministers from the 29 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation are due in Washington to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the alliance - and hours after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's AKP party suffered a surprise rout in elections in major cities including Istanbul.\nErdogan, whose relations with the West have soured sharply as he cracks down on dissent at home, has increasingly looked to Moscow as a partner. Russian tourists have made Turkey their top destination, providing a vital economic boost.\nLast week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov travelled to Turkey, where Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu insisted that the S-400 purchase would go ahead.\n\"We have an agreement with Russia and we are bound by it,\" Cavusoglu told reporters.\nHoping to offer an alternative, the United States last year approved the sale of Patriot missiles to Turkey - a deal to which Ankara said it was open.\nFour senators last week proposed legally barring the transfer of F-35s to Turkey if it buys the S-400. One of the senators, Democrat Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, praised the Pentagon suspension and pledged to \"continue working in the Senate to prevent this dangerous possibility from becoming a reality.\"\nROCKY TIES WITH US\nTurkey's relations with the United States plunged last year when President Donald Trump imposed tariffs, battering Turkey's lira, over the jailing of an American pastor detained as part of a mass roundup following a coup attempt against Erdogan.\nThe pastor, Andrew Brunson, was freed and Trump appeared to grow fond of Erdogan, speaking to him before his sudden decision to withdraw US troops from Syria.\nAmerican pastor Andrew Brunson, freed from prison in Turkey, prays for US President Donald Trump at the White House in October 2018. (AFP/ROBERTO SCHMIDT)\nBut tensions quickly resurfaced with the United States fearful that Erdogan will strike US-allied Kurdish fighters in Syria and a Turkish court trying a US consulate staffer, Metin Topuz, on charges of spying.\nTopuz, a Turkish citizen, is accused of ties to Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish preacher who lives in self-imposed exile in the United States. Erdogan has repeatedly demanded that the United States extradite Gulen, whom the Turkish leader accuses of fomenting the coup.\nSource: Reuters", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "charles e. summers jr.", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T02:15:45.030+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5f2d752a96781d8f96af82477550e423e8114c60", "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/benefitfocus-kicks-off-national-employee-benefits-day-at-nasdaq-stock-market-ringing-the-opening-bell-on-tuesday-april-2-2019-300821762.html", "site_full": "www.prnewswire.com", "site": "prnewswire.com", "site_section": "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/telecommunications-latest-news/networks-list/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "All Networks News and Press Releases from PR Newswire", "title": "Benefitfocus Kicks Off National Employee Benefits Day at NASDAQ Stock Market Ringing the Opening Bell on Tuesday April 2, 2019", "title_full": "Benefitfocus Kicks Off National Employee Benefits Day at NASDAQ Stock Market Ringing the Opening Bell on Tuesday April 2, 2019", "published": "2019-04-01T16:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/339766/Benefitfocus_Logo.jpg?p=facebook", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3190, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5f2d752a96781d8f96af82477550e423e8114c60", "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/benefitfocus-kicks-off-national-employee-benefits-day-at-nasdaq-stock-market-ringing-the-opening-bell-on-tuesday-april-2-2019-300821762.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Benefitfocus, Inc.", "published": "2019-04-01T16:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "Benefitfocus Kicks Off National Employee Benefits Day at NASDAQ Stock Market Ringing the Opening Bell on Tuesday April 2, 2019", "text": "CHARLESTON, S.C.

New York:\nBoeing must perform more work on a proposed fix to its 737 MAX aircraft before it can be submitted for review, US officials said Monday, suggesting the planes could stay grounded a while longer.\nAdditional work is needed \"to ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues,\" a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said in a statement.\n\"The FAA will not approve the software for installation until the agency is satisfied with the submission,\" he added.\nThe FAA statement is the bureaucratic equivalent of a \"stop\" sign after Boeing officials touted their proposed remedy last week during a media tour at the company's manufacturing plant in Seattle, Washington.\nBoeing's 737 MAX planes were grounded globally last month following the second of two deadly crashes to occur in less than five months.\nScrutiny has centered on an anti-stall system developed specifically for the planes that has given pilots problems.\nA preliminary report into the second calamity - the March 10 crash of a Boeing 737 MAX 8 that killed 157 people - will likely be issued this week, the Ethiopian government said Monday.\nBoeing last week gathered hundreds of pilots and reporters at its Renton, Washington manufacturing site for a presentation on proposed changes to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which is believed to have been a key factor in the Ethiopian crash and in an October crash of a Lion Air in Indonesia that killed 189 people.\nAmong the changes, the MCAS will no longer repeatedly make corrections when the pilot tries to regain control, and will automatically disconnect in the event of disagreements between the two \"angle of attack,\" or AOA sensors, the company said last week.\nBoeing is anxious to win approval for a proposed remedy that could get the planes back in the air.\nBut the FAA, which faced harsh questioning last week at a congressional hearing regarding its oversight of Boeing, said it expected Boeing to submit the proposed fix \"over the coming weeks\" after it undertakes additional work.\nAfter that, the proposal will be submitted to a \"rigorous safety review,\" the FAA spokesman said.\nA Boeing spokesman said Monday the company was continuing to work with regulators to address concerns.\n\"We are working to demonstrate that we have identified and appropriately addressed all certification requirements and will be submitting for FAA review once completed in the coming weeks,\" the Boeing spokesman said.\n\"Safety is our first priority and we will take a thorough and methodical approach to the development and testing of the update to ensure we take the time to get it right.\"\nPreliminary Report This Week\nEarlier Monday, Ethiopian foreign ministry spokesman Nebiat Getachew had said his country's transport ministry would release \"a preliminary report into its investigation\" of the March 10 accident in which a Nairobi-bound Boeing 737 MAX crashed shortly after taking off from Addis Ababa.\nThe Ethiopian government gave no details on the exact timing of the release, nor hints about the report's findings.\nNebiat initially said the report would be released Monday but the transport ministry, which is in charge of investigations, later said this would take several days.\n\"The report will most likely be released some day later this week,\" ministry spokesman Mussie Yiheyes said.\nIt was not clear Monday if the transport ministry's preliminary report would be made public straight away, or limited to the eyes of authorities including the FAA.\nThe plane's black boxes are being examined by France's BEA air safety agency, working with American and Ethiopian investigators to determine what went wrong.\nAnti-Stall System\nA source with knowledge of the investigation has said an anti-stalling system, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), was activated shortly before the crash.\nBoeing designed the automated MCAS system - which lowers the aircraft's nose if it detects a stall or loss of airspeed - for this particular model.\nThe same system was implicated in the October crash, with initial investigations finding that a sensor on the plane had transmitted incorrect information to the MCAS system.\nThe pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 struggled to control the aircraft as the MCAS repeatedly pushed the plane's nose down, according to the flight data recorder.\nThe pilot had tried repeatedly to regain control and pull the nose up but the plane crashed into the sea.\nBoth the planes in Indonesia and Ethiopia reportedly experienced erratic steep climbs and descents, as well as fluctuating airspeeds, before crashing shortly after takeoff.\nEthiopia has already said there were \"clear similarities\" between the two MAX 8 crashes.\nEthiopian Airlines is Africa's largest carrier and in many ways the international face of the nation.

Korea, U.S. reaffirm commitment to support inter-Korean military accord\n(ATTN: CHANGES dateline; RECASTS headline, lead; UPDATES throughout)\nWASHINGTON/SEOUL, April 2 (Yonhap) -- The defense chiefs of South Korea and the United States have reaffirmed their commitment to closely coordinating to support last year's inter-Korean military accord aimed at reducing border tensions and building trust, their offices said.\nDuring their talks in Washington on Monday, Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo and acting U.S. Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan also reiterated their will to closely cooperate to expedite the fulfillment of conditions needed for Washington's envisioned transfer of wartime operational control (OPCON) to Seoul.\nJeong and Shanahan met face to face for the first time since the latter took the Pentagon post in January.\n\"The secretary and the minister assessed that implementation of the Comprehensive Military Agreement (CMA) has contributed to the easing of military tension and confidence building on the Korean Peninsula,\" Seoul's defense ministry and the Pentagon said in a press release.\nThe Koreas' defense chiefs signed the CMA at the close of the third summit between President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang last September. It entails a series of trust-building and arms control measures under a broader scheme to halt all hostile acts against each other.\nJeong and Shanahan underscored their will to closely cooperate to further reinforce the alliance through the \"synchronized\" efforts of their militaries amid ongoing peace efforts with North Korea.\n\"The secretary and minister affirmed that the U.S.-ROK Alliance is 'ironclad' and ready to face an evolving security environment,\" the press release reads.\n\"The two sides reaffirmed the commitment to maintain an unwavering combined readiness posture while continuing to support the ongoing diplomatic efforts to achieve complete denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula,\" it added.\nGen. Robert Abrams, the commander of the South Korea-U.S. Combined Forces Command, gave the defense chiefs an evaluation of the allies' recently revised exercise, saying that they have strengthened the militaries' combined readiness and contributed to the groundwork for the OPCON transfer.\nAbrams was referring to the recently concluded Dong Maeng command post exercise that replaced the springtime Key Resolve exercise. Dong Maeng is the Korean word for alliance.\nJeong and Shanahan also agreed to work toward initial operational capability (IOC) certification of a South Korea-led combined defense posture later this year, and committed to stay in close consultation, the press release said.\nSeoul and Washington have been pushing for the conditions-based OPCON transfer after which the former will lead wartime operations with the latter playing a supporting role.\nFollowing the IOC certification slated for this summer, the two sides are expected to verify Seoul's full operational and mission capabilities in the following years.\nBefore their talks, Shanahan said that the allies learned \"lessons\" from the Dong Maeng exercise and will look to apply them to future drills.\n\"Our teams play a vital role in support of diplomacy,\" Shanahan said.\nThe recent exercise was \"very successful,\" he said, but, \"We've also learned about improvements we can make in our fall exercises.\"\nThis photo shows South Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo (L) meeting with acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan (R) at the Pentagon, near Washington, on April 1, 2019. (Yonhap)\nJeong echoed the assessment that the drill concluded \"successfully\" and added that it served as a \"useful\" opportunity to confirm the allies' firm defense posture.\nAsked by a reporter whether he shares the concerns that scaling back exercises could hurt readiness, Shanahan disagreed that they are being scaled back.\n\"I think we're building capability,\" he said. \"We want to make sure that there are no gaps, that we continue to build on these exercises. We're going to talk about the September exercises and the lessons learned from these ones in March.\"\nHe was also asked whether the U.S. plans to ask South Korea to pay for the joint use of a U.S.-controlled wartime command bunker in South Korea known as CP Tango. He responded that those discussions aren't on Monday's agenda.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in is due to travel to Washington to meet U.S. President Donald Trump on April 11.\nhague@yna.co.kr\n(END)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeong kyeong-doo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shanahan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick shanahan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeong", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "yonhap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defense", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "opcon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s. korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korean peninsula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T02:22:58.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "31e6a6ccdcff569e5615d7a802cf5cac31be1e08", "url": "http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/7705995/this-is-us-r-b-cs", "site_full": "www.opensubtitles.org", "site": "opensubtitles.org", "site_section": "http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/rss_2_00", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "opensubtitles.org - subtitle search results", "title": "\"This Is Us\" R & B - Czech (1CD ) - subtitles", "title_full": "\"This Is Us\" R & B - Czech (1CD ) - subtitles", "published": "2019-04-02T02:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SK", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1713, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "31e6a6ccdcff569e5615d7a802cf5cac31be1e08", "url": "http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/7705995/this-is-us-r-b-cs", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T02:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "\"This Is Us\" R & B - Czech (1CD ) - subtitles", "text": "To download our subtitles, install Chrome extension ; click on 1. \" Add to Chrome \" 2. \" Add Extension \" If you install our extension you will remove all ads and waiting time on this website Thank you !\nTo download our subtitles, install Firefox add-on ; click on 1. \" Add to Firefox \" 2. \" Add \" If you install our extension you will remove all ads and waiting time on this website Thank you !

How a US military town weighs the choice", "text": "At Fort Bragg, America\u2019s largest military base by population , the upgrade of an elementary school could be postponed. Ditto for some refueling infrastructure at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. And funds for improvements at Camp Lejeune, a Marine base still struggling to recover after the damage of Hurricane Florence, are at risk. President Donald Trump wants to fund an expansion of walls on the Mexican border by diverting some $3.6 billion in funds currently slated for United States military construction.\nBut the president\u2019s push raises a question that has deeper resonance here in North Carolina (home to each of the bases mentioned above) and in other conservative-leaning states: What happens when a Republican president borrows money from one national-security effort to finance another one?\nRecommended: Mueller report stokes political rift. Could it inspire some unity too?\nIn the communities surrounding Fort Bragg, views of Mr. Trump\u2019s stratagem are varied. Many worry about shortchanging the needs of U.S. servicemen and women, and their families, or the local economy. Others doubt a border barrier will be effective. But even here, in a place that advertises itself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s most military-friendly state,\u201d views are heavily shaped by opinions about immigration. Many residents interviewed support the president\u2019s move, saying the situation at the U.S. border is now a genuine security crisis.\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing a great job and he better keep it up,\u201d says Charles Hurlburt, a retiree near Fort Bragg who served 23 years in the Army, including during the Vietnam War. Without control of the border, he says, \u201cyou\u2019ll lose control of the country.\u201d\nWill diverting money from military training facilities and children\u2019s schools toward the border reduce national defense readiness? Mr. Hurlburt doesn\u2019t think so, saying \u201cwe never lacked\u201d when he was in the service, and that Mr. Trump \u201chas done a lot for the military.\u201d\nOn immigration, Mr. Hurlburt says more oversight is needed. \u201cThere\u2019s a way to come to this country. And there\u2019s a way not to come to this country.\u201d His wife is from Panama, and he recounts that it was only after several years of marriage that she got citizenship. Given that so many have made lives in the U.S. after arriving illegally, he says those who are law-abiding and pay taxes \u201cought to be moved to the head of the line.\u201d\nBut views on the trade-off of border security versus national security span the map here, as elsewhere, depending in part on whether immigrants are viewed as industrious people fleeing violence and poverty or as free riders who use a porous border to game America\u2019s welfare system.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a waste of money,\u201d says military retiree Charles L. Miller, referring to the border wall. He voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 but, as he stops to run an errand in the town of Spring Lake on the edge of Fort Bragg, he says the president\u2019s emergency declaration is \u201coverstepping his authority.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not that Mr. Miller doesn\u2019t care about a secure border. \u201cI just don\u2019t think the wall is the solution,\u201d he says.\nA few miles away, Jeanine Dodson agrees with Trump\u2019s border-funding plan, and she worries about the cost of immigrants to American taxpayers. As for concerns about cuts to military spending, she figures it\u2019s at most a temporary setback.\n\u201cIf we have border security and we stop feeding billions of dollars to illegals, then it wouldn\u2019t take long\u201d before the government has fresh money available for the military needs, she says.\nAmericans\u2019 diverging views on immigration may be evolving alongside the security situation on the border. Although illegal border crossings are hovering near historic lows , March is on pace for 100,000 apprehensions by border authorities \u2013 the most in any month in more than a decade.\nCustoms and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said last week that a \u201cbreaking point\u201d had arrived . The Border Patrol is struggling with housing those who are apprehended and meeting the health needs of migrants who increasingly are families with children.\nOn Friday, President Trump announced plans to cut off foreign aid for three Central American nations \u2013 Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador \u2013 which are now the leading source of migrants crossing the southern U.S. border. Mr. Trump also threatened a move that would be economically damaging to both the U.S. and Mexico: close the southern U.S. border to trade and travel, unless Mexico does more to stop the immigrant flow.\nMany Americans are concerned about border security, but only 44 percent favor Mr. Trump\u2019s idea of a new border wall, versus 51 percent opposed, according to an early March national poll by Monmouth University. When asked if they supported an emergency declaration so that military funds could be diverted to the border, support fell to 33 percent, versus 65 percent opposed.\nWhile leaning conservative in many ways, North Carolina can be a swing state in presidential elections. Many in this region are more supportive of the armed forces than they are of Mr. Trump. Fort Bragg, near the city of Fayetteville in the center of the state, is the heart of the Army\u2019s airborne and special operations forces. Fayetteville in 2008 began describing itself as a \u201c sanctuary for soldiers ,\u201d signaling its efforts to provide special support to military families.\n\u201cWe like to see our military protected,\u201d says Kerri Ross, a longtime resident. \u201cThey\u2019ll be hurting\u201d because of his plans, she says. \u201cThe housing for our military families is atrocious.\u201d\nPart of a family with deep ties to the armed forces, she worries service members will be shortchanged because, in her view, \u201che wants a Trump Wall as a legacy.\u201d\nAs for the border, \u201cI\u2019ve lived in California and Arizona,\u201d Ms. Ross says. \u201cPeople want in, and they\u2019re going to find a way to get in.\u201d\nIn his latest budget proposal, the president requested $8.6 billion in wall funding. But with little hope of that passing a divided Congress, he has also turned toward the use of military funds. The Department of Defense recently responded with a list of projects that could potentially be postponed, narrowing that list down to $4.3 billion in projects that would avoid cuts to military housing or dormitory improvements.\nStill, many North Carolina civilians worry about the message sent by delaying military projects. \u201cIt\u2019ll hurt us in the long run,\u201d says Martin Lee, a Spring Lake resident who works at a nearby perfume factory. The military budget is \u201csomething he shouldn\u2019t be messing with.\u201d\nBrent Sides, who unlike Mr. Lee was a Trump supporter in 2016, is also wary. On this early spring day, with the warm sun coaxing nearby buds and blossoms to open, Mr. Sides has just finished painting the outlines of some new parking spaces at a Food Lion near Fort Bragg.\nHe laments that Congress and the White House haven\u2019t been able to strike a bargain on immigration and border policies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming to just butting heads,\u201d he says of Washington politics. Although he calls enhanced border security \u201cthe right thing to do,\u201d he says \u201cit\u2019s got to be a good plan.\u201d\nRelated stories\nBriefing Is there a border crisis?

Most of them make no bones about saying that wining the election is not their objective.\nAmong the first contenders against Modi is Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan, the president of the Bhim Army, a five-year-old Dalit organisation. Azad, who staged a road show in Varanasi on March 30 and declared that \u201cthe countdown to Modi\u2019s defeat has begun\u201d, attracts youths from the Dalit sections because of his fiery speeches.\nThe second unlikely opponent to Modi is former constable in the Border Security Force (BSF) Tej Bahadur Yadav, who made headlines after he uploaded a video last year criticising the allegedly sub-standard food served to BSF jawans.\nIn what appears to be an honest answer to justify his decision, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s only about the high-profile constituency that Varanasi is. I can use it as a platform to highlight concerns of troopers. I may not win, but I only want to send out a message.\u201d Yadav, who was dismissed from service after his allegations were declared false by a court of inquiry, plans to contest as an independent. Also willing to challenge Modi is a motley group of farmers from Tamil Nadu who had staged a demonstration in Delhi in 2017 to highlight their demands such as profitable prices for farm produce. The group, comprising 111 farmers, is led by P Ayyakannu.\nThe latest contender against Modi is again a group from down south. Two victims of fluorosis from Nalgonda (Telangana) and Prakasam (Andhra Pradesh), led by two activists, Vadde Srinivas and Jalagam Sudheer, are planning to join the fray.\n(With inputs from Rohan Dua and Sushil Rao)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vara", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "dalit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "azad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chandrashekhar azad ravan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tej bahadur yadav", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "border security force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhim army", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lucknow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "varanasi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T02:26:51.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f7111beef8bb6c8a35434dd516488b1aeb229705", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/01/cramer-nasdaq-goldman-sachs-and-amazon-are-de-risked-ipo-plays.html", "site_full": "www.cnbc.com", "site": "cnbc.com", "site_section": "http://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Top News &amp; Analysis", "title": "Cramer: Nasdaq, Goldman Sachs, and Amazon are de-risked IPO plays", "title_full": "Cramer: Nasdaq, Goldman Sachs, and Amazon are de-risked IPO plays", "published": "2019-04-02T02:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/10/26/105533095-1540559001478rtx6gfzp.1910x1000.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 767, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 25, "comments": 24, "shares": 23}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f7111beef8bb6c8a35434dd516488b1aeb229705", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/01/cramer-nasdaq-goldman-sachs-and-amazon-are-de-risked-ipo-plays.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tyler Clifford", "published": "2019-04-02T02:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cramer: Nasdaq, Goldman Sachs, and Amazon are de-risked IPO plays", "text": "CNBC's Jim Cramer on Monday said he did not expect Lyft shares to get hit so hard on Monday after their after a positive Friday debut on the stock market.\nThe rideshare app traded as high as $88 a share in its first day, but tumbled nearly 12 percent to settle at $69.01 on Monday. With a load of highly-anticipated companies planning to go public in 2019, he said it's a sign that investors must be very careful buying red-hot initial public offerings. Those include names such as Pinterest, Uber, and Airbnb.\nBut there is a way to make money on the IPO frenzy without buying the new stocks, Cramer said.\n\"If you want to play the IPO boom without taking the immense risk of buying these stocks right out of the gate, embrace the indirect approach and buy the more consistent winners here like Nasdaq, Goldman Sachs and Amazon ,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\nInvest in the exchanges Cramer said investors can buy the stock exchanges that will list the oncoming IPOs. The usual suspects on the U.S. market are the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, he said.\n\"Given where most of these deals are coming, I think Nasdaq 's stock is the way to go,\" Cramer said.\nLevi Strauss went public less than two weeks ago on the NYSE , but was the only new name to list on that market in the first quarter. The Nasdaq brought 17 deals, including Lyft, to market in the first three months of the year, he noted.\nAdditionally, Lyft was the Nasdaq's largest IPO since the faulty debut of Facebook on the tech-focused exchange in 2012. At the time, Facebook's stumble worried many tech companies, which pushed notable names such as Twitter , Alibaba , and Snap Inc. to list on the NYSE, Cramer said.\nUber and Pinterest have also opted for the NYSE, but the host thinks the Nasdaq is in position to land big deals in the future.\n\"Nasdaq delivered 11 percent organic revenue growth, double digit, in its latest quarter. That's a nice acceleration and 21 percent earnings growth,\" Cramer said. \"Plus, with Nasdaq's stock trading at less than 16 times next year's earnings estimates, I think it's a bargain.\"\nUnderwriters The investment banks that underwrite an IPO are well compensated, Cramer said. Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan handled the Levi's and Lyft offerings, respectively, and both firms will play a role in Pinterest's listing this year, he noted.\n\"Goldman Sachs is a pure-play investment bank ... their underwriting business is much more of a needle-mover than JP Morgan ,\" he said. \"They win a bunch of these deals and it will really bolster their earnings power ... The IPO boom could be the catalyst that finally gets this, the cheapest on a price-to-earnings multiple brokerage stock that there is, [moving].\"\nUber is going through its public offering process with Morgan Stanley , which should be a \"lucrative\" deal for the bank, Cramer said.\n\"Again, the financials are an unloved group, but these IPOs give you a reason to bet on the investment banks,\" he said.\nAmazon Amazon doesn't have direct exposure to the IPO market, but there is a high chance that its cloud segment does business with the company that's filing, Cramer said.\nSnap Inc. had $1 billion worth of business with Amazon Web Services at its initial offering, the host said. In Lyft's case, the ride-hailing company will pay the Amazon's cloud arm $300 million over the next three years, he said. While Pinterest is set to pay the company $750 million over a six-year period through 2023, he added.\n\"Amazon Web Services dominates this business. Their next largest competitors, [ Alphabet subsidiary] Google and Microsoft , don't even come close,\" Cramer said. \"So as we see this parade of tech IPOs ... it's telling us how much \u2014 each one of them seems to have a deal with Amazon.\"\nAWS revenue grew 47 percent in 2018.\nWATCH: Cramer explains how investors can make money on IPO season through the side door show chapters Cramer: Nasdaq, Goldman Sachs, and Amazon are de-risked IPO plays 7:00 PM ET Mon, 1 April 2019 | 10:12 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, and JP Morgan.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://instagram.com/jimcramer", "https://twitter.com/MadMoneyOnCNBC", "https://www.facebook.com/madmoney?ref=aymt_homepage_panel", "https://twitter.com/jimcramer"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cramer", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jim cramer", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ipo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pinterest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "airbnb", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T02:27:23.063+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7cbb9750cc134a458271e5019eea955a5aa00cad", "url": "http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201904/02/WS5ca27ce5a3104842260b3c71.html", "site_full": "www.chinadaily.com.cn", "site": "chinadaily.com.cn", "site_section": "http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/", "site_categories": ["media", "travel", "japan"], "section_title": "China Daily Website - Connecting China Connecting the World", "title": "President cites US ties in gathering with ex-leaders - Chinadaily.com.cn", "title_full": "President cites US ties in gathering with ex-leaders - Chinadaily.com.cn", "published": "2019-04-02T00:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201904/02/5ca27ce5a3104842e4a69c84.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 73, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7cbb9750cc134a458271e5019eea955a5aa00cad", "url": "http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201904/02/WS5ca27ce5a3104842260b3c71.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "\u5f90\u9e64", "published": "2019-04-02T00:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "President cites US ties in gathering with ex-leaders - Chinadaily.com.cn", "text": "President Xi Jinping meets a delegation of The Elders at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Monday. Xi told the prominent group, including ex-political leaders from around the world, that China is dedicated to supporting multilateral processes. [Photo by Feng Yongbin/ For China Daily] China would like to walk in the same direction as the United States, handle their disputes and expand cooperation, President Xi Jinping said on Monday.\nXi made the remark while meeting with a delegation of global leaders called The Elders at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. The independent group was founded in 2007 by Nelson Mandela, former president of South Africa.\nXi told the group that Sino-US ties are among the world's most important bilateral relationships. China would like to develop its relations with the US on the basis of coordination, cooperation and stability to provide more certainty and predictability for the world, he added.\nThe relationship between major countries affects the strategic stability of the world, and major countries shoulder special responsibilities, Xi said.\nChina is dedicated to promoting coordination and cooperation between major countries, Xi said, adding that China expects to maintain friendly relations with major countries, avoid conflicts and confrontation, respect each other and cooperate for win-win results.\nXi said the impact of unilateralism has worried many countries, but support for multilateralism remains the mainstream of the international community.\nChina continues to support the multilateral processes including maintaining the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and enhancing the cooperation on climate change, Xi said.\nThe Belt and Road Initiative put forward by China is an important contribution to multilateralism and global cooperation, Xi said, adding that China has worked with other countries to innovate in cooperation in the past five years.\nAs a developing major country, China pursues win-win cooperation and helps all developing nations achieve common development, Xi said, adding that the BRI aims for mutual benefits.\nMost of the members of The Elders are leaders of international organizations and former political leaders including Ban Ki-moon, former secretary-general of the United Nations, and Ernesto Zedillo, former president of Mexico. Its chairwoman is Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland.\nMembers spoke highly of China's achievements in environmental protection, poverty reduction and ethnic relations and development.\nChina has played a constructive role as a responsible major country at a time when multilateralism is facing challenges, and Xi's speeches at international events have sent positive signals, they said.\nNoting that this year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Robinson said that China has made great progress in the recent decades, and she has seen great changes in China.\n\"We hope to really have a continuing dialogue with China on issues because they are quite urgent now,\" she said, adding that multilateralism is \"going through a difficult

Ditto for some refueling infrastructure at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. And funds for improvements at Camp Lejeune, a Marine base still struggling to recover after the damage of Hurricane Florence, are at risk. President Donald Trump wants to fund an expansion of walls on the Mexican border by diverting some $3.6 billion in funds currently slated for United States military construction.\nBut the president\u2019s push raises a question that has deeper resonance here in North Carolina (home to each of the bases mentioned above) and in other conservative-leaning states: What happens when a Republican president borrows money from one national-security effort to finance another one?\nIn the communities surrounding Fort Bragg, views of Mr. Trump\u2019s stratagem are varied. Many worry about shortchanging the needs of U.S. servicemen and women, and their families, or the local economy. Others doubt a border barrier will be effective. But even here, in a place that advertises itself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s most military-friendly state,\u201d views are heavily shaped by opinions about immigration. Many residents interviewed support the president\u2019s move, saying the situation at the U.S. border is now a genuine security crisis.\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing a great job and he better keep it up,\u201d says Charles Hurlburt, a retiree near Fort Bragg who served 23 years in the Army, including during the Vietnam War. Without control of the border, he says, \u201cyou\u2019ll lose control of the country.\u201d\nWill diverting money from military training facilities and children\u2019s schools toward the border reduce national defense readiness? Mr. Hurlburt doesn\u2019t think so, saying \u201cwe never lacked\u201d when he was in the service, and that Mr. Trump \u201chas done a lot for the military.\u201d\nOn immigration, Mr. Hurlburt says more oversight is needed. \u201cThere\u2019s a way to come to this country. And there\u2019s a way not to come to this country.\u201d His wife is from Panama, and he recounts that it was only after several years of marriage that she got citizenship. Given that so many have made lives in the U.S. after arriving illegally, he says those who are law-abiding and pay taxes \u201cought to be moved to the head of the line.\u201d\nBut views on the trade-off of border security versus national security span the map here, as elsewhere, depending in part on whether immigrants are viewed as industrious people fleeing violence and poverty or as free riders who use a porous border to game America\u2019s welfare system.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a waste of money,\u201d says military retiree Charles L. Miller, referring to the border wall. He voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 but, as he stops to run an errand in the town of Spring Lake on the edge of Fort Bragg, he says the president\u2019s emergency declaration is \u201coverstepping his authority.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not that Mr. Miller doesn\u2019t care about a secure border. \u201cI just don\u2019t think the wall is the solution,\u201d he says.\nA few miles away, Jeanine Dodson agrees with Trump\u2019s border-funding plan, and she worries about the cost of immigrants to American taxpayers. As for concerns about cuts to military spending, she figures it\u2019s at most a temporary setback.\n\u201cIf we have border security and we stop feeding billions of dollars to illegals, then it wouldn\u2019t take long\u201d before the government has fresh money available for the military needs, she says.\nAmericans\u2019 diverging views on immigration may be evolving alongside the security situation on the border. Although illegal border crossings are hovering near historic lows , March is on pace for 100,000 apprehensions by border authorities \u2013 the most in any month in more than a decade.\nCustoms and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said last week that a \u201cbreaking point\u201d had arrived . The Border Patrol is struggling with housing those who are apprehended and meeting the health needs of migrants who increasingly are families with children.\nOn Friday, President Trump announced plans to cut off foreign aid for three Central American nations \u2013 Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador \u2013 which are now the leading source of migrants crossing the southern U.S. border. Mr. Trump also threatened a move that would be economically damaging to both the U.S. and Mexico: close the southern U.S. border to trade and travel, unless Mexico does more to stop the immigrant flow.\nMany Americans are concerned about border security, but only 44 percent favor Mr. Trump\u2019s idea of a new border wall, versus 51 percent opposed, according to an early March national poll by Monmouth University. When asked if they supported an emergency declaration so that military funds could be diverted to the border, support fell to 33 percent, versus 65 percent opposed.\nWhile leaning conservative in many ways, North Carolina can be a swing state in presidential elections. Many in this region are more supportive of the armed forces than they are of Mr. Trump. Fort Bragg, near the city of Fayetteville in the center of the state, is the heart of the Army\u2019s airborne and special operations forces. Fayetteville in 2008 began describing itself as a \u201c sanctuary for soldiers ,\u201d signaling its efforts to provide special support to military families.\n\u201cWe like to see our military protected,\u201d says Kerri Ross, a longtime resident. \u201cThey\u2019ll be hurting\u201d because of his plans, she says. \u201cThe housing for our military families is atrocious.\u201d\nPart of a family with deep ties to the armed forces, she worries service members will be shortchanged because, in her view, \u201che wants a Trump Wall as a legacy.\u201d\nAs for the border, \u201cI\u2019ve lived in California and Arizona,\u201d Ms. Ross says. \u201cPeople want in, and they\u2019re going to find a way to get in.\u201d\nIn his latest budget proposal, the president requested $8.6 billion in wall funding. But with little hope of that passing a divided Congress, he has also turned toward the use of military funds. The Department of Defense recently responded with a list of projects that could potentially be postponed, narrowing that list down to $4.3 billion in projects that would avoid cuts to military housing or dormitory improvements.\nStill, many North Carolina civilians worry about the message sent by delaying military projects. \u201cIt\u2019ll hurt us in the long run,\u201d says Martin Lee, a Spring Lake resident who works at a nearby perfume factory. The military budget is \u201csomething he shouldn\u2019t be messing with.\u201d\nBrent Sides, who unlike Mr. Lee was a Trump supporter in 2016, is also wary. On this early spring day, with the warm sun coaxing nearby buds and blossoms to open, Mr. Sides has just finished painting the outlines of some new parking spaces at a Food Lion near Fort Bragg.\nHe laments that Congress and the White House haven\u2019t been able to strike a bargain on immigration and border policies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming to just butting heads,\u201d he says of Washington politics. Although he calls enhanced border security \u201cthe right thing to do,\u201d he says \u201cit\u2019s got to be a good plan.\u201d\nRelated stories\nBriefing Is there a border crisis?

(NASDAQ:AAPL)", "text": "Now that we have entered the second calendar quarter of 2019, investors are looking toward earnings season in a couple of weeks. One of the biggest questions will surround China, as the country has not come to an official trade agreement with the United States just yet. Perhaps the biggest name that has been impacted by this has been technology giant Apple ( AAPL ). The company issued a large revenue warning for its important holiday quarter thanks to weakness in China surrounding iPhone sales, so investors are wondering how quickly the company's second-most-important market can turn.\nOn Monday, it certainly appears that Apple made a move to boost sales. According to multiple reports, the company cut prices on its official China website by as much as 6% for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and AirPods. As CNBC details in this article , the price of the entry-level iPhone XR was lowered by 300RMB to 6,199RMB. The higher-end models of the iPhone saw their prices go down by 500RMB each.\nEarlier this year, consumers in China saw prices cut on official Apple third-party sellers like TMall and JD.com (NASDAQ: JD ). Monday's news comes on the heels of a value-added tax cut in China for manufacturers from 16% to 13%. However, investors also should realize that the US dollar has weakened a bit against the renminbi during the first calendar quarter of Q1 as seen below. The dollar has lost about 2% since the iPhone XR/XS line was announced, and a little more than that from the yearly-high.\n( Source: cnbc.com)\nInterestingly enough, the CNBC article says that anyone who purchased a device in the last 14 days whose price was reduced can receive a refund for the difference. That would imply that Apple management knows its overall revenues for the quarter are decent, because otherwise I don't think they'd potentially refund tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars. This also will mean a slight margin hit for the fiscal second quarter.\nThe big question now is how soon can Apple return to revenue growth in the Greater China region? As the chart below shows, the December period was the worst percentage change in Apple revenues there in the past nine quarters, a decline of almost 26.7%. I don't think anyone is expecting to see growth in the March ending period, but investors and analysts are hopeful that there will be some sequential improvement (not as large a decline).\n( Source: Apple financial information page, seen here )\nAs we look toward earnings season coming in a hurry, Apple made a move Monday to cut prices on its main site in China. While the US trade war has not officially ended, a cut to the value-added tax and weakness in the dollar likely helped Apple pass these savings on to consumers. While it likely will be some time before the company returns to growth in its second-most-important market, management is certainly trying to boost sales in the region. Apple shares are definitely pricing in some good news moving forward, as the stock has recently regained the $190 level for the first time since November.\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.\nAdditional disclosure: Author\u2019s additional disclosure: Investors are always reminded that before making any investment, you should do your own proper due diligence on any name directly or indirectly mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:PII)", "text": "Welcome, reader. In this article, we are going to review the state of Polaris Industries, Inc. (NYSE: PII ) as they are today, following the company's rapid expansion from $1.6B annual sales to their most recent report's $6B sales (Polaris Industries' FY2008 10-K , FY2018 10-K ). Growth has come primarily through acquisition and expansion into the Australian market.\nAfter reviewing the company's financial results, which I outline below, I have to say the company appears to be in good shape. I am bullish Polaris Industries stock as I believe their operating earnings and business position are being undervalued at $84.43.\nPolaris Industries': Activity From The C-Suite The growth through acquisition since 2008 has transformed the state of this business: From carrying no long-term debt outside of their credit facility to issuance of a couple billion in debt of which $1.95B in long-term bonds remains outstanding. The company also operates on a more global scale, coming with the commensurate risks in foreign currency incomes such as from their expansion into Australia.\nReturning to favorable aspects of the business, reviewing the company's reports from both pre and post the great recession indicate a surprisingly resilient sales number. The company made a full 80-90% as many sales or better, taking out revenues acquired during the period, during the recessionary period as they did during the years 2004-2006 and maintained profitable operations to boot.\nThe robust profitability of those lines is a good sign the business will continue generating enough cash to protect shareholder value from negative economic events so long as they do not become much more leveraged. Continuing their streak of strong sales is important here because the company's growth in long-term debt will be a substantial weight on the bottom line until the bonds are retired.\nAll in all, because of the robustness of profits during downturns, so far, their acquisitive behavior is defensible for conservative investors.\nHow Threats To Polaris Have Increased Throughout This Period Of Rapid Growth Inventory turnover has slowed down considerably from typically exceeding 8 turns per year, which the company achieved over many years, to recent reports of a turn rate at 6.6. Adding more high-cost products such as with the company's recently closed acquisition of Boat Holdings, LLC for $805M is likely going to drag their inventory turnover lower.\nThe threat here is, while selling bigger and more expensive items for a healthy profit margin is great (and reduces the turnover number cited above), in the case of an economic slowdown, we're going to see worse performance from the business as credit for big purchases dries up. So, in the case of setbacks, the stock won't be able to avoid being depreciated due to earnings deterioration despite their history of robust earnings.\nPolaris' Top Tier Brands As a result of the Boat acquisition, the company now owns the boating names Bennington, Godfrey, Hurricane, and Rinker. Through this acquisition, Polaris has increased their exposure to the growing popularity of the pontoon boat.\nTheir ATV and Snowmobile businesses are each among, if not the biggest, players in their respective industries. And, the company's Indian Motorcycles brand is legendary among bikers. All in all, the branding picture is good, with Polaris owning top global brands in most of their lines of business.\nMoney Talks: I Am Bullish Polaris Industries Polaris cleared $251M of free cash flow available to owners for 2018 after making their typical volume of capital expenditures. Hence, the maximum dividend distribution they might be able to make at today's earnings, and stock price level attains to a theoretical dividend yield of 4.77%.\nCash from operations came in at $477M during the recent year, about $100M lower than their all-time high takes of 2016 and 2017. The stock is trading at a price to earnings ratio of 16.51x, a 27% discount to the broader market as measured by the S&P 500 and a more modest 9% discount to the DOW Industrials Index at a P/E of 16.99.\nI believe the DOW Industrials is a good comparison because of the large amount of manufacturing operations (reflected in that index's lower P/E). However, I believe Polaris deserves a premium to the DOW P/E because of their strong profit margins and industry-leading position.\nOdds are good we will see the company's cash from operations improve, in part because of the addition of more big-ticket items to their product mix via the Boat purchase. Big ticket durable products tend to generate a lot of cash upfront.\nThe figures are stacking up nicely, with a long track record of successful business operations, the company has built up substantial vertical integration in their product manufacturing process which helps them protect profit margins long term.\nMy take: Polaris is a solid pick for a long-term buy and hold from today's price.\nSupplementary Data: Data by YCharts\nIn the red line, we can see the Polaris has shrunk total shares outstanding by roughly 9% since 2015, making steady progress. Juxtaposed with their share price, it appears management has been chasing the stock price up on these purchases, which is unfavorable for long-term shareholders.\nThe company is in the first innings of its second decade as a leveraged corporate. At 33% debt to revenue, the company is soundly positioned, and as an investor, I'd like to see them accumulating cash while maintaining the dividend and deploying a small portion of cash to buy back stock below $100 per share.\nLove the message?

Uber and Pinterest have also selected the NYSE for their initial public offerings, according to multiple reports . Lyft ( LYFT ), which saw shares begin trading Friday, selected the Nasdaq.\nSlack declined to comment on the report.\nIn February, the San Francisco, California-based company announced that it had confidentially filed to go public and offer shares of its Class A common stock.\nIn a direct listing, a company avoids using underwriters and instead sells shares directly to the public. The process allows companies to avoid a lock-up period on selling shares, and also does not involve a pre-public capital raise for the company, as with a typical IPO.\nSlack is still working with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding listing logistics and is not expected to go public until at least June or July, the WSJ report added.\nThis comes following Spotify\u2019s ( SPOT ) decision to debut on the NYSE via direct listing last year. Spotify\u2019s market capitalization has now topped $25 billion, and shares have risen 6% since hitting the public markets last April.\nSlack was last valued privately at more than $7 billion.\n\u2014\nEmily McCormick is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

U.S. stocks rallied on Monday, starting off the second quarter on a strong note, as upbeat manufacturing numbers from China and the United States eased worries about slowing global growth.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 index, which is only 2.2 percent below its record closing high in September, triggered a \"golden cross\" pattern, in which its 50-day moving average crosses above its 200-day moving average. Many believe the technical signal could portend more gains for stocks in the short term.\nGains in global equities were spurred by data showing that China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly returned to growth in March for the first time in four months.\n\"The Chinese numbers bounced back, and people are taking more risk today because of it,\" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.\nU.S. manufacturing numbers for March were also better than expected, helping investors overlook soft retail sales data for February.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 329.74 points, or 1.27 percent, to 26,258.42, the S&P 500 gained 32.79 points, or 1.16 percent, to 2,867.19, and the Nasdaq Composite added 99.59 points, or 1.29 percent, to 7,828.91.\nConcerns about a global economic slowdown have dimmed sentiment since the Federal Reserve announced in late January that its monetary tightening would end earlier than expected, as it cited \"cross currents\" affecting the economy. The shift in Fed policy drove yields on 10-year Treasury notes below those of three-month bills last week for the first time in more than a decade.\nYields on 10-year notes have since risen back above three-month bill rates and on Monday hit a one-week high. Monday's rise in the 10-year Treasury yield helped lift financial shares, which provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500 among the index's 11 sectors. S&P 500 bank shares jumped 2.9 percent.\n\"Treasury yields had priced in a gloomy outlook, and now they're unwinding some of that negativity,\" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. \"So we're seeing money moving back into cyclical areas, which is why financials are big leaders today.\"\nConcerns about slowing momentum have not entirely dissipated. With the first-quarter corporate earnings reporting season about two weeks away, investors are bracing for what may be the first U.S. profit decline since 2016. Analysts expect quarterly earnings to fall 2 percent, according to Refinitiv data.\nStill, on Monday, most S&P sectors rose. Only consumer staples, real estate and utilities shares, which tend to decline as 10-year Treasury yields rise, were in the red.\nAuto shares rose after China's State Council said on Sunday that the country would continue to suspend additional tariffs on import of U.S. vehicles and auto parts after April 1.\nGeneral Motors Co shares added 1.8 percent and Ford Motor Co shares gained 2.3 percent.\nChipmakers, which draw much of their revenue from China, also rose.

Many believe the technical signal could portend more gains for stocks in the short term.\nSpurring gains in global equities, China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly returned to growth for the first time in four months in March.\n\"The Chinese numbers bounced back, and people are taking more risk today because of it,\" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.\nU.S. manufacturing numbers also came in better-than-expected in March, helping investors overlook soft retail sales data for February.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 280.59 points, or 1.08 percent, to 26,209.27, the S&P 500 gained 27.83 points, or 0.98 percent, to 2,862.23 and the Nasdaq Composite added 89.08 points, or 1.15 percent, to 7,818.40.\nConcerns about a global economic slowdown had come to the fore after the Federal Reserve announced that its monetary tightening policy cycle would end earlier than expected. The shift in Fed policy drove yields on 10-year Treasury notes below those of three-month bills last week for the first time in more than a decade.\nYields on 10-year notes have since risen back above three-month bill rates and on Monday hit a one-week high. The rise in 10-year Treasury yields helped lift financial shares , which provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500 among the index's 11 sectors. S&P 500 bank shares jumped 2.6 percent.\nConcerns about slowing momentum have not entirely dissipated. With the first-quarter earnings season about two weeks away, investors are bracing for what may be the first U.S. profit decline since 2016. Analysts expect quarterly earnings to fall 2 percent, according to Refinitiv data.\nStill, on Monday, most S&P sectors posted gains. Only consumer staples, real estate and utilities shares, which tend to decline as 10-year Treasury yields rise, were in the red.\nAuto shares rose after China's State Council said on Sunday that the country would continue to suspend additional tariffs on U.S. vehicles and auto parts after April 1.\nGeneral Motors Co shares rose 1.5 percent and Ford Motor Co shares gained 2.2 percent.\nChipmakers, which get a large part of revenue from China, also rose. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index added 2.4 percent.\nShares of Wynn Resorts Ltd jumped 7.8 percent, the most among S&P companies, as March gambling revenue from the Chinese territory of Macau rose from the previous month.\nLyft Inc shares tumbled 11.5 percent as brokerage Guggenheim Securities started coverage of the ride-hailing start-up's shares with a 'neutral' rating. The company debuted on the Nasdaq on Friday.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.66-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.99-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nThe S&P 500 posted 60 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 64 new highs and 28 new lows.

(AFP/Hennepin County Sheriff's Office)\nThe 40-year-old yoga instructor had approached the cruiser after calling twice to report a possible rape in the dark alley behind her home.\nThe Australian, whose maiden name was Ruszczyk, had moved to the US to marry her fiancee Don Damond.\nShe was shot once in the abdomen and died at the scene.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Damond's killing sparked outrage in Minneapolis and her native country, which since has translated to intense interest in the case as it moves to trial.\nControversial police shooting cases in the US have proven difficult to prosecute, however, with few officers sent to prison.\nOutside the courthouse on Monday, a spokeswoman from the organisation \"Justice for Justine\" called for accountability.\n\"Systemic issues extend far beyond this one shooting, this one officer, this one trial,\" Katherine Hamburg told reporters.\n\"The fight for justice must continue until the institutions and cultures that shield police from accountability are dismantled.\"\nDozens of prospective jurors were given initial instructions on Monday and handed questionnaires. Court proceedings ended by late morning and were scheduled to resume on Wednesday.\nProspective jurors were to turn in written answers to 66 questions, including whether they owned firearms or knew anyone of Somali decent.\nProsecutors also filed a nine-page list of potential witnesses that included Matthew Harrity, Noor's partner on the night of the shooting.\nNOOR'S WORK HISTORY BARRED\nNoor was fired from the police force after the incident and charged with second-degree and third-degree murder, as well as second-degree manslaughter.\nHe has pleaded not guilty.\nThe murder charges carry sentences of up to 25 years for the second-degree charge and up to 10 years for the third-degree count.\nThe prosecution has claimed Noor acted unreasonably - shooting at someone he did not clearly see while his partner was in the line of fire.\nNoor's attorneys have indicated they plan to mount a self-defence argument. Attorney Tom Plunkett has said his client \"acted as he has been trained and consistent with established departmental policy.\"\nMinnesota Public Radio said Noor was deemed \"asocial and socially introverted\" in his pre-employment psychological test, but that there were no signs of disqualifying mental illness.\nPolice officers involved in controversial shootings are rarely sent to prison, because juries and judges are loath to second guess officers' split-second, life-or-death decisions.\nTrials have mostly resulted in hung juries or acquittals, which at times have caused civil unrest in American cities where racial tensions are already high.\nThe Damond shooting enraged many of the victim's neighbours, who mounted a campaign for police reforms. The city's police chief at the time was forced to resign within days.\nAnother Minnesota officer, Jeronimo Yanez, was sacked but acquitted after fatally shooting black motorist Philando Castile in 2016.\nThere were several days of protests in another Midwestern city - Saint Louis, Missouri - in 2017, after a judge concluded there was not enough evidence to convict former officer Jason Stockley for shooting Anthony Lamar Smith after a 2011 car chase.\nIn Chicago, Jason Van Dyke, who is white, was convicted of the 2014 murder of black teen Laquan McDonald. The 17-year-old was shot 16 times by the former officer, with most of those bullets striking the teen after he fell to the ground.\nSource: AFP/de", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "justine damond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "damond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "don damond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohamed noor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruszczyk", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "afp/hennepin county sheriff's office", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minneapolis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "midwestern", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T02:35:35.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b07e309813d94de91f2ef708a0d73e27a9be79f9", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/boeing-must-do-more-work-737-max-fix-us-regulator-faa-11402640", "site_full": "www.channelnewsasia.com", "site": "channelnewsasia.com", "site_section": "http://flip.channelnewsasia.com/main.xml", "site_categories": ["society", "tech"], "section_title": "Channel NewsAsia", "title": "Boeing must do more work on proposed 737 MAX fix: US regulator", "title_full": "Boeing must do more work on proposed 737 MAX fix: US regulator", "published": "2019-04-02T00:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/11402564/16x9/991/557/4706a2893d382dd2d7c4d7b3fd739ceb/HK/file-photo--a-boeing-737-max-8-takes-off-during-a-flight-test-in-renton--washington-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6036, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 101, "comments": 22, "shares": 31}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b07e309813d94de91f2ef708a0d73e27a9be79f9", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/boeing-must-do-more-work-737-max-fix-us-regulator-faa-11402640", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T00:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Boeing must do more work on proposed 737 MAX fix: US regulator", "text": "\nNEW YORK: Boeing must perform more work on its proposed fix to 737 MAX aircraft before it can be submitted for review, US officials said on Monday (Apr 1), suggesting the planes could stay grounded a while longer.\nAdditional work is needed \"to ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues,\" a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said in a statement. Advertisement\n\"The FAA will not approve the software for installation until the agency is satisfied with the submission,\" he added.\nThe FAA statement is the bureaucratic equivalent of a \"stop\" sign after Boeing officials touted their proposed remedy last week during a media tour at the company's manufacturing plant in Seattle, Washington.\nBoeing's 737 MAX planes were grounded globally last month following the second of two deadly crashes to occur in less than five months.\nScrutiny has centred on an anti-stall system developed specifically for the planes that has given pilots problems. Advertisement Advertisement\nA preliminary report into the second calamity - the Mar 10 crash of a Boeing 737 MAX 8 that killed 157 people - will likely be issued this week, the Ethiopian government said on Monday.\nBoeing last week gathered hundreds of pilots and reporters at its Renton, Washington manufacturing site for a presentation on proposed changes to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which is believed to have been a key factor in the Ethiopian crash and in an October crash of a Lion Air in Indonesia that killed 189 people.\nAmong the changes, the MCAS will no longer repeatedly make corrections when the pilot tries to regain control, and will automatically disconnect in the event of disagreements between the two \"angle of attack,\" or AOA sensors, the company said last week.\nBoeing is anxious to win approval for a proposed remedy that could get the planes back in the air.\nBut the FAA, which faced harsh questioning last week at a congressional hearing regarding its oversight of Boeing, said it expected Boeing to submit the proposed fix \"over the coming weeks\" after it undertakes additional work.\nAfter that, the proposal will be submitted to a \"rigorous safety review,\" the FAA spokesman said.\nA Boeing spokesman said on Monday the company was continuing to work with regulators to address concerns.\n\"We are working to demonstrate that we have identified and appropriately addressed all certification requirements and will be submitting for FAA review once completed in the coming weeks,\" the Boeing spokesman said.\n\"Safety is our first priority and we will take a thorough and methodical approach to the development and testing of the update to ensure we take the time to get it right.\"\nPRELIMINARY REPORT THIS WEEK\nEarlier on Monday, Ethiopian foreign ministry spokesman Nebiat Getachew said the transport ministry would release \"a preliminary report into its investigation\" of the Mar 10 accident in which a Nairobi-bound Boeing 737 MAX crashed shortly after taking off from Addis Ababa.\nThe Ethiopian government gave no details on the exact timing of the release, nor hints about the report's findings.\nNebiat initially said the report would be released on Monday but the transport ministry, which is in charge of investigations, later said it would still be some days.\n\"The report will most likely be released some day later this week,\" ministry spokesman Mussie Yiheyes said.\nIt was not clear on Monday if the transport ministry's preliminary report would be made public straight away, or limited to the eyes of authorities including the FAA.\nThe plane's black boxes are being examined by France's BEA air safety agency, working with American and Ethiopian investigators to determine what went wrong.\nANTI-STALL SYSTEM\nA source with knowledge of the investigation has said an anti-stalling system, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), was activated shortly before the crash.\nBoeing designed the automated MCAS system - which lowers the aircraft's nose if it detects a stall or loss of airspeed - for this particular model.\nThe same system was implicated in the October crash, with initial investigations finding that a sensor on the plane had transmitted incorrect information to the MCAS system.\nThe pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 struggled to control the aircraft as the MCAS repeatedly pushed the plane's nose down, according to the flight data recorder.\nThe pilot had tried repeatedly to regain control and pull the nose up but the plane crashed into the sea.\nBoth the planes in Indonesia and Ethiopia reportedly experienced erratic steep climbs and descents, as well as fluctuating airspeeds, before crashing shortly after takeoff.\nEthiopia has already said there were \"clear similarities\" between the two MAX 8 crashes.\nEthiopian Airlines is Africa's largest carrier and in many ways the international face of the nation.

World | Agence France-Presse | Updated: April 02, 2019 04:47 IST Share PRINT COMMENTS \"Should Turkey procure the S-400, their continued participation in F-35 program is at risk,\" US official Washington:\nThe United States said on Monday it was halting all deliveries and joint work with Turkey on the F-35 fighter jet program after the NATO ally insisted on a major arms purchase from Russia.\nAfter months of warnings, the United States said that Turkey's decision to buy Russia's S-400 missile system was incompatible with remaining part of the emblematic US warplane program.\n\"Until they forgo delivery of the S-400, the United States has suspended deliveries and activities associated with the stand-up of Turkey's F-35 operational capability ,\" Pentagon chief spokesman Charles E. Summers Jr. said.\n\"Should Turkey procure the S-400, their continued participation in the F-35 program is at risk,\" he said in a statement.\nUS officials have voiced concern that, with Turkey in both camps, Russia could obtain F-35 data to improve the accuracy of the S-400 against Western aircraft.\nThe Pentagon said that it had started to look at secondary sources to produce parts for F-35s that were being developed in Turkey.\n\"We very much regret the current situation facing our F-35 partnership with Turkey, but the (Defense Department) is taking prudent steps to protect the shared investments made in our critical technology,\" Summers said.\nTurkey had planned to buy 100 F-35A fighter jets, with pilots already training in the United States. The plane's manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, said that contracts with Turkish companies to build parts for the F-35 had been expected to reach $12 billion.\nAmong the eight Turkish companies involved in the purchase, Ayesas has been building a panoramic cockpit display for the F-35 and Fokker Elmo makes 40 percent of the electrical wiring and interconnection system, according to Lockheed Martin.\nGrowing tilt to Russia\nThe purchase of a Russian system is highly unusual for a member of NATO, the Western alliance forged to counter the Soviet Union.\nThe US suspension announcement comes two days before foreign ministers from the 29 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are due in Washington to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the alliance -- and hours after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's AKP party suffered a surprise rout in elections in major cities including Istanbul.\nErdogan, whose relations with the West have soured sharply as he cracks down on dissent at home, has increasingly looked to Moscow as a partner. Russian tourists have made Turkey their top destination, providing a vital economic boost.\nLast week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov traveled to Turkey, where Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu insisted that the S-400 purchase would go ahead.\n\"We have an agreement with Russia and we are bound by it,\" Cavusoglu told reporters.\nHoping to offer an alternative, the United States last year approved the sale of Patriot missiles to Turkey -- a deal to which Ankara said it was open.\nFour senators last week proposed legally barring the transfer of F-35s to Turkey if it buys the S-400. One of the senators, Democrat Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, praised the Pentagon suspension and pledged to \"continue working in the Senate to prevent this dangerous possibility from becoming a reality.\"\nRocky ties with US\nTurkey's relations with the United States plunged last year when President Donald Trump imposed tariffs, battering Turkey's lira, over the jailing of an American pastor detained as part of a mass roundup following a coup attempt against Erdogan.\nThe pastor, Andrew Brunson, was freed and Trump appeared to grow fond of Erdogan, speaking to him before his sudden decision to withdrew US troops from Syria.\nBut tensions quickly resurfaced with the United States fearful that Erdogan will strike US-allied Kurdish fighters in Syria and a Turkish court trying a US consulate staffer, Metin Topuz, on charges of spying.\nTopuz, a Turkish citizen, is accused of ties to Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish preacher who lives in self-imposed exile in the United States. Erdogan has repeatedly demanded that the United States extradite Gulen, whom the Turkish leader accuses of fomenting the coup.

Many investors who did not know how to hedge their cryptocurrency investments saw these investments lose value from the market highs of 2017. Facing the deadline to report their taxes by April 15, 2019, United States individual taxpayers may wonder what their United States tax reporting obligations are if they held, donated or sold/exchanged their cryptocurrencies at a loss during 2018. A taxpayer\u2019s dilemma Let's imagine a potential 2019 taxpayer sitting in front of his tax advisor and feeling embarrassed to tell him that he had lost 90 percent of a 100K investment in cryptocurrencies when the cryptocurrency markets experienced a downturn during 2018, with leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) down 80 percent or more. The taxpayer invested heavily into crypto at the end of 2017 and beginning of 2018 \u2014 which he said he regretted everyday since then, because he lost almost all of it. The tax advisor assured the taxpayer that this would give rise to a taxable event only if he sold, exchanged or donated his cryptocurrency during 2018, and that these things would need to be reported on his U.S. tax return \u2014 noting, however, that holding cryptocurrencies would not give rise to a taxable event but may give rise to tax-reporting requirements if the cryptocurrencies were held in a foreign financial account. Cryptocurrency hodlers If a taxpayer for 2018 has not sold, exchanged or donated the cryptocurrency he bought at the end of 2017 or beginning of 2018 and is still holding them, then there is no taxable event to report on his U.S. tax return. Tax-reporting requirements would arise if the taxpayer held these cryptocurrencies in a foreign financial account and if mandatory financial thresholds were met under Foreign Bank Account Report (FBAR) and Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) reporting requirements, according to a letter from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) to the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ). FBAR : A taxpayer with a financial interest in or signatory authority over a foreign financial account must file a foreign bank account report (FBAR) FinCEN Form 114 if the aggregate value of the foreign financial account exceeds $10,000 at any time during the calendar year. Noncompliance with FBAR would subject a taxpayer to steep civil and criminal penalties. Each nonwillful failure to file violation can carry a civil penalty of $10,000. Penalties for each willful violation could be the greater of $100,000 or 50 percent of the amount in the account. FATCA : A taxpayer with foreign financial assets of $50,000 or more must report it for FATCA purposes on Form 8938 . It is recommended that cryptocurrency-invested hedge fund accounts and cryptocurrency-denominated exchange accounts be reported in the summary information in Part I of Form 8938. Specific information should be given in Part V. Noncompliance with FATCA could subject a taxpayer to taxes, severe penalties in excess of the unreported foreign assets, and exclusion from access to U.S. markets, which could include a regulated cryptocurrency derivatives clearing market. Cryptocurrency charitable donations A taxpayer may feel generous and decide to donate their cryptocurrencies to a tax code Section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt charity of their choice, to give the charity a large gift. Since a cryptocurrency is considered property for U.S. tax purposes , it will be valued at the time of donation at its fair market value. Donors of cryptocurrencies of over $500 \u2014 which are noncash donations \u2014 will be required to comply with IRS appraisal requirements by filing Form 8283 . The donation will be tax deductible for the U.S. individual donor as follows: If the donor held the cryptocurrency as a capital asset for more than a year, the donor will be able to deduct the fair market value of the gift up to 30 percent of their adjusted gross income (AGI). If the donor held the cryptocurrency as a capital asset for a short term (i.e., less than one year) or as ordinary income property, the donor will be able to deduct the lesser of cost basis or fair market value up to 50 percent of their AGI. If the donor received the cryptocurrency as payment for services rendered, the donor may claim a deduction of the fair market value on the date of receipt. Charitable contributions that are not deductible in the current year, because they exceed the taxpayer\u2019s AGI limitation, can be carried forward for five years. Cryptocurrency investment sold or exchanged at a loss If a taxpayer held the cryptocurrency as an investment and sold it during 2018, he will be taxed just like bonds or stocks at capital gains rate, which is calculated by subtracting the cost of the asset at the time of purchase from the amount at which it was sold. That difference is typically levied at between 15 percent and 20 percent for long-term investments, held for over a year, or at short-term rates, ranging from 10 percent to 37 percent. If the taxpayer is in the three highest income brackets, he may also have to pay a 3.8 percent tax on the net investment income from short-term investments, held for less than a year. A taxpayer can use his cryptocurrency investment capital losses to offset gains and deduct the difference on his tax return, up to $3,000 per year. Cryptocurrency software services such as Bitcoin.tax or Cointracking.info may ease the calculation of cryptocurrency investment gains and losses that are reported on Form 8949 , which then becomes part of a taxpayer\u2019s Form 1040 Schedule D . Any portion of a capital loss that exceeds the $3,000 annual deduction limit may be carried forward, but not carried back. According to a survey prepared by personal finance company Credit Karma, only around half of cryptocurrency investors who lost $1.7 billion during 2018 plan to report their losses to the IRS. Their reasons for staying quiet is partially tied to not knowing if they can deduct their losses, believing they don't have to, or that they neglected to report cryptocurrency gains in past years and now are afraid to report their cryptocurrency losses. However, taxpayers who have neglected to pay their cryptocurrency-related U.S. taxes and who file their applicable U.S. tax returns should do so by April 15, 2019 to avoid interest, penalties, and even jail time for tax evasion or, worse, for tax fraud, since \u201ccryptocurrencies are a key part of the Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement\u2019s work,\u201d Don Fort, chief of the Criminal Investigation Department at the IRS said at a Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement meeting in Amsterdam, citing the risk that such coins are used in the U.S. to avoid paying taxes.

the infection and \"complications from influenza B.\"\nThe New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator said Monday that the report is still open and has not been finalized.\nThe office previously

They were detained the same day.\nThe father has said that the boy was in good health when they were taken into custody. But days later he had flu symptoms and was brought to a hospital, where he died.\nAn autopsy released Friday on the other child, 7-year-old Jakelin Caal Maquin, found that her death Dec. 8 was also due to bacterial infection.\nThat report found bacteria in her lungs, liver, spleen and adrenal glands and said she suffered a rapid, progressive infection that led to multiple organ failure.\nJohana Samayoa, chief of chronic infections at the Roosevelt Hospital in Guatemala, said these kinds of infections typically have an incubation period of eight days and can be deadly if not treated, especially in combination with other factors such as malnutrition.

AU 10yr yields moved almost 6bp to 1.87%, while 3yr yields added 3.5bp to reach 1.405% \u2013 steepening the curve to 46.5bp. While mirroring UST price action, AU 10yr found some support ahead of today\u2019s Federal Budget and the AU-US 10yr spread narrowed to -63.3bp. Ahead of today\u2019s RBA meeting, the market is pricing 96% chance of a cut in August with a \u2018terminal rate\u2019 of 1.04% reached by June next year.\nWhile welcome prints of China\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) pleased the Aussie buyers at the week-start, they failed to sustain the gains as traders preferred the US Dollar after upbeat ISM manufacturing PMI signaled fewer chances of the US recession.\nLooking forward, monetary policy meeting by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) gains immediate attention of the AUD/USD pair\u2019s traders. The Australian central bank is less likely to offer any change in its present monetary policy with 1.5% cash rate while expectedly offering a neutral policy bias. However, some at the desks expect recent recovery in China data and likely chances of the US-China trade deal playing their part to push the RBA policymakers towards a bit hawkish statement.\nIt should also be observed that February month Australian building permits could offer intermediate moves ahead of the RBA. The housing market indicator is likely to have slipped by -1.0% compared to +2.5% previous growth on a monthly basis.\nOn the other hand, the US Durable goods orders for February will entertain AUD/USD traders after the RBA meeting. The order growth may contract to -1.8% from the previously revised figure of +0.3% whereas the Non-defense capital goods orders ex-aircraft may stall around 0.0% from +0.8% prior.\nAUD/USD Technical Analysis\nNot only a daily close beyond 50-day SMA level of 0.7120 but a successful break of 0.7155 resistance-confluence comprising 100-day SMA and a six-week-old descending trend-line could also challenge Aussie buyers.\nOn the downside, 50% Fibonacci retracement of December 2018 to January 2019 decline, at 0.7060, could offer strong support to the pair during its drop, failing to which highlights 0.7000 and 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of 0.6980 as crucial levels to watch.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Sophie Mayanne 11 Sun Online columnist Deborah James bares all as she stars in a hard-hitting photoshoot proving bowel cancer can affect anyone\nNow, a brave group of patients and relatives have shared their experiences of the disease - and bared all for the camera - to highlight how it can affect anyone, at any time in life.\nThe photos, taken by acclaimed photographer Sophie Mayanne, are released today by Bowel Cancer UK as part of their #thisisbowelcancer campaign to mark Bowel Cancer Awareness Month.\nIt comes after BBC journalist Jeremy Bowen revealed yesterday he is being treated for the disease , at the age of 59.\nBowel cancer is more common in those aged 50 and over. But, many of those pictured were diagnosed in their 30s.\nThat's why The Sun launched the No Time 2 Lose campaign last year - to raise awareness and encourage everyone no matter their age to learn the signs and symptoms of the disease.\nOur campaign was spearheaded by Sun Online columnist Deborah James, who is photographed alongside friends in treatment, patients in remission and relatives who have lost ones.\nHere they tell The Sun how they represent what bowel cancer is. Sun Online columnist Deborah James, 37: 'I was 35... you're never too young' Sophie Mayanne 11 Deborah was 35 when she was diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer\nDeborah, 37, who shares her experience in her weekly column Things Cancer Made Me Say , is being treated for stage 4 bowel cancer, said: \u201cBowel cancer can happen to anyone of us.\n\"Any age, race - you are never too young, too fit or too healthy. It tears lives apart.\n\"It's not just something that affects older people, I was 35 when I was diagnosed and my world came crashing down.\n\"I've lost friends to this horrible disease, and I have to face the reality that it's likely to rob me of my future, my kids of their mum.\n\"Together, by raising awareness and breaking taboos, we can stop other people dying of bowel cancer.\n\"This disease doesn't have to be a death sentence, catch it early enough and chances are, you will survive.\" Richard Bingham, 40: 'I look entirely normal but stage 4 cancer is on the rampage inside' Sophie Mayanne Richard Bingham was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer when he was in his 30s Photographer's granddad had bowel cancer\nTHE powerful images were taken by acclaimed photographer Sophie Mayanne, whose grandfather was diagnosed with bowel cancer.\nShe said: \"My granddad had bowel cancer in his final years, so it is a topic that hits close to home for me.\n\"It's important to show the different angles of living with cancer - as each person's journey is as unique, as it is emotional.\n\"I think the most important thing people can take away from these images is that life doesn't stop when you are diagnosed with cancer.\n\"My granddad was still my granddad when he was diagnosed, as are mothers still mothers, partners still partners and family still family.\u201d\nRichard Bingham, 40, from East Sussex was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer in 2016.\nHe lives in Rye with his partner Bekky (also featured in the portrait series).\nSince his diagnosis he has undergone bowel and liver surgery, radiotherapy and is currently having chemotherapy.\nHe said: \u201cBowel cancer - indeed any cancer - is so often unseen, with the patient appearing entirely normal while the disease is on the rampage on the inside.\n\"It comes in so many different shapes and forms that it is vital people understand this, especially to allow for early diagnosis.\n\"The photo shoot was an amazing experience, which left both Bekky and I feeling emotional, part of a community and privileged to be involved in such an awesome and meaningful campaign.\" Katy Bruce Jaja, 34: 'Pregnancy masked my disease, being young doesn't mean you're immune' Sophie Mayanne 11 Katy Bruce Jaja, with her two children, said her symptoms were missed during pregnancy with her youngest son - she's just 34\nKaty Bruce Jaja, 34 from Essex was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer six months ago in 2018, after her symptoms were missed whilst she was pregnant with her youngest son.\nKaty is married and a mum of two boys. She is currently in treatment and has just finished chemotherapy.\nShe said: \u201cMy life completely changed a few months ago. Bowel cancer was not something that I ever thought about.\n\"As a young woman I was aware of things like breast and cervical cancer checks but I always associated bowel cancer with being a lot older.\n\"I\u2019m 34. Unfortunately being young doesn\u2019t make you immune.\n\"More awareness needs to be raised. If you\u2019re experiencing symptoms go to see your GP, the earlier the better!\u201d Barbara Hibbert, 61: 'Stage 4 doesn't mean you have to stop living' Sophie Mayanne Former teacher Barbara Hibbert, 61 from Harrogate was diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer in 2014\nBarbara Hibbert, 61 from Harrogate was diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer in 2014.\nA former teacher she is a mother to two daughters and a grandmother.\nBarbara has undergone bowel surgery and lost her hair as a result of chemotherapy, which is quite rare for people with bowel cancer.\nShe said: \u2018\u2018I want to show that a stage 4, doesn\u2019t mean that you stop living \u2013 you just have to live faster because you have less time. Bowel cancer touches millions across UK - charity boss\nDEBORAH Alsina, chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK said: \u201cThese incredible images and raw footage are a beautiful homage to those affected by bowel cancer.\n\"Young, old, female or male \u2013 it can affect us all.\n\"Around 268,000 people living in the UK today have been diagnosed with bowel cancer.\n\"But it doesn\u2019t just impact the person with the disease.\n\"It touches their families, friends and colleagues, doctors and nurses, scientists and researchers.\n\"That\u2019s millions of people right across the UK.\n\"We need more people affected by bowel cancer to come together and take action to create a future where nobody dies of this disease.\u201d\n\"A terminal diagnosis isn\u2019t a good thing to receive, but it does give you time to prepare and to make the most of the time you have left.\n\u201cI put off getting my symptoms checked and that delay meant that when my cancer was found it was already severe.\n\"It\u2019s very easy to persuade yourself that you shouldn\u2019t bother the busy doctor or be one of the \u2018worried well\u2019 clogging up the surgery, but it\u2019s so important to get yourself checked, even if you are overweight, drink too much, don\u2019t take much exercise and are menopausal \u2013 all excuses for not taking action in my case. Margaret Chung, 66: 'My daughter was 36, she died seven months after diagnosis' Sophie Mayanne 11 Margaret Chung holds a picture of her daughter Annabel who died within seven months of being diagnosed\nMargaret Chung, 66 from Buckinghamshire lost her daughter Annabel to bowel cancer in 2016 at just 36, seven months after she was diagnosed with the disease.\nShe said: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a word in the dictionary that can express just how awful it was to lose Annabel.\n\"Especially knowing that if her symptoms had been taken seriously earlier, she might still be with us.\n\"When she was here Annabel touched so many people\u2019s lives so knowing that through this, she has contributed and is still helping people, is a life saver for me.\"I just wish she was here.\u201d Gemma Savoury, 34: 'Bowel cancer is indiscriminate' Sophie Mayanne 11 Gemma Savoury shows her permanent stoma bag after being diagnosed wit stage four bowel cancer\nGemma Savoury, 34, from West Midlands was initially diagnosed with stage three bowel cancer in 2014, but unfortunately three years later it spread to her lungs.\nSince being diagnosed she has had chemotherapy, lung surgery, abdominoperineal resection surgery and now has a permanent stoma bag and is on dialysis.\nShe said: \u201cIt\u2019s really important to show that anyone, at any age can be affected by bowel cancer.\n\"Cancer doesn\u2019t pick an age, colour or gender, it\u2019s indiscriminate and it is life-changing.\n\"This shoot gave me the opportunity to embrace my scars, gain some much needed confidence and feel proud of how far I\u2019ve come.\" The Sun's No Time 2 Lose campaign\nTHE Sun's No Time 2 Lose campaign called for bowel cancer screening in England to be lowered from 60 to 50, which experts say could save more than 4,500 lives a year.\nIn Scotland, NHS patients can take a Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) from their 50th birthday but the rest of the UK have to wait another 10 years.\nAn independent review of national screening programmes is currently underway, according to NHS England.\nBut as these brave people have shown, bowel cancer can affect anyone at any age.\nIt is the second deadliest form of the disease, but it can be cured if it's caught early - or better still prevented.\nCaught at stage 1 - the earliest stage - patients have a 97 per cent chance of living for five years or longer.\nBut catch it at stage 4 - when it's already spread - and that chance plummets to just seven per cent.\nWe all deserve an equal chance to beat this disease, regardless of where we live.\nWe know bowel cancer is more likely after the age of 50 - so it makes sense to screen from then.\nPlus, it's got to save the NHS money in the long-run, catching the disease before patients need serious and expensive treatments. Reginald Bull, 84: 'I'm proof if you catch it early you can survive this' Sophie Mayanne Reginald Bull, 84, from Hampshire was diagnosed with stage one bowel cancer when he was 53\nReginald Bull, 84, from Hampshire was diagnosed with stage one bowel cancer when he was 53.\nThough he was given the all clear, the fear of the cancer coming back and the trauma he went through left him with chronic depression.\nWith the support of his wife, Maureen, Reginald sought help and is a stronger person.\nHe said: \"Taking part made me feel that in some small way I might help others who one day may have to face all the traumas associated with being diagnosed with bowel cancer and for that I am very grateful.\" Jaimin Patel, 35: 'I'm stage 3, but it doesn't mean life is over' Sophie Mayanne 11 Jaimin Patel, 35, has incurable bowel cancer\nJaimin Patel, 35, from London was diagnosed with stage three bowel cancer in 2013 - three years later he found out it was incurable.\nJaimin is married with a young son and has a stoma following bowel surgery.\nHe said: \u201cI want people to see that although I might be young(ish), having bowel cancer doesn\u2019t mean that life is over.\n\"I hope that getting the picture of normality out to those suffering with this cancer will encourage them to try different things and not feel restricted in their life.\n\"Because if I can lead as normal a life as possible, by being positive and trying new things, you can give yourself a better chance of making the most of the time you are living and not worry about the time after.\u201d Seraphine Uwimana, 49: 'This disease took my husband, don't let it take yours' Sophie Mayanne Seraphine Uwimana, 49, lost her husband, Antoine, to bowel cancer - pictured with her daughter and grandson\nSeraphine Uwimana, 49 from London lost her husband, Antoine, in 2016 after he died from bowel cancer.\nThe couple had been together for 26 years and had three children together.\nShe said: \u201cWhat I wish, is that if anyone has those symptoms then they go to the doctor as soon as they see them.\n\"Antoine didn\u2019t and maybe if he did, they would have caught it sooner and he would still be here now.\n\"The thing I found hardest about losing Antoine wasn\u2019t losing my husband, it was losing my councillor, adviser and best friend.\n\"I don\u2019t want anyone else to go through that.\u201d Stuart Cock, 44: 'I want my kids to grow up in a world where no one dies from this disease' Sophie Mayanne Dad-of-four Stuart Cock was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2017 THERE'S NO TIME 2 LOSE WISE UP 1 in 3 Brits clueless about bowel cancer symptoms - know the signs to watch out for BOWEN'S BATTLE BBC newsreader Jeremy Bowen, 59, reveals he has bowel cancer Exclusive INCURABLE Mum told she's too young for cancer rushed to A&E with 'tumour poking out of bum' tackled from behind Footie star's funny account of 'camera 12,000ft up bum' for cancer test LIFE SAVER Mum suffering anal cancer tells Lorraine The Sun's Deborah James saved her life Revealed The five red flag warning signs of bowel cancer you should NEVER ignore Revealed More young people are getting bowel cancer - do you know 5 red-flag signs?

Closing the border would potentially disrupt millions of legal border crossings and billions of dollars in trade.\nOne policy put in place earlier this year to return asylum seekers to Mexico, dubbed the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), will be \"immediately\" expanded by \"hundreds of additional migrants per day above current rates,\" Nielsen said in a statement on Monday.\nThe policy is already being challenged in court by civil rights groups. As of March 26, approximately 370 migrants had been returned to Mexico since the program began in late January, a Mexican official said last week.\nAsked about the numbers, a DHS spokeswoman declined to confirm them and said the policy \"is still in the early stages of implementation.\"\nCritics of the administration say the policy hampers asylum cases, by making it far more difficult for those immigrants to obtain legal assistance. People who have been returned to Mexico to wait are struggling to find attorneys and receive notice of their proceedings in U.S. courts, rights advocates said.\nTrump administration officials say the MPP is a way to address the failings of the current system, which they claim encourages illegal immigration. Families that claim asylum are often released into the United States because of limits on how long children can be held in detention, allowing them to stay for years while their cases move through a backlogged immigration court system even though many claims are ultimately denied.\nThe administration is hoping policies of deterrence will reduce the number of people who turn themselves in to U.S. border agents, overwhelming the capacity of processing centers along the southern border.\nMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday that Mexico will help to regulate the flow of Central Americans passing through its territory to the United States. He said the root causes behind the phenomenon, which include violence and poverty in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, must be tackled.\nIn a move Democrats and Republicans in Congress have said would be counterproductive, the U.S. State Department cut aid to the three countries after Trump accused them of having \"set up\" migrant caravans and sending them north.\nCourt hearings\nLast week, a San Diego immigration judge heard from the first Central American families that were returned to Mexico under the MPP policy. The judge, Scott Simpson, had the previous week heard claims from single adults who had been returned, and both times expressed concerns over how the protocol is working. Of four families in court on Wednesday, just one had an attorney.\nBut Yanira Esmeralda Chavez, a Salvadoran fruit seller, accompanied by her three boys did not have a lawyer as she made her case to Simpson. The family had been staying at a shelter in the Mexican border city of Tijuana, and asked to remain in the United States because they feared being sent back to Mexico.\n\"I called the numbers on the attorney list that they provided me, but they said they cannot take my case because I am in Tijuana,\" Chavez said in the hearing. \"It would be better if I stay in the U.S., where I have family members.\"\nBecause she expressed fear of return, Simpson said Chavez and her children would be referred to a U.S. asylum officer, who would assess their claims. The outcome of that request was not known, but in prior cases, two people who had expressed similar fears were nevertheless returned to Mexico.\nAsylum seekers typically undergo what is known as an interview to assess their \"credible fear\" of returning to their home country. But the standard of proof for a \"reasonable fear\" of being returned to Mexico under the MPP is much stiffer.\nSimpson gave Chavez two more months to obtain an attorney, and said that her family in the United States could perhaps help her find a lawyer.\nThroughout the day, Simpson expressed his concerns about the policy, saying he was \"skeptical\" about migrants getting their notices to appear in court, given the court does not have proper addresses for those returned to Mexico.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and other groups sued the Trump administration over the policy, claiming it violates U.S. law.\nBut following a March 22 hearing on whether to halt the program, U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco ordered both sides to submit further briefing on the question of whether or not the California court has jurisdiction over the case, likely prolonging any decision on the policy.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirstjen nielsen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "department of homeland security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "border protection", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. customs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el salvador", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guatemala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "honduras", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T02:53:54.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9025baa34657b730678b6df46726c903ad091f12", "url": "https://247sports.com/college/georgia/Article/Georgia-Football-Deandre-Baker-No-16-Pro-Football-Focus-Big-Board-130779310/", "site_full": "247sports.com", "site": "247sports.com", "site_section": "http://georgia.247sports.com/Page/Georgia-Football-Recruiting-100017/Headlines.rss", "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "Dawgs247 Georgia Bulldogs Home News", "title": "Georgia's Deandre Baker No. 16 on PFF's big board", "title_full": "Georgia's Deandre Baker No. 16 on PFF's big board", "published": "2019-04-01T22:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/211/875/8875211.jpg?fit=bounds&amp;crop=1200:630,offset-y0.50&amp;width=1200&amp;height=630", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2230, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 61, "comments": 1, "shares": 8}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9025baa34657b730678b6df46726c903ad091f12", "url": "https://247sports.com/college/georgia/Article/Georgia-Football-Deandre-Baker-No-16-Pro-Football-Focus-Big-Board-130779310/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-01T22:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "Georgia's Deandre Baker No. 16 on PFF's big board", "text": "\nDeandre Baker sat out the Allstate Sugar Bowl at the first of the year because it was almost a foregone conclusion that he'd be a first-round pick in the 2019 NFL Draft. After the NFL Combine, when Baker posted a lackluster time of 4.52 in the 40-yard dash, he fell out of the first round on some mock drafts.\nA strong showing at UGA's Pro Day late last month has him trending upward once again and on Monday, Pro Football Focus revealed that he's well within their top 20 prospects.\nPFF has Baker at No. 16 and he's the only Bulldog listed on their top-50 big board.\n\"Baker has posted back-to-back 90.0-plus graded seasons in coverage,' PFF writes. \"This past year, he allowed all of 10 first downs all season and no touchdowns.\"\n\"You've always got to put it together on film like I do so I don't really worry about it...,\" Baker said. \"My film is undeniable. You can't overlook that, what I do.\"\nBaker's last two seasons at Georgia were nothing short of special. He racked up 84 total tackles, five interceptions, and 19 pass breakups. More importantly, he went 28 straight games without giving up a touchdown. The last time a receiver was able to beat him for a score was the 2016 Liberty Bowl.\nGeorgia did something a little different with Baker in his senior year, something that added a degree of difficulty to his streak of games without giving up a touchdown. Week in and week out, Baker would shadow the opposing team's top receiver. In week two against South Carolina, it was Deebo Samuel . Baker held him to six catches for 33 yards.\nAgainst Vanderbilt, it was Kalija Lipscomb and Baker held him to two catches for 16 yards. Baker also held Florida's Van Jefferson without a catch and Biletnikoff Award-winning receiver Jerry Jeudy of Alabama to a pair of catches for 14 yards. Jeudy caught a 10-yard touchdown against the Bulldogs but it was against Bulldog STAR/nickel defender Tyrique McGhee .\nBut it's more than just what Baker can do in coverage that makes him a big-time NFL prospect.\n\"He's gonna be a great pro,\" Kirby Smart said. \"He's a competitor, he's physical, he runs well, he's played in a system where he can play multiple coverages, we asked him to make a lot of checks. He's going to be a really good pro player. Really, at the end of the day, it's not going to be the 40 time that measures his success. It's going to be his ability to break on the ball, tackle, cover people and that's what he's proven to do in a pretty good conference.\"\nThe 2019 NFL Draft begins with the first round on April 25.

Death row inmate Russell Bucklew is shown in this Missouri Department of Corrections photo taken Feb. 9, 2014. In a decision that exposed stark divisions among the justices on the death penalty, the court ruled 5-4 that Bucklew had failed to present enough evidence to pursue his request to be executed by lethal gas. The court's five conservatives were in the majority and its four liberals dissented.\nReferring to the history of capital punishment, conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the court's majority that \"the Eighth Amendment does not guarantee a prisoner a painless death \u2014 something that, of course, isn't guaranteed to many people, including most victims of capital crimes.\"\nA spokesman for Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, a Republican, said: \"The state of Missouri and the victims of Russell Bucklew's crimes have waited 23 long years for this just and lawful sentence to be carried out. With today's ruling we are one step closer to justice.\"\nBucklew's lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMonday's ruling was in line with a 2015 decision in which the court rejected a challenge to Oklahoma's method of execution by lethal injection. In that case, the court held that inmates challenging a method of execution must come up with an alternative option that was less painful.\nBucklew failed to show that lethal gas could be \"readily implemented\" as required under Supreme Court precedent, the court ruled. There also was no evidence that his chosen alternative, lethal gas, would be less painful, it concluded.\nFILE - Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch joins other justices of the U.S. Supreme Court for an official group portrait at the Supreme Court Building in Washington, June 1, 2017. Gorsuch, appointed by President Donald Trump in 2017, noted that Bucklew is awaiting execution for crimes committed more than two decades ago.\n\"Yet since then, he has managed to secure delay through lawsuit after lawsuit,\" Gorsuch wrote, echoing a view often expressed by death penalty advocates.\nFellow conservative Justice Samuel Alito said in 2015 that the legal challenge to Oklahoma's method of execution case was part of a \"guerilla war\" against the death penalty.\nBucklew was convicted of the 1996 murder in southeastern Missouri of Michael Sanders, who was living with Bucklew's former girlfriend Stephanie Ray at the time. Bucklew fatally shot Sanders at his trailer home, kidnapped and raped Ray, shot at Sanders' 6-year-old son and wounded a police officer before being apprehended, according to court papers.\nBucklew's appeal neither contested his guilt nor sought to avoid execution.\nThe case did not challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty itself. The court has barred the execution of juveniles and mentally disabled people, but there are no signs that its conservative majority is inclined to find capital punishment unconstitutional.\n'Vigilance and care'\nLiberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor took issue with Gorsuch, writing in a dissenting opinion that questions about legal tactics that lead to delays are \"wholly irrelevant\" to the case before the court.\n\"The majority seems to imply that this litigation has been no more than manipulation of the judicial process for the purpose of delaying Bucklew's execution,\" Sotomayor wrote.\nFILE - Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor is seen during the group portrait at the Supreme Court Building in Washington, Oct. 8, 2010. When death row inmates seek last-minute stays of execution, courts should consider individual cases on their merits, Sotomayor said.\n\"Our jurisprudence must remain one of vigilance and care, not one of dismissiveness,\" Sotomayor added.\nLiberal Justice Stephen Breyer in another dissenting opinion repeated his assertion, first raised in the 2015 case, that if prisoners cannot be executed quickly without violating their rights \"it may be that ... there simply is no constitutional way to implement the death penalty.\"\nIn Missouri, execution is authorized using either injection or gas, but the state in practice uses only lethal injection.\nThe high court last year blocked Bucklew's execution on a 5-4 vote. The conservative justice who voted with the court's four liberals to grant the stay, Anthony Kennedy, has since retired and was replaced by Kavanaugh.\nOther recent cases also illustrated the court's differences over the death penalty. The court in February voted 5-4 to allow the execution of a Muslim convicted murderer after Alabama denied his request to have an imam present, saying he waited too long to file his lawsuit.\nIn an abrupt turnaround, the court last week blocked the execution of a convicted murderer whose request to have his Buddhist spiritual adviser present at the execution was denied by Texas.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bucklew", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russell bucklew", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "us supreme court", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri department of corrections", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T02:56:24.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7a50a2a84b356e34779f00159f74a2ca85ebb3ce", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-lists-fentanyl-controlled-substance-us-gesture-105135543.html", "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "media", "tech"], "section_title": "Yahoo News - Latest News &amp; Headlines", "title": "China lists fentanyl as controlled substance in US gesture", "title_full": "China lists fentanyl as controlled substance in US gesture", "published": "2019-04-01T18:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2OlAvF1GGA0rokAejjUk2Q--~B/aD0xMDI0O3c9MTYyOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en_US/News/US-AFPRelax/istock_687356630.b8398165941.original.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7a50a2a84b356e34779f00159f74a2ca85ebb3ce", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-lists-fentanyl-controlled-substance-us-gesture-105135543.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "AFP Relax News", "published": "2019-04-01T18:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "China lists fentanyl as controlled substance in US gesture", "text": "China announced Monday it will launch a crackdown on all fentanyl-like substances from May 1 following US pleas for Beijing to control a drug fuelling a deadly opioid crisis.
