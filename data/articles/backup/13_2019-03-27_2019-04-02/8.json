We will carry the same confidence into Malaysia and look to improve on key areas which we felt needed to be worked on after analysing our performance in Spain,\" Savita said.\n\"Whatever we are doing now is all part of the preparations for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics qualifying event later this year and we are looking to improve as a team as well as our individual performance,\" explained Savita.\nGoing into the tour with some key players missing due to injuries such as experienced striker Rani, midfielder Namita Toppo and dragflicker Gurjit Kaur, Savita said the tour will be a good platform for the youngsters to step up and make use of the opportunity.\n\"I think we have good depth in the team now with quite a few talented youngsters who have had good international exposure. They know what is required at this level and are aware of their individual responsibilities. This will be a good tour for them to show their capabilities so that they will stand a chance to make the team for the all important 2020 Tokyo Olympics Qualifying event this year,\" she said.

The US knows that very well,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a media briefing here on Monday.\nAsked to clarify whether the progress he meant was to resolve the vexed issue of listing Azhar, Geng said, \"Yes. The US knows that very well\". However, he did not elaborate.\nChina has so far blocked the move four times in recent years. On March 13, it blocked a proposal by France and backed by the US and the UK, in the 1267 Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee, saying Beijing wanted more time to study the case. A hold on the proposal would also provided time and space for the relevant parties to hold talks after the Pulwama terrorist attack, the Chinese foreign ministry said.\nFollowing this, the US directly moved a resolution in the UN Security Council on March 27 to blacklist Azhar which China said amounted to undermining the 1267 Committee.\nIndia handed over a dossier to the Acting High Commissioner of Pakistan in New Delhi on February 27 with specific details of Pakistan-based terror group JeM's complicity in the Pulwama attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel on February 14 and the presence of JeM terror camps and its leadership in Pakistan. Pakistan has already said that it has not found any link between the JeM and the Pulwama terror attack and demanded more information/evidence from India.\nMonday's comments by the spokesman was the first time Beijing spoke of progress to resolve the Azhar issue.\n\"We believe under the current circumstances forcing a draft resolution at the Security Council is not a constructive move and set a bad example,\" Geng said.\nLashing out at the US for taking the Azhar issue to the UNSC from the 1267 Committee which also functioned under UNSC framework, Geng claimed support from majority of UNSC members to China's stand that the issue should be resolved by the 1267 Committee.\n\"We hope various parties will meet each other half way and continue to properly solve this issue under the 1267 Committee framework. Last Friday, UNSC members exchanged views on the US proposed draft resolution. The majority believes that efforts should be made to solve the issues under 1267 Committee framework,\" he said.\n\"They are not in favour of forcing the draft resolution. China has been working with various parties and is making progress. The US knows that very well and yet, it insists on pushing the Security Council to adopt the draft resolution,\" he said.\n\"This cannot be justified and is not in accordance with the rules and practices of the Security Council. It is setting a bad example that will only complicate the matter. It is also not conducive for peace and stability in South Asia. China is opposed to this,\" he said.\nTo another question about criticism that the US is making hasty efforts to list Azhar by bypassing procedures to benefit BJP in India's General Elections, Geng said the US' stand is not conducive to peace and stability in South Asia.\n\"It is setting a bad example that will only complicate the matter. It is also not conducive for peace and stability in South Asia. The General Elections is the domestic affair of India. We do not comment on that,\" he said.

Jenny Phillips, who died last year, was the granddaughter of Hemingway's editor and friend, Maxwell Perkins.\nIts mission is to work with Cuban colleagues to restore and preserve \"Finca Vigia\" (Lookout Farm) -- the Havana home of the Nobel literature laureate -- as well as its contents and his fishing boat.\nThe boat had already been renovated and the home restored \"to its 1950s splendour,\" according to the foundation website.\nNow the on-site archival storage facility, whose construction began in 2015, has also opened, with McGovern cutting a ribbon and reviewing the archives, which include Hemingway's passport.\nThe congressman, who favours scrapping the six-decade-old US trade embargo against Cuba, later met with President Miguel Diaz-Canel.\nGladys Collazo, director of Cuba's National Council of Cultural Heritage, said the new facility is the result of collaboration among \"people of goodwill\" despite the obstacles.\nIn a separate statement the council said \"there are many US interests linked to cultural exchanges with Cuba that are curbed by the setback in bilateral relations.\" \"With very little money, and in the midst of a dauntingly difficult political climate, this project has flourished and continues to grow,\" the foundation said.\nHemingway wrote many of his classics including \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" and \"The Old Man and the Sea\" at Finca Vigia.\nMost of Hemingway's time in Cuba preceded the 1959 communist revolution. He committed suicide in 1961 after returning to the United States. (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

With a backlog of more than 700,000 immigration cases, asylum seekers can wait years for their cases to progress, and officials say some people game the system in order to live in the U.S.\nOfficials hope to have as many as 300 people returned per day by the end of the week, focusing particularly on those who come in between ports of entry, said the official, who had knowledge of the plans but was unauthorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\nBut the process so far has been slow-going, and such a sizeable increase may be difficult to achieve.\nThe plan has already been marred by confusion, scheduling glitches and an inability by some attorneys to reach their clients.\nIn San Ysidro alone, Mexico had been prepared to accept up to 120 asylum seekers per week, but for the first six weeks only 40 people per week were returned.\nPlus, U.S. officials must check if asylum seekers have any felony convictions and notify Mexico at least 12 hours before they are returned.\nThose who cross illegally must have come as single adults, though the administration is in talks with the Mexican government to include families. Children are not returned.\nHomeland Security officials have been grappling with an ever-growing number of Central American children and families coming over the border.\nArrests soared in February to a 12-year-high and more than half of those stopped arrived as families, many of them asylum seekers who generally turn themselves in instead of trying to elude capture.\nGuatemala and Honduras have replaced Mexico as the top countries, a remarkable shift from only a few years ago. Migrants from Central America cannot be easily deported, unlike people crossing from Mexico.\nMexico has been treading lightly on the subject. After Trump lashed out, saying Mexico and the Central American nations were \"doing nothing\" about illegal immigration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said his country would do everything it could to help to maintain a \"very respectful relationship\" with the U.S. government and Trump.\nMeanwhile, Nielsen sent a letter to the heads of other agencies within her sprawling, 240,000-person department, asking for volunteers to help with border duties.\nAnd she wrote to Congress asking for more temporary facilities to process people, more detention space, and the ability to detain families indefinitely and to deport unaccompanied minors from Central America.\nWhile children from Mexico can be returned over the border, laws prohibit deportation to other countries.\nDemocratic congressional leaders expressed deep concern, saying the administration wanted to revive \"horrific\" and \"immoral\" plans, noting its failed hardline border policies have created \"senseless heartbreak and horror.\" \"Democrats reject any effort to let the administration deport little children, and we reject all anti-immigrant and anti-family attacks from this President,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement.

moving toward \"high-quality universal healthcare\"; and seizing the nation's \"last best hope of averting a (climate) catastrophe.\" He called for the US to wind down its foreign wars, strengthen its alliances, and \"end these love affairs with dictators and strongmen.\" His message clearly was geared not just to El Pasoans but to Democrats nationwide as the party gears up for an extended campaign to see who will challenge Trump in 2020.\nO'Rourke pointed out that he helped boost voter turnout in Texas -- particularly among the young -- to some of its highest levels in years.\nHe had made his intention to run for the presidency known in mid-March, and in a single day raked in a huge $6.1 million in donations, giving himself instant relevance in the crowded Democratic field.\nHe since has been campaigning -- usually before large crowds -- in early-voting states including Iowa and New Hampshire.\nAnd on Saturday, O'Rourke -- who during his Senate campaign visited every one of Texas's 254 counties -- continued his peripatetic ways, heading from his El Paso kickoff to rallies in Houston and Austin, the state capital.\nThe 46-year-old former congressman and onetime punk rocker was born Robert O'Rourke but widely known as \"Beto.\" His nearly successful campaign in November against incumbent Senator Ted Cruz brought him national attention.\nSome Democrats hope O'Rourke might even be able to turn reliably red Texas to Democratic blue, though first he would have to wade through the huge field of 16 Democrats now in the running -- including a popular fellow Texan, Julian Castro.\nOther Democratic rivals include senators Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar.\nThe Democratic frontrunner, former vice president Joe Biden, is not even officially in the race, but polls show him as the leading contender for the party's nomination, with 29.2 percent support, according to the RealClearPolitics average of the six latest surveys.\nSanders is second at 21.8 percent, followed by Harris at 9.8 and O'Rourke at 9.2.\nThe newest rising star of the pack is Pete Buttigieg, 37, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana and a military veteran, who would be the youngest and the first openly gay president should he win.\nO'Rourke is an unorthodox candidate, with a comparatively thin political resume and with a seeming allergy to being labeled a liberal. During his six years in Congress, O'Rourke was more politically cautious, joining the House's centrist coalition.\nBut as the Democratic presidential field tilts leftward, he has hit on several progressive talking points.\nIn addition to supporting a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, he backs marijuana legalization and champions the Green New Deal, a sweeping climate change mitigation framework.\nHe called Saturday for paid family leave, equal pay for women and an end to for-profit prisons.\nOn his first major campaign tour, which took him to eight states including New Hampshire, South Carolina and Ohio, he met people in coffee shops, school gyms and taquerias, offering a unifying vision packed with optimism but short on policy specifics.

His body has never been recovered.\nAfter having denied the murder, Saudi Arabia said the operation was carried out by agents who were out of control. A trial of 11 suspects opened earlier this year in Saudi Arabia.\nBut much of the case remains shrouded, beginning with the role of Saudi Arabia's powerful crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman.\nThe US Senate, after a closed-door briefing by the CIA, adopted a resolution naming the crown prince as \"responsible\" for the murder, while President Donald Trump has refused to publicly take a stand.\nAccording to Washington Post columnist David Ignatius, a Saudi who closely read the transcript of a recording from a bug placed in the consulate by Turkish intelligence said it indicates the plan was to kidnap Khashoggi and bring him back to Saudi Arabia for detention and interrogation.\nA note in the transcript says an injection was administered to Khashoggi, which the Saudi source said was probably a powerful sedative.\nA bag was then placed over his head, and Khashoggi screamed: \"I can't breathe, I have asthma. Don't do this.\" According to the Post, he died soon after.\nThe transcript describes a buzzing noise, perhaps an electric saw used to dismember the journalist.\nAccording to Ignatius, who said he interviewed more than a dozen American and Saudi sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, some members of the Saudi Rapid Intervention Group received training in the United States.\n\"The CIA has cautioned other government agencies that some of this special-operations training might have been conducted by Tier 1 Group, an Arkansas-based company, under a State Department license,\" he said.\n\"The training occurred before the Khashoggi incident, as part of ongoing liaison with the Saudis, and it hasn't been resumed.\" He said several other US-Saudi security exchange programs also have been suspended.

against terror, not country: John Abraham\nIndia and the US have underlined the need for Pakistan to take \"meaningful, irreversible and verifiable\" action against terrorists and terror groups operating from its soil as Washington backed the people and Government of India in the fight against terrorism.\nThe two countries exchanged views on threats posed by international terrorist organisations during the US- India Counter- terrorism Joint Working Group and Designations Dialogue that concluded here Friday, weeks after the Pulwama terror attack carried out by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad terror group that killed 40 CRPF personnel, prompting the international community to ask Islamabad to rein-in all terror groups on its soil.\nWhile the US delegation was led by State Department Coordinator for Counter- terrorism Ambassador Nathan Sales, the Indian side was headed by Joint Secretary, Ministry of External Affairs, Mahaveer Singhvi.\n\"Both sides underlined the urgent need for Pakistan to take meaningful, irreversible, and verifiable action against terrorists and terrorist groups,\" according to a joint statement.\nIt said the two sides discussed counter-terrorism cooperation between them and resolved to continue close coordination on this important element of the bilateral relationship.\nSales, according to the joint statement, emphasised the US support for the people and government of India in the fight against terrorism.\nThere was also discussion of strengthening cooperation on information sharing and other steps to disrupt the ability of terrorists to travel, consistent with the important provisions and obligations outlined in the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2396.\nIndian and American officials also highlighted their efforts on some of the world's most pressing counter-terrorism challenges, including countering the financing and operations of terrorist organisations, terrorist use of the internet, and prosecuting, rehabilitating, and reintegrating returning foreign terrorist fighters, said the statement.\nThe US, it said, welcomed India's participation in international efforts to counter terrorism finance.\nThe two sides also shared information about their priorities and procedures for pursuing sanctions designations against terrorist groups and individuals, the joint statement said, in an apparent reference to the latest US efforts at the UN Security Council to designate Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist.\nAfter China for the fourth time blocked a proposal to designate Azhar a global terrorist by the 1267 Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council, the US, backed by the UK and France, moved a resolution directly to the Security Council, to blacklist the JeM chief.

Wade.\nSince taking office in 2017, President Donald Trump has named two justices to the Supreme Court who oppose abortion, leading activists who support abortion rights to fear that Roe v. Wade could be overturned.\nGeorgia is an important destination for film and television production, but dozens of Hollywood celebrities threatened to take their business elsewhere if the law takes effect.\n\"We will do everything in our power to move our industry to a safer state for women\" if the bill is approved, said a letter to lawmakers signed by Alyssa Milano, Alec Baldwin, Amy Schumer, Ben Stiller, Sarah Silverman, Mia Farrow and others.

Some 5,200 troops are stationed in Iraq as part of a security agreement with the Iraqi government to advise, assist and support the country's troops in the fight against the Islamic State.\nIS overran large parts of Iraq in 2014 after Iraqi forces collapsed, and it proceeded to declare a self-styled caliphate over territory straddling Iraq and Syria. US forces, which had left Iraq in 2011 after invading in 2003, were invited back to assist the fight against the group, and Iraq declared victory over IS in late 2017 after a ruinous and bloody war.\n\"They are here for the specific mission of empowering and enabling Iraqi forces in the fight against ISIS. Nothing else. That is the specific exclusive mission, and in that context, I do not see serious opposition to the presence of these forces in Iraq today,\" Salih said.\nSalih's comments stand in stark contrast with that of mostly Iran-backed deputies in the Iraqi Parliament, who say they are preparing draft laws calling for a full withdrawal of US troops now that the war against IS is over.\nAn unannounced visit to Iraq by Trump in December, during which he failed to meet with the prime minister, as well as recent comments in which Trump said he wanted US troops to remain in Iraq to \"watch Iran,\" have also provoked outrage in Baghdad and fueled the debate.\nSalih said any mission beyond what has been agreed to by the Iraqi government \"is a subject that many political leaders of the country would take objection to.\" He said he recently led a conversation among all the major political groupings of the country, and there is \"general consensus that Iraq needs that collaboration.\" A debate or vote is not scheduled in Parliament for the time being, he said.\nWhile he said the territorial defeat of IS was hugely significant, Salih said remnants of the group were still operating and moving around in both Syria and Iraq. \"This threat is far from over. We really need we in Iraq, Syria and the entire international community to be vigilant and to make sure that we deal definitely with this threat of extremism,\" he said.\nSalih also said the international community should shoulder its responsibility in dealing with the thousands of IS detainees and their families currently being held in Syria and Iraq.\n\"There has to be a framework that will bring the international community together, both legally as well as in terms of the logistics and security ramifications of dealing with the numbers of ISIS detainees,\" he said.\nIraqi detention centers and courts are already overwhelmed with IS suspects, and the country has recently begun repatriating IS militants detained in Syria. They include 13 French nationals who will be put on trial for crimes committed inside Iraq. Salih said that although he is personally opposed to capital punishment, he would abide by the Iraqi laws and the constitution if the French nationals were to be handed the death sentence.\nIn the interview, Salih added that Iraq is advocating the readmittance of Syria back into the Arab League, and he said he hoped that the remaining Arab countries would work together toward that goal.\nSyria's membership was suspended in 2011 in the early days of the uprising against President Bashar Assad.\nWhile some Arab leaders think Syria a founding member should be readmitted, others like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have spent years supporting the insurgency.\n\"We better embrace Syria, and hope Syria overcomes the difficulties it has been facing. Simply isolating Syria is not the way to move forward,\" Salih said. The Iraqi president also called for the withdrawal of Turkish troops from northern Iraq, adding that their continued presence was an obstacle to the development of relations between the two countries.

The US and Chinese officials stepped up talks to finalise a deal.\nOn Friday, both sides resumed trade talks here, giving another push to their high-stakes negotiations to end their months-long tariff war.\nChinese Vice-Premier Liu He met US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in the Chinese capital, after the two sides kick-started the talks over a working dinner on Thursday in a clear effort to speed up negotiations.\nAs the US delegation left their hotel earlier in the day, Mnuchin said they had a \"very productive\" working dinner on Thursday evening.\n\"A full day of intense negotiations has been scheduled on Friday to cover as much ground as possible. Issues identified included the protection of intellectual property rights, government subsidies for state-owned enterprises, trade barriers, market access and the US' trade deficit with China,\" the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.\nWhite House Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow said on Thursday that the Trump administration was prepared to stretch the talks for \"months\" and Washington was in no rush to resolve the conflict.\n\"We are getting close, but we are not there yet,\" Kudlow said.\nAs they resumed talks, both sides, however, traded charges over the BRI, President Xi's signature initiative to fund infrastructure development abroad to expand China's influence.\nChinese infrastructure and connectivity projects around the world have an element of \"national security\" and are less of an economic offer for host countries, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said as Beijing is gearing to host the second Belt and Road Forum.\nPompeo Thursday told a Washington audience that China poses security threat to the US, its friends and allies.\n\"They are moving into the South China Sea is not because they want freedom of navigation. Their efforts to build ports around the world aren't because they want to be good shipbuilders and stewards of waterways, but rather they have a state national security element to each and every one of them,\" Pompeo said.\nThe Belt and Road Initiative is no different, he asserted.\nRefuting the allegations, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang told a media briefing here that \"for some time, it seems that some US politicians cannot go anywhere without attacking China, tarnishing China's reputation, and sensationalising the so-called \"China threat\".\n\"They frame China's development assistance as a 'debt trap' and accuse Chinese enterprises of spying with trumped-up charges. These actions are extremely immoral and unfair,\" he said.\n\"I want to stress that a lie, even repeated a thousand times, will still be a lie. Certain people in the US should not overestimate the effectiveness of their rumour-mongering or underestimate other people's ability to make informed judgments,\" he said.\nHe said, both Italy and Luxemburg have signed up to BRI which is backed 150 countries and international organisations.\nPreparations are underway for the second Belt Road Forum (BRF) to be held here next month to highlight the achievements of BRI, he said.\nIndia did not attend the first BRF held in 2017 and signalled to boycott the second BRF over its objections on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.\n\"To be honest, we have made no secret of our views and our position on BRI is clear and consistent and one that we have conveyed to the authorities concerned, India's Ambassador to China Vikram Misri told the Chinese state-run daily Global Times recently.\n\"Above all, connectivity initiatives must be pursued in a manner that respects sovereignty, equality and territorial integrity of nations. No country can participate in an initiative that ignores its core concerns on sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" he said.

HIV-positive patients can receive transplants from HIV-negative donors just like anyone else.\nOnly in the last few years, spurred by some pioneering operations in South Africa, have doctors begun transplanting organs from deceased donors with HIV into patients who also have the virus, organs that once would have been thrown away.\nSince 2016, 116 such kidney and liver transplants have been performed in the US as part of a research study, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, or UNOS, which oversees the transplant system.\nOne question is whether receiving an organ from someone with a different strain of HIV than their own poses any risks, but so far there have been no safety problems, said UNOS chief medical officer Dr David Klassen.\nHopkins' Segev said Monday's kidney transplant was a world first. Doctors had hesitated to allow people still living with HIV to donate because of concern that their remaining kidney would be at risk of damage from the virus or older medications used to treat it.\nBut newer anti-HIV medications are safer and more effective, Segev said. His team recently studied the kidney health of 40,000 HIV-positive people and concluded that those with well-controlled HIV and no other kidney-harming ailments like high blood pressure should face the same risks from living donation as someone without HIV.\n\"There are potentially tens of thousands of people living with HIV right now who could be living kidney donors,\" said Segev, who has advised some other hospitals considering the approach.\nGenerally, kidneys from living donors last longer, added Dr Niraj Desai, the Hopkins surgeon caring for the recipient. And if more people living with HIV wind up donating, it helps more than HIV-positive patients who need a kidney.\n\"That's one less person waiting for a limited resource,\" Desai said. \"That helps everybody on the list.\" Martinez, a public health consultant, became interested in living donation even before HIV-to-HIV transplants began. Then last summer she learned that an HIV-positive friend needed a transplant, and tracked down Segev to ask if she could donate.\nHer friend died before Martinez finished the required health tests but she decided to honour him by donating to someone she didn't know.\nA runner who plans on making this fall's Marine Corps Marathon, \"I knew I was probably just as healthy as someone not living with HIV who was being evaluated as a kidney donor,\" Martinez said. \"I've never been surer of anything.

This has reduced the authority of the Committee as a main anti- terrorism body of the UNSC and this is not conducive to the solidarity and only complicates the issue.\n\"We urge the US to act cautiously and avoid forcefully moving forward this draft resolution,\" Geng said.\n\"Since China needs more time to conduct in-depth and comprehensive review, we put a technical hold to the relevant listing on March 13,\" he said, referring to the previous move by France, the US and the UK.\nThis is in line with the rules and procedure of the committee and there are some precedents of such \"technical holds\", he said.\nThe listing of Masood involves a series of complex factors and China has also been working to seek a proper solution through dialogue and consensus, Geng said.\n\"Under the current circumstances, the Security Council should act in a prudent way to play a constructive role and create the necessary time and space for the relevant parties to conduct dialogue and negotiations,\" he said referring to China's hold on the proposal.\nThe US has bypassed the 1267 Committee and directly filed the draft resolution to the Security Council. This is not in line with the resolution of the issue through dialogue and negotiations, Geng added.\nUN sources in New York told PTI that this is the \"first time\" the US, the UK and France have moved a draft resolution directly in the Security Council to designate Azhar. The previous have been listing proposals in the Sanctions Committee of the Council to designate Azhar.\nUnlike a listing proposal, which is generally under a 10- day no objection period, the draft resolution is not under any no-objection provision.\nA UNSC designation will subject Azhar to an assets freeze, travel ban and an arms embargo.

It has disrupted trade in goods from soybeans to medical equipment.\nThat is fueling fears the battle between the two biggest economies will chill global growth that already shows signs of slowing.\nNeither side has indicated they are making progress on the core of the dispute: US pressure on Beijing to drop industrial strategies its trading partners say violate its market-opening obligations and might be based on stealing technology.\nThat includes plans for government-led creation of Chinese global competitors in robotics and other technology.\nA stumbling block appears to be Washington's insistence on an enforcement mechanism with penalties if Beijing fails to follow through on commitments.\nTrump also raised another potential obstacle last week, saying he wants to keep in place 25 percent taxes on $50 billion of Chinese goods. The president said, \"we need that.\" Beijing is not \"in the biggest hurry\" so long as Washington delays imposing additional tariffs, said Bryan Mercurio, a trade law specialist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\nChinese negotiators want to avoid giving too much before they figure out what Washington will settle for, said Mercurio, a former Canadian trade negotiator.\n\"You never really know what the Trump administration wants,\" said Mercurio.\nSeparately, Premier Li Keqiang, China's No. 2 leader and economic czar, told a conference in southern China that Beijing plans to open its financial sector further and beef up its rules on foreign companies' mergers and acquisitions within China.\nLi was speaking at the Boao Forum for Asia, an annual meeting in the coastal town of Boao.\nThe official Xinhua News agency cited Li as promising to improve access to China's bond, banking, securities and insurance markets.

The previous have been listing proposals in the Sanctions Committee of the Council to designate Azhar.\nUnlike a listing proposal, which is generally under a 10- day no objection period, the draft resolution is not under any no-objection provision.\nReacting to Washington's move, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang in Beijing said: \"This is not in line with resolution of the issue through dialogue and negotiations. This has reduced the authority of the Committee as a main anti- terrorism body of the UNSC and this is not conducive to the solidarity and only complicates the issue\".\n\"We urge the US to act cautiously and avoid forcefully moving forward this draft resolution,\" Geng said.\nSources in New York said that the draft resolution will be discussed informally and then it goes to the Council.\nHowever, it's not yet decided by when a vote would be held on the draft resolution, during when it could again face a veto by China, which has in the past blocked bids to blacklist Azhar.\nSources said the draft resolution would condemn \"in the strongest terms the heinous and cowardly suicide bombing\" on February 14 in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district that killed 40 CRPF personnel.\nAn annex to the draft resolution says Azhar is associated with the Islamic State terror group, Al-Qaida for \"participating in the financing, planning, facilitating, preparing, or perpetrating\" or \"supplying, selling or transferring arms and related material\" or supporting acts of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM).\nIt says that Azhar founded JeM after his release from prison in India in 1999 in exchange for 155 hostages held on an Indian Airlines flight that had been hijacked to Kandahar, Afghanistan.\nIt adds that Azhar was previously the leader of the terrorist group Harakat al Mujahadin, also known as Harakat ul-Ansar, and that most of these groups' members subsequently joined Jaish under Azhar's leadership.\nIn 2008, JeM recruitment posters contained a call from Azhar for volunteers to join the fight in Afghanistan against Western forces.\nThe Sanctions Committee makes its decisions by consensus of its members. However, for a resolution in the Security Council to pass, it needs nine votes in favour and no vetoes from any of its five permanent members - China, Russia, the United States, France and the UK.\nFrance, the UK and the US on February 27 moved a proposal to designate Azhar under the 1267 Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee.\nIt was under the no-objection period and Committee members had a period of 10 working days to raise any objections to the proposal.\nMore than a dozen member states had co-sponsored the proposal. About an hour before the no-objection deadline was to expire on March 13 at 3 PM, China blocked the proposal by putting a hold on it.\nIndia expressed disappointment by the outcome, saying in a statement \"this has prevented action by the international community to designate the leader of JeM, a proscribed and active terrorist organisation which has claimed responsibility for the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir on 14 February 2019\".\nMeanwhile, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made an apparent reference to China blocking the proposal when he said Wednesday that China abuses over a million Muslims at home, but \"protects\" violent Islamic terror groups from UN sanctions.\nThe February proposal was the fourth such bid at the UN in the last 10 years to list Azhar as a global terrorist.\nIn 2009, India moved a proposal by itself to designate Azhar. In 2016 again India moved the proposal with the P3 - the US, the UK and France in the UN's 1267 Sanctions Committee to ban Azhar, also the mastermind of the attack on the air base in Pathankot in January, 2016.\nIn 2017, the P3 nations moved a similar proposal again. However, on all occasions China, a veto-wielding permanent member of the Security Council, blocked the proposals from being adopted by the Sanctions Committee.\nA UNSC designation will subject Azhar to an assets freeze, travel ban and an arms embargo. An assets freeze under the Sanctions Committee requires that all states freeze without delay the funds and other financial assets or economic resources of designated individuals and entities.\nThe travel ban entails preventing the entry into or transit by all states through their territories by designated individuals.\nUnder the arms embargo, all states are required to prevent the direct or indirect supply, sale and transfer from their territories or by their nationals outside their territories, or using their flag vessels or aircraft, of arms and related materiel of all types, spare parts and technical advice, assistance or training related to military activities, to designated individuals and entities.

Start-ups accounted for 59 per cent of the total PE investments recorded in 2018 by values and 26 per cent by volume,\" said Vrinda Mathur, partner, Grant Thornton India LLP.\nIn terms of the size of investments, the sharp increase in the PE and VC funding was due to 47 deals valued at USD 100 million or greater, including six deals worth over USD 500 million. Big-ticket investments were driven by complex deal structures, PE-backed merger and acquisition, later-stage funding and the inflated start-up valuations, it said.\nFurther, the report said it is not unusual to witness high levels of public spending in election years and it may push investments in rural and infrastructure-related sectors in the near term.\nThe core sectors may not get impacted as most mid-market investments take a long-term bet on growth potential, the report said.\nConsequently, PE deal volumes are expected to pick up in the second half of the year with 2020 expected to be the year of the highest volumes of PE investments.\nThe report focuses on the PE and VC industry in India and has been produced in association with the Indian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (IVCA), an organisation that works towards promotion of PE and VC firms.

'Back against the wall' The case is one of more than 11,200 similar cases in the US alone involving Roundup.\nLast August, Monsanto lost a case to a California school groundskeeper suffering from terminal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, who had sued the company over the glyphosate weedkillers Roundup and Ranger Pro.\nMonsanto was initially ordered to pay USD 289 million to Dewayne Johnson, before the damages were reduced to USD 78.5 million.\nBayer has also filed an appeal in that case.\nMonsanto has consistently denied that the weedkiller causes cancer and challenged findings by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, an arm of the World Health Organisation (WHO), which classified glyphosate as a \"probable carcinogen\" in 2015.\nBut other major agencies like the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) or the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have not followed suit.\nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, told AFP that Hardeman's case was \"important as a bellwether, which means it helps predict how future cases will be decided.\" Tobias said the verdict \"bodes well\" for plaintiffs in the thousands of other cases filed against Monsanto, and was \"likely to encourage plaintiffs and their counsel to be more vigorous in pursuing their cases and will lead more potential plaintiffs to file suit.\" The Environmental Working Group, a non-profit organisation, cheered Wednesday's verdict.\n\"Clearly, the testimony that informed the jury's decision was Bayer-Monsanto hiding Roundup's carcinogenic properties, manipulating the science and cozying-up with EPA so it would not have to warn consumers of its dangerous product,\" said the group's president Ken Cook.\n\"This verdict puts Bayer's back firmly up against the wall as the cost of litigation mounts and its stock price gets pummeled once again,\" he added.

Yesterday's A-SAT test does not alter this basic reality,\" Tellis told PTI.\nVipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that the test is unlikely to make any changes to the balance of power in the region. And as such it is more of a demonstration.\n\"If Pakistan starts hitting Indian satellites, India can knock out Pakistan's very few satellites. China can knock out all of India's satellites whereas India cannot do the same to China. So it's kind of a weird balance for India if it's interested in getting into the anti- satellite deterrence game (because) it doesn't really have an advantage in either of its dyads,\" Narang told Wired Magazine.\nDaryl G Kimball of the Arms Control Association think-tank in a tweet described this as a dangerous and destabilising move.\n\"A dangerous & destabilizing move. Underscores need for a global A-SAT ban. US gov't silence is deafening, given its negative reaction to China's '07 test,\" he said.\nDaniel Porras, Space Security Fellow at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR), said that there is a need to have A-SAT guidelines, in particular about the debris.\n\"A strong Indian military is an important American interest and space is increasingly a contested arena for political-military competition,\" Benjamin Schwartz from USIBC told PTI.\nIn New Delhi, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said the test was done in the lower atmosphere to ensure there is no space debris.\n\"Whatever debris that is generated will decay and fall back onto the earth within weeks,\" it said.\nThe MEA came out with a 10-point explainer to say the anti-satellite missile test was carried out to verify India's capability to safeguard space assets and that it was not directed against any country.\nIt also said in a statement that India has no intention of entering into an arms race in outer space.\n\"We have always maintained that space must be used only for peaceful purposes. We are against the weaponisation of Outer Space and support international efforts to reinforce the safety and security of space based assets,\" the MEA added.

Clearly in your case ignorance is certainly not bliss! Another sign of Trumpian mischief a la Khalilzad style!\" she wrote, referring to the US envoy leading the peace talks, Zalmay Khalilzad.\nWhen the Twitterverse accused her of violating diplomatic norms, she doubled down.\n\"Haha! Haters gonna hate! But seriously what diplomatic norms? US dips have been violating them all day today from Zalmay to this moron!\" she wrote in response to one critic.\nThe Taliban have long refused to speak with Kabul, deeming the administration of President Ashraf Ghani -- who is seeking re-election this year -- puppets of the West.\nThe US insists that it is negotiating with the insurgents on Afghan peace talks, but fears are sharp in Kabul that the government is being sidelined from its own peace process in Washington's rush to exit.\nMany predict a US withdrawal before any peace deal is done with Kabul could see the Taliban return to some semblance of power in Afghanistan, or for the fighting to fracture into a full-blown ethnic civil war.

It can be triggered by a number of things, including our emotions, neurotransmitters in the brain, or the caffeinated beverages we consume.\nIn this case the researchers wanted to explore how simply being exposed to things that remind us of coffee may have an effect on arousal.\nAcross four separate studies and using a mix of participants from western and eastern cultures, they compared coffee- and tea-related cues. They found that participants exposed to coffee-related cues perceived time as shorter and thought in more concrete, precise terms.\n\"People who experience physiological arousal -- again, in this case as the result of priming and not drinking coffee itself -- see the world in more specific, detailed terms,\" said Maglio.\n\"This has a number of implications for how people process information and make judgments and decisions,\" he said.\nHowever, the effect was not as strong among participants who grew up in eastern cultures. Maglio speculates that the association between coffee and arousal is not as strong in less coffee-dominated cultures.\nNext steps for the research will look at associations people have for different foods and beverages, researchers said. Just thinking about energy drinks or red wine, for example, could have very different effects on arousal.

The previous have been listing proposals in the Sanctions Committee of the Council to designate Azhar.\nUnlike a listing proposal, which is generally under a 10- day no objection period, the draft resolution is not under any no-objection provision.\nSources said that the draft resolution will be discussed informally and then it goes to the Council.\nHowever, it's not yet decided by when a vote would be held on the draft resolution, during when it could again face a veto by China, which has in the past blocked bids to blacklist Azhar.\nSources said the draft resolution would condemn \"in the strongest terms the heinous and cowardly suicide bombing\" on February 14 in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district that killed 40 CRPF personnel.\nAn annex to the draft resolution says Azhar is associated with the Islamic State terror group, Al-Qaida for \"participating in the financing, planning, facilitating, preparing, or perpetrating\" or \"supplying, selling or transferring arms and related material\" or supporting acts of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM).\nIt says that Azhar founded JeM after his release from prison in India in 1999 in exchange for 155 hostages held on an Indian Airlines flight that had been hijacked to Kandahar, Afghanistan.\nIt adds that Azhar was previously the leader of the terrorist group Harakat al Mujahadin, also known as Harakat ul-Ansar, and that most of these groups' members subsequently joined Jaish under Azhar's leadership.\nIn 2008, JeM recruitment posters contained a call from Azhar for volunteers to join the fight in Afghanistan against Western forces.\nThe Sanctions Committee makes its decisions by consensus of its members. However, for a resolution in the Security Council to pass, it needs nine votes in favour and no vetoes from any of its five permanent members - China, Russia, the United States, France and the UK.\nFrance, the UK and the US on February 27 moved a proposal to designate Azhar under the 1267 Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee.\nIt was under the no-objection period and Committee members had a period of 10 working days to raise any objections to the proposal.\nMore than a dozen member states had co-sponsored the proposal. About an hour before the no-objection deadline was to expire on March 13 at 3 PM, China blocked the proposal by putting a hold on it.\nIndia expressed disappointment by the outcome, saying in a statement \"this has prevented action by the international community to designate the leader of JeM, a proscribed and active terrorist organisation which has claimed responsibility for the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir on 14 February 2019\".\nMeanwhile, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made an apparent reference to China blocking the proposal to designate Azhar as a global terrorist at the UN Security Council when he said Wednesday that China abuses over a million Muslims at home, but \"protects\" violent Islamic terror groups from UN sanctions.\n\"The world cannot afford China's shameful hypocrisy toward Muslims. On one hand, China abuses more than a million Muslims at home, but on the other it protects violent Islamic terrorist groups from sanctions at the UN,\" Pompeo said in a tweet, without mentioning the JeM or the outfit's chief.\nThe February proposal was the fourth such bid at the UN in the last 10 years to list Azhar as a global terrorist.\nIn 2009, India moved a proposal by itself to designate Azhar. In 2016 again India moved the proposal with the P3 - the US, the UK and France in the UN's 1267 Sanctions Committee to ban Azhar, also the mastermind of the attack on the air base in Pathankot in January, 2016.\nIn 2017, the P3 nations moved a similar proposal again. However, on all occasions China, a veto-wielding permanent member of the Security Council, blocked the proposals from being adopted by the Sanctions Committee.\nA UNSC designation will subject Azhar to an assets freeze, travel ban and an arms embargo. An assets freeze under the Sanctions Committee requires that all states freeze without delay the funds and other financial assets or economic resources of designated individuals and entities.\nThe travel ban entails preventing the entry into or transit by all states through their territories by designated individuals.\nUnder the arms embargo, all states are required to prevent the direct or indirect supply, sale and transfer from their territories or by their nationals outside their territories, or using their flag vessels or aircraft, of arms and related materiel of all types, spare parts and technical advice, assistance or training related to military activities, to designated individuals and entities.

On Tuesday, members of the women's national soccer team said the equal pay lawsuit they filed in March against the U.S. soccer federation isn't simply about the gender pay gapbetween them and their male counterparts. According to their remarks to Reuters on Equal Pay Day, their suit is about the broader issue of how female soccer players are treated in America .\nThe team's midfielder, Megan Rapinoe, told Reuters that the lawsuit was about the \"bigger picture\" of funding throughout soccer.\n\"For us it is really important to really look at the bigger picture of the compensation piece. I don\u2019t think you can talk about compensation articulately or intelligently until you have a conversation about funding across the board,\" Rapinoe said. \"So whether that is youth teams or staffing for each team or promotion and sponsorship, you know, advertising for both teams, I don\u2019t think that that is equal yet.\"\nIn March, all 28 members of the U.S. women's soccer team filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the national soccer federation in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, according to The New York Times . It was filed just three months before the team plays the Women's World Cup in France. In their lawsuit, the plaintiffs lamented \"institutionalized gender discrimination\" that they asserted had long existed in the federation. Harry How/Getty Images Sport/Getty Images\nThe women's soccer team explained in the lawsuit in March that the issue of institutionalized gender pay gap didn't just affect their incomes; it came at the expense of soccer players' ability to pay for their medical treatments, as well as covering the fees for their training. On top of that, the gender pay gap hurt their access to playing on the professional field, the availability of the kind of transit they had to get to work, and more , according to the lawsuit.\nThat month, Rapinoe told The Times , \"I think to be on this team is to understand these issues. And I think we\u2019ve always \u2014 dating back to forever \u2014 been a team that stood up for itself and fought hard for what it felt it deserved and tried to leave the game in a better place.\"\nReuters noted that the U.S. soccer federation was \"surprised\" by the team's lawsuit. Its president, Carlos Cordeiro, released a response to the lawsuit in a statement he tweeted out in March. \"The U.S. Soccer has been and continues to be a champion for women's soccer in the U.S. and on the global stage,\" Cordeiro tweeted. He added that the federation \"believes that all female athletes deserve fair and equitable pay, and we strive to meet this core value at all times.\"\nAs the lawsuit goes on, some companies involved with soccer have tried to do some damage control. USA Today reported that the nutrition snack company, Luna Bar, said on Tuesday that a one-time payment of $31,250 would be given to each female soccer player representing the U.S. at the Women's World Cup this summer. Adidas also vowed to give women the same bonus that male players get if they won the Women's World Cup.\nBut those are one-time solutions to a problem that these players believe need broader, more consistent remedies. And if it doesn't happen now, they told Reuters that they won't give up. \"We might not see equal pay among athletes within our generation,\" the team's striker, Alex Morgan, told the news agency, \"but the hope is that the future generations will.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rapinoe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "megan rapinoe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T09:52:31.090+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "41aa23b8a6a0f48b0d8d427df4b628cda32b2691", "url": "https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/43zz9n/jordan-peele-just-revealed-the-truth-behind-that-us-ending", "site_full": "i-d.vice.com", "site": "vice.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["fashion", "style_and_fashion"], "section_title": "", "title": "jordan peele just revealed the truth behind that 'us' ending - i-D", "title_full": "jordan peele just revealed the truth behind that 'us' ending - i-D", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5ca37404101d2000072d25a3/lede/1554219798696-us-jordan-peele-lupita.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.75xh;center,center&amp;resize=1200:*", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 173, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "41aa23b8a6a0f48b0d8d427df4b628cda32b2691", "url": "https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/43zz9n/jordan-peele-just-revealed-the-truth-behind-that-us-ending", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "jordan peele just revealed the truth behind that 'us' ending - i-D", "text": "jordan peele just revealed the truth behind that 'us' ending Warning: Big Spoiler Energy TWEET\nWith Jordan Peele's latest horror magnum opus Us smashing box office records to earn the second-best opening for a live-action original film ever (Avatar is still number one somehow), it's safe to say there were a lot of people, this writer included, left scratching their heads at the film's final twist.\nThe film (SPOILERS, btw) opens with a young Adelaide Thomas happily on holiday with her parents at Santa Cruz beach, until she wanders off to a mirrored funhouse and is confronted by a creepy doppelg\u00e4nger.\nWriter and director Jordan Peele then fast-forwards us to current day, where we see a slightly unhinged adult Adelaide, portrayed expertly by Lupita Nyong'o, travelling with her own children and lovable doofus husband on a holiday to \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Santa Cruz! Things take a terrifying turn quickly, as their holiday home is invaded by an identical \"tethered\" family in red jumpsuits, armed with super sharp scissors and led by Adelaide's evil double known as \"Red\".\nWhat follows is over an hour of gory and jumpy terror, as the two families battle to the death for survival, and it is revealed that Red is, in fact, the leader of an underground identical population that have climbed up into the light to take back control of their lives from their privileged above-ground selves.\nLike any horror classic, Peele saves one last stomach-wrenching twist for the film's thrilling finale. As the audience cheers Adelaide's brutal triumph over Red, her son Jason seems unable to connect with his victorious mother and we realise that she's not quite who we think she is, as a flashback reveals that Adelaide was, in fact, the underground doppelg\u00e4nger from the fun house all along!\nUnsurprisingly, the films ending has spawned a slew of various Reddit theories and Youtube explanation videos about Adelaide and the film's wider political and metaphorical message, but honestly who could really say what any of it meant? Even writing that brief overview of the film's plot was confusing enough.\nLuckily for us, Peele himself decided it was time to step in and just appeared on the Empire Podcast tell us what in the actual fuck was going on:\n\"This movie\u2019s about maybe the monster is you. It\u2019s about us, looking at ourselves as individuals and as a group. The protagonist in the movie is the surrogate for the audience, so it felt like at the end of the day, I wasn\u2019t doing my core theme any justice if I wasn\u2019t revealing that we have been the bad guy in this movie. We\u2019ve been following the villain. I say villain lightly because I think there are many experiences of the film, and I think a lot of people go through a question of what is good and evil? Does that even exist? Both characters are lovable and terrifying, based on the lives they\u2019ve led they\u2019ve just sort of inverted the paths.\"\nSo there you have it. You're a baddie! I'm a baddie too! I guess after that there's nothing to really do but take a long hard look in the mirror and collectively question our own existence like you would as you leave the bathroom at a house party at 4am on a Sunday morning.

But the 15-percent tariff that applies to all auto imports remains in place.The extended policy will be in effect until further notice, the statement of the State Council tariffs commission said. The move is an extension of a three-month temporary suspension on additional tariffs on US-made vehicles, which took effect on January 1, after Chinese and US leaders reached a 90-day trade war truce in Argentina on December 1, 2018.China imposed the additional tariffs on US cars in July and on some auto parts in September as part of its retaliation against the US in the trade war.\"The prolonged policy shows the positive gestures China has taken in facilitating bilateral trade talks. It also indicates that certain progress has been made during the ongoing consultations. Otherwise, China would not be willing to renew the suspension,\" Bai Ming, an analyst at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times on Sunday.He also urged the US to take a similar conciliatory approach as China has done to reach a trade deal. Chinese and US trade negotiators wrapped up the latest round of trade talks in Beijing from Thursday to Friday, with US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin saying they had been \"constructive,\" the Associated Press reported. A Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier Liu He will arrive in Washington for a fresh round of trade talks this week.

The assault could intensify if politicians in Washington see weakness in China's resolve to fight back.Recognizing the true intentions of US politicians, which are to prevent China's economy from catching up with and outpacing that of the US, the world's second-largest economy is seeking genuine and faithful partners in Eurasia, Africa and South America.In the coming months and years, Beijing will open its arms to European economies, Russia, Japan, and less-developed countries around the world through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to integrate with them economically. By constantly investing in basic infrastructure, manufacturing and high-tech projects in countries along BRI route, China could extend trade and investment transactions, and its partner economies will see marked improvement in transportation, power supply, utilities, 4G and 5G facilities, as well as more jobs and higher incomes. When that time arrives, China could tilt more toward its BRI partners and move away from North America, which is trying to push China away. As a benign economic and technological powerhouse, China is seen as a genuine business partner by BRI countries because China's investments do not come with any political conditions attached. In recent years, more countries have awakened to find China is neither a strategic competitor nor a rival, but a business partner that brings jobs, revenue streams, and economic miracles.But politicians in North America are loath to see China's meteoric rise in economic strength, even though without China's massive growth, their economies might remain in the doldrums. China's exponential economic growth has been a major driver of global growth since 2000 and has contributed proportionately to the US economy over the years. In fact, China's massive stimulus spending propped up the US and significantly helped it leave the dreadful 2008-09 financial crisis behind, which Wall Street caused in the first place.However, Washington has not reciprocated Beijing's contributions. On the contrary, it has even traded China's generosity with stinginess, and its kindness with animosity. By trumpeting \"America First,\" the US government is seeking self-interest and sacrificing others, including some of its traditional allies. The US has reneged on its past global commitments and abandoned a slew of international treaties and global organizations. Among them, the scrapping of the Paris Climate Agreement and the six-nation nuclear deal with Iran have had the most destructive impact on global peace and sustainable development. Many observers say the current US government treats traditional European powers as vassals, and time and again Washington has shown its teeth and claws. In mid-February at the Munich security conference, US Vice President Mike Pence went too far by ordering European countries to withdraw from the Iranian nuclear deal and to stop \"undermining\" US sanctions on Tehran. If they disobeyed, EU companies would be penalized by Washington.The Trump administration has also been on the offensive in thwarting economic cooperation and integration of China and the EU, two of the world's heavyweight economies. The recent decision by Italy to join the BRI has irked American politicians. Nevertheless, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's cabinet was quick to hit back. Asked by American reporters why Italy decided to participate in the BRI, Luigi di Maio, Italian minister of economic development, said bluntly: \"Like someone in the United States said 'America first,' I continue to repeat: 'Italy first' in commercial relations.\" From the angle of China's promised investment to upgrade Italian ports, those rundown ports, once modernized, will revive Italy's traditional role as a key maritime link in trade between the East and the West. Most annoying for European government leaders are the intermittent warnings from US officials against choosing Chinese ICT (information and communication technology) giant Huawei to help roll out fifth-generation (5G) superfast wireless networks. The US isn't even home to any ICT equipment vendors, so it is apparent that Washington's assault against Huawei aims at diminishing China's technological competitiveness. But not every European country seems truly willing to cave to Washington's pressure and sacrifice the benefits to their own people, because Europeans, just like the Chinese, are entitled to enjoy the most advanced mobile technology and services that Huawei's gear will bring.

Brenda Villa, Heather Petri and company disappeared right after they checked in.\nKrikorian was looking around when he figured out what happened. His players had retreated to the lounges reserved for more experienced travelers.\n\u201cA couple of them came out and it was like, I felt like a rookie,\u201d Krikorian said. \u201cI felt like I was at spring training as a baseball player as a rookie trying to just learn the little subtleties of being part of the team. So those little things are I think the things that I remember most.\u201d\nKrikorian learned his way around pretty quickly. A few weeks later, he coached the U.S. to the 2009 world title.\nIn some ways, the world is still trying to catch up.\nFour days after his 10th anniversary as national team coach, Krikorian guided the U.S. to gold at the FINA Intercontinental Tournament for the second straight year. Playing without Maggie Steffens after the captain got hurt in the semifinals, the U.S. got two goals apiece from Stefania Haralabidis, Kiley Neushul and Kaleigh Gilchrist in a dramatic 14-12 shootout victory over rival Australia in Perth on Sunday.\nSteffens, the MVP of the past two Olympics, was held out after Krikorian said she was \u201con the wrong end of a cheap shot\u201d in Saturday\u2019s 14-7 victory over Canada \u2014 something he said has been happening more and more as the U.S. piles up international titles.\n\u201cI think people look at it as an opportunity to try to intimidate or do anything they can to kind of get us off our game and obviously that hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d he said Monday in a phone interview.\n\u201cI mean we\u2019re looking at probably somewhere upward of 10, 11, 12 just direct shots out of the water to our kids.\u201d\nKrikorian, 44, played at UCLA and coached the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams for the Bruins before taking over the U.S. women\u2019s program.\nWith Krikorian on the pool deck, the U.S. has enjoyed an unprecedented run on top of the sport. It became the first country to win two straight Olympics titles when it rolled over the field in Rio in 2016.\nIt currently holds every major women\u2019s water polo championship and will be a heavy favorite to win a third straight world title in South Korea in July.\nKrikorian has come a long way since that first trip.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m calmer, No. 1, and I think that\u2019s largely because of the perspective I have,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think my competitiveness has died down, but I realize this is not the end all to life.\n\u201cI think maybe when I first began it was, you get so caught up in winning and losing and I\u2019ve become much more process-oriented and I have a better perspective on things.\u201d\nTokyo will be Krikorian\u2019s third Olympics. He said he hasn\u2019t thought about his future beyond that point.\nWhile he wants to make sure he is continually challenged, Krikorian also is appreciative of his current position.\n\u201cThere is just nothing like being part of a team in sports,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s just nothing like it. There\u2019s the passion, the energy, the camaraderie, the connection and the relationships that you build.

Bell went on to found the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (known today as AT&T), which became one of the world's largest telecommunications firms. But as 2020 draws near and the world is on the cusp of ultra-fast 5G networks, the US has found itself without a telecommunications hardware champion that can compete with major 5G players such as China's Huawei Technologies, Finland's Nokia and Sweden 's Ericsson. The fifth-generation wireless networks are expected to revolutionise everything from the internet of things to autonomous driving and virtual reality, with billions of dollars in economic benefit brought to countries that are able to keep up with the technology. Instead, in recent years the US has clashed with China on trade and tech issues and moved to discourage other countries from using Huawei's 5G gear in their networks, in the hopes that the equipment can be supplied by companies from friendlier nations. The US has accused Huawei of ties to the Chinese government and warned allies that its equipment could be used for Chinese intelligence - claims that Huawei strenuously denies. Guo Ping, rotating chairman at Huawei, in turn recently taunted the US as a \"sore loser\" whose attempts to restrain Huawei were like \"abandoning all table manners\". Pressure from the US on its allies has mostly fallen on deaf ears - last month, the European Commission refused to ban Huawei outright, telling members that they were responsible for assessing network risks. But as the US continues its battle against Huawei, it is also anxious about keeping up in technology innovation. In February, the US Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing titled \"Winning the Race to 5G and the Era of Technology Innovation in the United States\", to discuss what policies are required to accelerate the deployment of 5G to keep America \"competitive on the international Huawei challenges rivals to open their source codes for testing \"To realise all of these benefits fully, US must win the global race to 5G,\" said Roger Wicker, US senator and chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. \"Failing to win the race in 5G ... will forever reduce the economic and societal gains from leading the world in technology.\" In the absence of a local 5G equipment champion, US telcos, including AT&T, Verizon and Sprint have announced they will be working with Nokia and Ericsson and South Korea 's Samsung as their 5G suppliers. How exactly did the US go from being the leader of modern telephony to also-ran within a matter of decades, allowing a Chinese company to become the 5G leader today? Experts and former employees in the telecommunications industry in the US point to the confluence of several factors that ultimately led to the downfall of the US telecoms industry, including the lack of national mobile standards and deregulation of the industry in 1996. Europe had already mandated the use of the GSM mobile network standard in 1987. US regulators, however, allowed carriers to go with whatever mobile standard they preferred. US carriers Verizon and Sprint chose to offer services using the CDMA transmission standard, developed by US firm Motorola - which operates on different frequencies than GSM, which AT&T and T-Mobile adopted. UK chides Huawei for security flaws, but rules out Chinese state interference Consumers who subscribed to a Verizon carrier, for example, would likely have to switch handsets if they wanted to change providers as a device configured for CDMA might not run on a network supporting GSM. \"In the US there were wireless networks like TDMA, CDMA and GSM, and any carrier could choose any of those if they thought that it would be best for their own growth plan ... the US was like the Wild West,\" said Thomas J. Lauria, a former AT&T employee, telecoms analyst as well as the author of the book The Fall of Telecom . \"Europe managed itself more contiguously than the US, they did not have a lot of disparate networks and picked the [GSM] standard that everyone had to agree to.\" The existence of multiple transmissions standards in one market was further encouraged by the deregulation of the US industry under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, in which the US opened up the market, removing the monopoly that AT&T had on phone services and allowing smaller carriers to sprout. The entry of multiple service providers, all of whom were free to adopt different standards, was at the beginning viewed as beneficial for consumers and the industry as a whole. AT&T spun off its equipment division into what became known as Lucent Technologies, which thereafter listed on the New York Stock Exchange and raised US$3 billion in its initial public offering - then the largest ever in American history. Lucent's revenues grew rapidly by providing new entrants with networking equipment, and initially offered a variety of products compatible with different transmission standards, including CDMA, TDMA, GSM and AMPS. But multiple standards also meant that it was difficult to achieve economies of scale, so Lucent eventually bet on CDMA and UMTS (as opposed to WCDMA, which was adopted by much of the rest of the world) - neither of which took off in Europe and most of Asia, costing it expansion opportunities in international markets. US braces for 5G world largely built with gear from China's Huawei \"The US vendors were not convinced that GSM would become a global standard,\" said Bengt Nordstrom, chief executive of Stockholm-based consultancy Northstream. \"Instead, they supported all the technical standards in the US for their customers there. In many aspects, the era from the early 1990s to mid 2000s was lost time for the US mobile industry.\" \"From a US perspective and mentality, it is hard to understand why a technology not coming from the US should be better,\" he added. After the initial boom in the mobile industry following deregulation, the telecommunications industry began to decline from 2001 as growth started to plateau for both large and small mobile carriers. Investors also decided to bet on more established companies after some stock market uncertainty, and some smaller carriers went bust. For equipment providers like Lucent and Motorola, which had provided financing to some customers to buy equipment - a common industry practice - the slowdown hit hard. Some carriers were unable to make repayments on time, adversely impacting balance sheets on both sides. In one case, Lucent had to write off US$700 million in bad debts after providing US$2 billion in financing to WinStar Wireless, which went bankrupt in 2001. Ardern makes progress in China, but does Huawei have cause for optimism? Lucent was also brought down by a string of mergers and acquisitions that it did not successfully integrate into the business. Eventually, the US company merged with France's Alcatel to become Alcatel-Lucent in 2006. A decade later, Nokia acquired Alcatel-Lucent and merged it into its Nokia Networks division. Motorola, which like Lucent was once a major US network equipment maker, eventually also had its wireless network infrastructure assets acquired by Nokia. It was around the same time that Huawei, then a scrappy upstart based out of Shenzhen, was able to expand globally, initially offering its networking equipment at cheaper prices to international customers in emerging countries as a way to gain a foothold outside China. By focusing on customer service and investing heavily in research and development, Huawei has today established itself as one of the major equipment providers for 5G. To be sure, the US still has a major telecommunications firm - Cisco Systems , with sales of US$49.3 billion in 2018 compared to US$100 billion for Huawei, which includes sales of its own brand smartphones. How supporters of China and Huawei are barking up the wrong tree However, most of Cisco's sales come from providing infrastructure platforms for enterprise customers, whereas Huawei, Nokia and Ericsson provide equipment for core telecommunications networks. \"I look back on it with sadness, that we had these great, large manufacturers and now I can't even find them on the map,\" said Lauria, the telecoms analyst who had worked for AT&T. \"It's sad, as an American, looking at it and thinking, 'What happened to our industry?'\" \"We created it, we built it, and we exported it - now people aren't really focused on the innovation that we did. Instead they remember us for our downfall.\" This article originally appeared on the South China Morning Post (SCMP) , the leading news media reporting on China and Asia.

The aircraft is built by Lockheed Martin Corp.\nA Pentagon official had told Reuters in March that the United States had a number of items it could withhold in order to send Turkey a signal that the United States was serious about Ankara dropping its ambition to own the S-400.\nTurkish officials in Ankara were not immediately available for comment. Turkey has said it will take delivery of the S-400s in July.\nNATO SUMMIT\nThe US decision on the F-35s was expected to complicate Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu`s visit to Washington this week for a NATO summit. On Sunday, Erdogan suffered one of his biggest electoral losses in decades in local elections.\n\"Certain Russian weapon systems are seen as inherently threatening to the United States regardless of who is operating them and for what purpose,\" Andrew Hunter, a fellow at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said.\n\"Because Turkey is not just an F-35 purchaser, but an industrial partner, blocking delivery of these systems represents a major escalation by the United States as it threatens to impose serious costs on both sides,\" Hunter said.\nReuters reported last week that Washington was exploring whether it could remove Turkey from production of the F-35. Turkey makes parts of the fuselage, landing gear and cockpit displays. Sources familiar with the F-35`s intricate worldwide production process and U.S. thinking on the issue last week said Turkey`s role can be replaced.\nThe United States and other NATO allies that own F-35s fear the radar on the Russian S-400 missile system will learn how to spot and track the jet, making it less able to evade Russian weapons.\nIn an attempt to persuade Turkey to drop its plans to buy the S-400, the United States offered the pricier American-made Patriot anti-missile system in a discounted deal that expired at the end of March. Turkey has\nshown interest in the Patriot system, but not at the expense of abandoning the S-400.\nTurkey has engaged with US negotiators in recent days about buying the Patriot system, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The system is made by Raytheon Co.\nTurkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar in March said that despite some issues, Turkish pilots were continuing their training at an air base in Arizona on the F-35, each of which costs $90 million, and that Ankara was expecting the aircraft to arrive in Turkey in November.\nBy halting jet deliveries, the Pentagon could subsequently delay training of Turkish pilots. Two additional jets are scheduled to arrive in Arizona in April and a significant delay could impact Turkey`s November target date for operations.\nUS lawmakers also have expressed alarm over Turkey`s planned purchase of the Russian system. Four US senators last week introduced a bipartisan bill that would prohibit the transfer of F-35s to Turkey until the U.S. government certifies that Ankara will not take delivery of the S-400 system.\nFollowing news of the halt, US Senator Jeanne Shaheen, one of the bill sponsors, said she was glad to hear the administration was \"to delay the transfer of F-35 equipment to Turkey to help ensure U.S. military technology and capabilities cannot fall into the hands of the Kremlin.\" Tags: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

Trending News Aamrapali Dubey's latest hilarious TikTok video is unmissable\u2014Watch\nSEOUL: South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Monday he hopes North Korea responds positively when he meets U.S. President Donald Trump this month as part of efforts to restart denuclearisation talks with the North.\nTrump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un failed to make any agreement at their summit in Hanoi in February, leaving Moon with little room to manoeuvre and exacerbating divisions within his government over how to break the impasse.\nSpeaking to his cabinet, Moon said he would use the April 11 summit in Washington to discuss restarting U.S.-North Korea talks, advancing a peace process and creating a \"virtuous cycle\" of improving relations with Pyongyang.\n\"I hope North Korea will respond positively to the efforts of Seoul and Washington,\" he said.\nThe summit in Vietnam`s capital was cut short after Trump and Kim failed to reach a deal on the extent of economic sanctions relief for North Korea in exchange for its steps to give up its nuclear programme.\nThough there have been no signs of any return to U.S.-North Korea talks, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: \"I would hope in the coming months our two leaders will be back together ... in a way that we can achieve a substantive first step or a substantive big step along the path to denuclearization.\"\nPompeo added, however, that it is \"hard to know what the timing will be,\" according to a newly released State Department transcript of an interview on Friday with Pennsylvania radio station WHP, when asked how long the process would take.\nThere was criticism in Washington that Seoul might have over-sold Kim\u2019s denuclearisation commitment and gone too far in pushing for sanctions relief, while Moon`s advisers have said the United States cannot stick to an \"all or nothing\" approach when trying to strike a deal over North Korea`s nuclear weapons programme.\nBut Moon said the allies are \"very much on the same page when it comes to our shared objective of achieving complete denuclearisation and establishing a permanent peace regime on the Korean peninsula\".\nHe criticised unnamed sceptics who he said had tried to \"drive a wedge\" between Seoul and Washington and \"reverse the tide of peace\".\n\"This is in no way helpful to our national interest or the future of the Korean peninsula,\" Moon said. \"Such attempts can be labelled truly irresponsible, especially when we recall the state of crisis we endured before dialogue was launched.\"\nThe failure of the Hanoi summit created \"temporary difficulties\" but \"it is becoming clear that neither the two Koreas nor the United States wants to go back to the past,\" he said.\nNorth Korea for years pursued nuclear and missile programmes in defiance of U.N.

Image Courtesy: Reuters Apr 01, 2019, 20:59 PM IST Source: Reuters Trending News Aamrapali Dubey's latest hilarious TikTok video is unmissable\u2014Watch\nWASHINGTON: The Democratic-led U.S. House Judiciary Committee said it will vote on Wednesday on whether to authorize subpoenas to obtain Special Counsel Robert Mueller`s full report investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\nLawmakers will also consider subpoenas for underlying evidence from Mueller`s investigation and from five former aides to President Donald Trump, including White House counsel Donald McGahn and political adviser Steve Bannon. The committee said on Monday that they may have documents related to the Mueller probe.\nDemocrats have become increasingly frustrated over U.S. Attorney General William Barr`s plan to share only a redacted copy of the nearly 400-page investigative report with Congress. The committee will vote on a resolution to allow House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler to issue subpoenas at his own discretion.\nThe Mueller report describes his office`s 22-month probe, which did not find evidence of collusion between Trump`s campaign and Russia but also did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice, according to a four-page summary Barr released on March 24.\nBarr said Mueller`s team had not found enough proof to warrant bringing obstruction charges against the president.\nTrump and the White House have hailed the conclusions as a victory for the president. But Democrats have taken issue with Barr`s intervention.\n\"Congress, not the attorney general, has a duty under the Constitution to determine whether wrongdoing has occurred,\" Nadler wrote in a New York Times Op-Ed on Monday.\n\"It is not the attorney general`s job to step in and substitute his judgment for the special counsel`s. That responsibility falls to Congress \u2014 and specifically to the House Judiciary Committee \u2014 as it has in every similar investigation in modern history.\"\nA week ago, Nadler and the Democratic heads of five other House committees gave Barr until Tuesday to provide the full Mueller report and underlying evidence. Barr said he would issue his redacted version by mid-April or sooner.\nTrump on Monday took aim at Democrats in the aftermath of the Mueller probe. \"Now that the long awaited Mueller Report conclusions have been released, most Democrats and others have gone back to the pre-Witch Hunt phase of their lives before Collusion Delusion took over. Others are pretending that their former hero, Bob Mueller, no longer exists!\" the president said on Twitter.\nRepublicans on the judiciary panel say Congress does not need the unredacted Mueller report to do its job and accuse Democrats of setting arbitrary deadlines as part of a partisan campaign to undermine Trump ahead of the 2020 election.\n\"The attorney general has already demonstrated transparency above and beyond what is required,\" Representative Doug Collins, the top Republican on the judiciary committee, said in a statement.\nBut Democrats say Republicans helped set a precedent for Congress to obtain underlying investigative material during their investigation into Democrat Hillary Clinton`s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.\nThe committee said the Justice Department gave Congress more than 880,000 pages of internal investigative records from the Clinton probe as well as classified and sensitive law enforcement information from an early Russia probe that Mueller took over.\nIn addition to McGahn and Bannon, the committee will consider subpoenas for former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks, former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and former White House deputy counsel Ann Donaldson.\nThe five former Trump aides were among 81 individuals, agencies and other entities that received document requests on March 4 as part of the committee`s obstruction and corruption investigation of Trump and his associates.

The nuclear-armed neighbours both said they had shot down each other`s fighter jets last month.\nThe United States, Britain and France initially asked the Security Council`s Islamic State and al-Qaeda sanctions committee, which operates by consensus, to blacklist Azhar. However, China prevented the move.\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said that China had conducted a \"comprehensive and thorough evaluation\" but still needed more time to consider the proposal. China had previously prevented the committee from sanctioning Azhar in 2016 and 2017.\nInstead of consensus, a resolution only needs nine votes in favour and no vetoes by China, Russia, the United States, France or Britain to pass. It was not immediately clear when the draft resolution to designate Azhar could be put to a vote.\nThe Chinese mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the draft text.\nJeM is a primarily anti-India group that forged ties with al Qaeda and was blacklisted by the UN Security Council in 2001. In December 2001, Jaish fighters, along with members of another Pakistan-based militant group, Lashkar-e-Taiba, attacked India`s parliament, which almost led to a fourth war between the two countries.

This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and \u201ctalk.\u201d Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019 Although the president called the closing a \"good thing,\" a border shutdown would have implications way beyond immigration matters. For months, economists have warned that closing the border could gravely affect American access to fresh produce imported into the country. That shortage would most likely be felt by avocado lovers, as the U.S. imports about 80 percent of its total avocado supply from Mexico. That means goodbye creamy morsels of heart-healthy fats . Adios gorgeous guacamole . See you later wonderfully trendy \u2014 if not slightly overrated \u2014 avocado toast. Well, it's goodbye at least for a little while. Nathan Congleton / TODAY Avocado Toast with Poached Eggs Geoffrey Zakarian Steve Barnard, chief executive and president of Mission Produce , the largest grower and distributer of avocados in the world, said Americans could run out of avocados in as little as three weeks following a shutdown at the border, Reuters reported. \"We would be out of business for a while,\u201d Barnard said. In March 2018, Barnard told The New York Times that his company was \"scrambling\" to keep up with America's booming desire for the creamy green fruit. Since the early 2000s, the company has grown between 10 to 15 percent each year to meet the rising demand. But if Trump is able to execute a shutdown, Mission Produce wouldn't be scrambling; they'd simply be unable to supply the U.S. at all. Related Do you really need to wash avocados? This FDA warning is surprising home cooks But is the situation really that dire? Though Mexico is the largest U.S. supplier of avocados, about 10 percent of all imported avocados come from other countries, including Peru, Chile and the Dominican Republic. A border shutdown would not impact those imports. In California, which is the largest producer of domestic avocados, the harvesting season does not last throughout the entire year (in Mexico's temperate climate, avocados are grown and harvested year round). Domestic avocados likely won't be available until late spring or early summer \u2014 and if they're in high demand, they'll be a lot more expensive. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t pick a worse time of year because Mexico supplies virtually 100 percent of the avocados in the U.S. right now. California is just starting and they have a very small crop, but they\u2019re not relevant right now and won\u2019t be for another month or so,\u201d Barnard told Reuters. According to the California Avocado Commission , less than 1 percent of the state's soil is actually fertile for avocados, which take 14 to 18 months to grow. That means an unexpected surge in domestic demand couldn't be met for more than a year after seeds get planted. Of course, it's not just avocados that Americans should be worried about. Currently the U.S. imports about half of its vegetables and 40 percent of its fruit from Mexico. A closed border would likely mean higher prices on many grocery staples like tomatoes, cucumbers and many berries.

The website was shut down by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2018 for permitting human trafficking and money laundering.\nThe lawsuit claims the $120bn (\u00a391bn) Silicon Valley company publicly promoted its work with human trafficking charities while quietly profiting from the classified listings website.\nSalesforce first entered into a contract with Backpage.com in 2013.

The Breakthrough Therapy Designation acknowledges the significant unmet need of these patients and the potential benefit of selumetinib in this setting.\u201d\nRoy Baynes, Senior Vice President and Head of Global Clinical Development, Chief Medical Officer, at Merck Research Laboratories, said: \u201cThis new designation validates our ongoing development of selumetinib. As a result of this, selumetinib has the potential to receive expedited regulatory review and we hope to bring this medicine to patients as soon as possible.\u201d\nThe BTD is based on Phase II data from the SPRINT trial, testing selumetinib as an oral monotherapy in pediatric patients, aged three years or older with inoperable NF1-related PN. The results of the trial were presented by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting.\nThis is the ninth BTD that AstraZeneca has received from the FDA since 2014. A BTD is designed to expedite the development and regulatory review of medicines that are intended to treat a serious condition and that have shown encouraging early clinical results, which may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically-significant endpoint over available medicines.\nSelumetinib was granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of NF1 by the US FDA in February 2018 and the European Medicines Agency in August 2018. About Selumetinib\nSelumetinib is a MEK 1/2 inhibitor and potential new medicine licensed by AstraZeneca from Array BioPharma Inc. in 2003. AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, entered a co-development and co-commercialization agreement for selumetinib in 2017.\nThe NF1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called neurofibromin, which negatively regulates the RAS/MAPK pathway, helping to control cell growth, differentiation and survival. Mutations in the NF1 gene may result in dysregulations in RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling, which can cause cells to grow, divide and copy themselves in an uncontrolled manner, and may result in tumor growth. Selumetinib inhibits the MEK enzyme in this pathway, potentially leading to inhibition of tumor growth.\nSelumetinib is being assessed as a monotherapy and in combination with other treatments in ongoing clinical trials. About SPRINT\nThe SPRINT trial is a US Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) NCI-sponsored Phase I/II trial. The Phase I trial was designed to identify the optimal Phase II dosing regimen, and the results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. About NF1\nNeurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an incurable genetic condition that affects one in 3,000 to 4,000 individuals in the U.S. It is caused by a spontaneous or inherited mutation in the NF1 gene and is associated with many symptoms, including soft lumps on and under the skin (cutaneous neurofibromas), skin pigmentation (so-called \u2018cafe au lait\u2019 spots) and, in 20-50% of patients, tumors develop on the nerve sheaths (plexiform neurofibromas). These plexiform neurofibromas can cause clinical complications such as pain, motor dysfunction, airway dysfunction, bowel/bladder dysfunction and disfigurement as well as having the potential to transform into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST).\nPeople with NF1 may experience a number of complications such as learning difficulties, visual impairment, twisting and curvature of the spine, high blood pressure, and epilepsy. NF1 also increases a person\u2019s risk of developing other cancers, including malignant brain tumors, MPNST and leukemia. Symptoms begin during early childhood, with varying degrees of severity, and can reduce life expectancy by up to 15 years. About the AstraZeneca and the Merck Oncology Collaboration\nIn July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialize LYNPARZA (olaparib), the world\u2019s first PARP inhibitor and potential new medicine selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop LYNPARZA and selumetinib in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop LYNPARZA and selumetinib in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines. About AstraZeneca in Oncology\nAstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in Oncology and offers a quickly-growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients\u2019 lives and the Company\u2019s future. With at least six new medicines to be launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, we are committed to advance New Oncology as one of AstraZeneca\u2019s five Growth Platforms focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers. In addition to our core capabilities, we actively pursue innovative partnerships and investments that accelerate the delivery of our strategy, as illustrated by our investment in Acerta Pharma in hematology.\nBy harnessing the power of four scientific platforms \u2013 Immuno-Oncology, Tumor Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response and Antibody Drug Conjugates \u2013 and by championing the development of personalized combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and one day eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

The Chevrolet Cavalier, which ran from 1982 to 2005, lived a hard life. Originally intended as an upmarket, domestic alternative to cars like the Honda Accord, the Cavalier was hamstrung by a botched launch.\nResearch Make (e.g. Cadillac) Acura Alfa Romeo AM General Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Buick Cadillac Chevrolet Chrysler Daewoo Dodge Eagle Ferrari Fiat Fisker Ford Freightliner Genesis Geo GMC Honda Hummer Hyundai Infiniti Isuzu Jaguar Jeep Karma Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lincoln Lotus Maserati Maybach Mazda McLaren Mercedes-Benz Mercury MINI Mitsubishi Nissan Oldsmobile Plymouth Pontiac Porsche Ram Rolls-Royce Saab Saturn Scion smart SRT Subaru Suzuki Tesla Toyota Volkswagen Volvo The 1982 model's wheezy, carbureted 1.8 liter four cylinder lacked refinement, and it made the whole car seem cheap. While the engine was replaced the very next year with a smoother fuel-injected 2.0 liter, the damage was done.\nAs a result, the Cavalier quickly became an also-ran, never being afforded the chance to stand on its own merits. If you counted all of the times General Motors shot themselves in the foot back in the 1980s [and before (and since)], they wouldn't have any toes left.\nFor its entire run, the Cavalier became the unofficial car for Midwesterners who pined for an import, but lived with the sort of relatives who forbade anything not built by the UAW to take up residence in their driveway. Despite a few bright spots (the first-gen Z24 with the 2.8 liter V6, for example), product planners seemed to accept this role with increasing apathy. When the Cavalier was replaced in 2005 by the marginally better Cobalt, it was not missed by many.\nOur friends over at The Drive have discovered that General Motors has once again applied for the Cavalier nameplate in the United States. This is bizarre news for a lot of reasons.\nAlong with the sort of baggage the Cavalier name carries, General Motors just closed the Lordstown, Ohio assembly plant that built the Cavalier. GM had a long history of building Chevy small cars there, starting with the Vega, followed by the Monza, then the Cavalier, Cobalt, and, most recently, the Cruze.\nCall us cynical, but this seems like just another slap in the face to the embattled former employees of Lordstown Assembly. In fact, we're already waiting for the other shoe to drop.\nChevrolet currently offers a compact car badged as the Cavalier in China and Mexico. Within the next few weeks, we wouldn't be surprised to learn that Chevrolet is planning on selling that car here to replace the Cruze.

Will the positive momentum continue on Tuesday? Currently, the pair is trading at 1.3316, up 0.07% on the day. On the release front, there are no Canadian events. In the U.S., core durable goods orders is expected to improve to 0.3%, while durable goods orders is forecast to plunge 1.1%. On Wednesday, the U.S. publishes ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI and ADP (NASDAQ: ADP ) nonfarm payrolls.\nThe Canadian dollar ended last week with strong gains, as Canada\u2019s GDP posted a gain of 0.3% in January. This beat the estimate and came after two successive declines, which has raised concerns about the health of the Canadian economy. The slowdown in the fourth quarter has forced the Bank of Canada to turn more dovish and shelve any plans of hiking interest rates. There have even been calls for a rate cut from the bank, but the GDP gain in January will lessen the pressure on the BoC to stimulate the economy.\nPositive data out of China this week has also boosted the fortunes of the Canadian dollar. Investor risk appetite has risen following a key manufacturing report that was better than expected. Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI improved to 50.8, easily beating the estimate of 50.1 points. Investors cheered as the indicator climbed to an 8-month high, after three successive readings in contraction territory. The Chinese economy has been hit hard by the trade war with the U.S., and a piece of good news sparked strong gains on the equity markets and boosted the Canadian dollar.\nUSD/CAD Fundamentals\nWednesday (April 3)\n8:15 US ADP Nonfarm Employment Change.

The University of Arizona is facing criticism for its to decision to criminally charge two students for protesting an appearance of US border patrol officers at a campus event.\nDenisse Moreno Melchor, 20, and Mariel Alexandra Bustamante, 22, allegedly disrupted an appearance of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) representatives at the university on 19 March. Both students were issued misdemeanor citations for \u201cinterference with the peaceful conduct of an educational institution\u201d and Melchor was also cited for \u201cthreats and intimidation\u201d, a university spokesman said on Tuesday. The charges could carry up to six months of jail time .\nSign up for the US morning briefing The decision by university police to bring criminal charges over a non-violent demonstration has sparked a backlash from lawmakers, free speech advocates and immigrant rights\u2019 groups.\n\u201cThey\u2019re making an example out of these students, and they are trying to ensure nobody will follow in their footsteps,\u201d Arizona state senator Mart\u00edn Quezada told the Guardian. \u201cThe students should have the ability to express their opinions about what the government is doing,\u201d he added.\nThe border patrol agents had come to campus for a presentation at a student club event. A group of protesters chanted outside the meeting, calling the agents \u201cmurderers\u201d and shouting \u201cmurder patrol\u201d, the Arizona Republic reported .\n'Inhuman' wall of razor wire on Arizona-Mexico border sparks outcry Read more\nMelchor and Bustamante were charged on Monday. The students did not immediately respond to requests or comment. They were cited at the university police department and released, the spokesman, Chris Sigurdson, told the Guardian. He said the students were not accused of any violence.\nRobert C Robbins, the university president, opened his letter on the incident by saying he wanted to \u201creaffirm\u201d the university\u2019s \u201crelationship\u201d with CBP and said that the institution \u201chas policies and protocols for behavior and expression\u201d.\n\u201cThe student club and the CBP officers invited by the students should have been able to hold their meeting without disruption. Student protest is protected by our support for free speech, but disruption is not,\u201d he added.\nHe further wrote: \u201cAs a community of scholars, we need to be more thoughtful and deliberative in how we approach these issues.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s unclear how the student protests of the border patrol officers would have violated free speech protections.\nState senator Quezada said he was disappointed to see the charges, and that the university was \u201cdoing a lot of harm to these young individuals who have bright futures ahead of them\u201d.\nIn recent years, there have been increasingly heated debates about free speech and protest activity on college campuses in America. Universities have repeatedly come under fire for allowing far-right figures to speak on campus and then aggressively targeting counterprotesters.\nProtests against border patrol have also escalated across the country surrounding Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant agenda, including the family separation crisis, the detention of children , deaths of migrants in custody and alleged sexual assaults by agents .\nArizona: Four women convicted after leaving food and water in desert for migrants Read more\nThe student government association at the University of Arizona said that the presence of uniformed agents was troubling for many students.

Years before Tottenham Hotspur Stadium started rising like a spaceship in a north London neighborhood needing regeneration, planning on how to finance it was under way nearly 3,500 miles away. (AP Photo/Matt Dunham, File)\nYears before Tottenham Hotspur Stadium started rising like a spaceship in north London, planning on how to finance the structure was underway nearly 3,500 miles away.\nIn a glass tower near the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan, Greg Carey and his team at Goldman Sachs worked with Tottenham to finance $828 million (637 million pounds) of the project, which is expected to cost well over $1 billion. Club owners hope it will pay for itself and produce enough cash to help Spurs buy superstars so the club can compete at the top level of European soccer. That means more than selling the 62,062 seats for English Premier League matches.\nClub officials and the banks backing them say millions more will come in from hospitality, broadcast, sponsorship, merchandising, concessions, advertising and digital rights \u2014 the types of revenue that bankrolled America&apos;s stadium boom over the past decade.\nEven at soccer&apos;s highest level, you must spend money to make money.\n\"Before starting the financing we had discussed project finance with Greg and walked through a number of models and ways to securitize revenues and best approaches,\" said Matthew Collecott, Tottenham&apos;s operations and finance director. \"Was useful to understand what the market was doing in terms of available methods of finance, stripping out revenue streams to securitize, mix of offerings and modeling.\"\nGoldman has worked to finance more than three dozen sports projects, and Tottenham&apos;s is among the most prominent. The stadium opens Wednesday with a Premier League match against Crystal Palace. The opening was postponed seven times, a delay of nearly eight months that caused 14 of this season&apos;s 19 league home matches to be moved to Wembley, the home of England&apos;s national team,\nAdvertisement\nSpurs played from 1899 through May 2017 at White Hart Lane, which had a capacity of 36,310 before a corner was torn down ahead of its final season to allow work to start. The new stadium&apos;s 120,000-square meter (143,000-square yard) footprint is four times the size of the old. Features include a single-bank 17,500-seat south stand, Britain&apos;s largest, which sits above a plaque marking the center circle of the old field. The stadium is topped by the club&apos;s symbol, a 15-foot (4.6 meter) Golden Cockerel , twice the height of the original.\nTottenham is in the relatively poor Borough of Haringey, the site of rioting in 2011. The stadium is part of a redevelopment project that includes 222 homes designed as affordable housing and a new school.\nWhite Hart Lane had claustrophobic corridors, cramped seats and concession choices limited mostly to fish and chips, beer and water. The new stadium, designed by Populous, usually will open two hours before kickoff (three hours for luxury seating) and is the first in British soccer with the myriad of food offerings common in U.S. venues, 60 food and drink outlets, all with cashless payments, that include a Beavertown microbrewery. Spurs established several new \"largests\" for a European stadium: a 65-meter (71-yard) bar along the goal line, two of the four video boards and a 23,000-square foot retail store.\nTottenham has a deal to host two NFL games each season, and the grass field on 99 steel trays retracts below the south stand on 2,090 rails to reveal artificial turf underneath.\n\"It&apos;s this escalation for Champions League,\" said Carey, a Goldman managing director. \"It all comes down to how much money you have to buy, and these stadiums are going to not only pay for the investment in that stadium but produce excess cash flow which is going to go back into buying players.\"\nTottenham reached a 200 million pound financing agreement in December 2015 with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and HSBC, replaced it in May 2017 for 400 million pounds and said last October the amount had increased to 637 million pounds (currently $828 million) with an April 2022 expiration. Spurs, plans to convert the debt into notes with a mix of maturities.\nSpurs have not signed any transfers this season, but club executive chairman Daniel Levy told the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters&apos; Trust on March 12 \"the net spend on players would not be affected\" by stadium costs.\nTottenham hasn&apos;t won the English title since 1961 but finished among the top three in each of the last three seasons. The team is fourth this year, and plays Manchester City in the Champions League quarterfinals next week.\nArsenal moved in the 2006-07 season from 38,419-seat Highbury to 60,260-seat Emirates Stadium, but the new venue has not translated into a league or European championship.\n\"An old stadium with limited facilities built over decades had to be replaced with what we have delivered to ensure the long-term growth of the club and for future generations of fans,\" Collecott said.\nSpurs felt the new venue \u2014 a naming-rights agreement has not yet been reached \u2014 was key to future success. But they have kept the fans close to the field, unlike at some of the newer stadiums. The distance between the stands and the touchline is 4.9 meters (5\u00bd yards) behind the goals, down from 13.5 meters (14\u00be yards) at Emirates and 18 meters (19\u00bd yards) at Olympic Stadium, where West Ham moved for the 2016-17 season.\nGoldman&apos;s projects include new Yankee Stadium, the Brooklyn Nets&apos; Barclays Center, MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, the Minnesota Twins&apos; Target Field, the Minnesota Vikings&apos; U.S. Bank Stadium, the Orlando Magic&apos;s Amway Center, Los Angeles Football Club&apos;s Banc of California Stadium and D.C. United&apos;s Audi Field.\nCarey&apos;s group is working on contemplated stadiums for Roma, Inter Milan and the Dutch club Feyenoord. He advises the Oakland Athletics and Tampa Bay Rays, the two Major League Baseball teams most in need of new stadiums.\n\"They know how to be creative using you know different resources available,\" said Melanie Lenz, the Rays&apos; chief development officer. \"A trusted adviser to help us understand what options could be available within the Tampa Bay market.\"\nCarey views the structure as similar to financing a road or a port.\n\"There&apos;s three risks you have: construction risk, completion risk and revenue risk,\" he said. \"What we help the clubs do is eliminate those first two, how we can make sure we&apos;re going to get this thing built on time and at cost, and then we invest, we give them money or we get investors for that revenue risk. And if you take a look at the revenue projections of new stadiums or renovated stadiums, you don&apos;t miss by much.\"\n___\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer", "http://www.ap.org/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ronald blum", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dunham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg carey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tottenham hotspur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tottenham hotspur stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tottenham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spurs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tottenham stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T21:07:12.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "639f8f96aa369062a4ffb1de2b2144632249a5f1", "url": "https://www2.hm.com/en_us/life/culture/inside-h-m/hmleague-get-inspired-by-our-23-ambassadors.html", "site_full": "www2.hm.com", "site": "hm.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "#HMLeague: Get inspired by our 23 ambassadors | H&M US", "title_full": "#HMLeague: Get inspired by our 23 ambassadors | H&M US", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www2.hm.com/content/dam/hm-magazine-2019/inside-hm/19_12_T_League.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "639f8f96aa369062a4ffb1de2b2144632249a5f1", "url": "https://www2.hm.com/en_us/life/culture/inside-h-m/hmleague-get-inspired-by-our-23-ambassadors.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "#HMLeague: Get inspired by our 23 ambassadors | H&M US", "text": "INSIDE H&M #HMLeague: Get inspired by our 23 ambassadors Starting today, Brittanny Xavier, Ellen V Lora, Jessi Malay and 20 other powerful influencers are teaming up with H&M on a year-long journey.

For instance, when you're filled with energy because winter just ended and when flights are super-cheap -- in other words, right now. Southwest is throwing yet another one of its huge flight sales as of Tuesday, and you can get out of wherever you are for seriously cheap. So you should probably do that. From now until Thursday, April 11, you can get deeply discounted fares from all over the country to destinations all throughout the United States and beyond. Check out the official sale page and use the drop-down menu to find your own city from the list. The deals vary a lot from city to city, but here are some highlights: Los Angeles to San Jose (and vice versa) for $49 , Nashville to Atlanta (and vice versa) for $59 , and Phoenix to Denver (and vice versa) for $69 . If you'd rather get out of the country entirely, you can get from Ft. Lauderdale to Havana, Cuba for $111 , Dallas to Belize City, Belize for $167 , or Denver to Cancun, Mexico for $180 . Bear in mind, however, that deals this good come with fine print. First, you'll have to book before the sale ends on April 11, and your trip will have to take place between April 23 and October 31, with some pretty big gaps in the booking options for July. Make sure to check out the details at the top of the sale page for the full breakdown. On the other hand, Southwest will let you bring two bags for free, so who cares when you go: You'll be bringing your entire wardrobe with you. Also, this seems like a good time to remind you that Southwest now has cheap flights to Hawaii .

Hawaii 10. Montana WalletHub\u2019s map shows how stressed each state is using colors. The darker your state, the more stressed the people living there are. Southern states make up the top 10 for a second year in a row, with Louisiana topping the list once more. WalletHub found that people who live there average high hours worked in a week, high percentages of adults in fair or poor health, low credit scores, high divorce rates, lots of crime, and high percentages of people living in poverty. Is it any wonder people there are stressed out? Other extremely stressed states, like Alaska , Kentucky , Mississippi , and West Virginia ranked high in the same things. While some of the states ranked as the least stressed, like North Dakota and Hawaii , were among the places with the lowest job security, least number of hours slept per week, and least affordable housing, it seems the good outweighs the bad in these situations. Those low-stress states also boasted the lowest divorce rates, least number of people living in poverty, high credit scores, low numbers of adults in fair or bad health, and more. Minnesota , the least stressed state of them all, was ranked among the states with the healthiest people, highest credit scores, lowest divorce rates, and most psychologists per capita. The findings suggest there are some serious perks to living a stress-free life. Maybe it\u2019s time to consider packing up and heading west, where the food's great, too .

The quote gradually recovered from 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of it September \u2013 November rise but couldn\u2019t clear 50-day simple moving average (SMA) during its recent journey. 100-day SMA level of 0.9960 can act as immediate support for the pair ahead of dragging it to 0.9930 and 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of 0.9900. In a case where prices keep declining under 0.9900, 0.9860 and an upward sloping trend-line since September could confine further downside near 0.9845. Meanwhile, break of 1.0000 mark comprising 50-day SMA can escalate recent recovery towards 1.0020 and 1.0040. Though, 1.0070, 1.0100 and 1.0130 could challenge buyers past-1.0040.\nAn immediate ascending trend-line at 0.9940 can provide intermediate rest between 0.9960 and 0.9930. 1.0055/60 is likely additional upside barrier on H4.\n0.9970 seems the closest support with 0.9910 being an additional filter on the downside. 1.0015 could become an extra stop during the quote\u2019s rise past-1.0000.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

EU and US Markit March Services and Composite PMI coming next.\nThe EUR/USD pair broke below the 1.1200 figure in the US afternoon, as the greenback gathered momentum across the board in the last trading session of the day, even in spite of dismal local data. The pair trade mute during Asian and European hours around the 1.1200 level, with the common currency unable to attract investors whatever the market mood was at the time. In the data front, the EU released February PPI, which rose by 0.1% MoM as expected, and by 3.0% YoY, this last, missing the market's expectations. As for the US, the country released February Durable Goods Orders. The headline reading was slightly better-than-expected, still down by 1.6%. The less volatile ex-transportation measure was up by a measly 0.1% MoM, while on a year-on-year basis growth cooled to 3.3%, while the most-relevant nondefense ex-aircraft figure declined by 0.1% MoM. The poor figures had a negative effect on Wall Street, with US indexes reversing part of their Monday gains. The dollar, however, gained against all but safe-haven rivals.\nThis Wednesday, the market's attention will be center on the final versions of the Markit Service and Composite PMI for the EU and the US. No relevant revisions are forecasted for the Union's numbers, although with the strong downward surprise coming from the Manufacturing PMI released earlier this week, market's previsions seem too optimistic. The US will also release the official ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI, expected at 58.0 vs. the previous 59.7, and the ADP survey on jobs' creation in the private sector, expected at 170K following 183K in February.\nThe pair is barely above the multi-month low of 1.1175, maintaining its downward strength ahead of the Asian opening, as the pair is closing in the red for a sixth consecutive day. In the 4 hours chart, it keeps developing below a bearish 20 SMA, currently at around 1.1220, while technical indicators hold within negative levels, aiming to resume their declines.\nSupport levels: 1.1175 1.1130 1.1085\nResistance levels: 1.1245 1.1280 1.1310\nView Live Chart for the EUR/USD\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Sterling soared in the US afternoon after PM May offered a cross-party approach to Brexit.\nThe GBP/USD pair trimmed its intraday losses and settled above 1.3100 after bottoming for the day at 1.3012. The Sterling came under selling pressure early London following the release of the UK Markit Construction PMI, down in March to 49.7, better than the previous 49.5 but below the market's forecast of 49.8. Brexit headlines kept coming, with the Pound up mid-US afternoon, after PM May made a statement following a cabinet meeting at Downing Street. Mrs. May said that a further extension is needed, aiming to leave the EU by May 22nd. She added that she is 'taking action to break the logjam,' and wants Corbyn to agree with her withdrawal agreement and on changes to the future relationship, offering a cross-party approach. Seems unlikely Corbyn will change his mind and support May, but rather keep seeking for an election. Meanwhile, MPs are focused on preventing a hard-Brexit, and will likely meet this week for another round of indicative votes. There were also some headlines indicating a possible emergency plan to pass a bill meant to stop a no-deal Brexit through an extension of Art. 50. The UK will see the release of the Markit Services PMI for March, foreseen at 50.9 vs. the previous 51.3.\nNow trading at around 1.3120, the 4 hours chart shows that the pair surpassed its 20 SMA, now flat at around 1.3050, while the price is challenging an also directionless 200 EMA. Technical indicators re-entered positive ground, with the Momentum lacking directional strength but the RSI maintaining its upward slope, in line with further gains ahead, to be confirmed on a break above the weekly high of 1.3149.\nSupport levels: 1.3085 1.3040 1.2990\nResistance levels: 1.3150 1.3200 1.3245\nView Live Chart for the GBP/USD\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
