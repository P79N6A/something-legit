Argentina Moves Again to Bolster the World's Weakest Currency (Bloomberg) -- Argentina\u2019s central bank said it won\u2019t allow its key interest rate to drop below 62.5 percent in April, buttressing its campaign to protect the peso.\nThe commitment comes on top of the central bank\u2019s pledge to freeze the monetary supply until the end of the year to cool inflation, part of a record $56 billion credit agreement with the International Monetary Fund. The peso gained as much as 1.5 percent to 42.70 per dollar on Monday, tracking gains in other emerging markets.\nThe latest step comes after a renewed slump in the peso pushed it to a record low on March 27, threatening to fuel an inflation rate that stood at 51 percent in February. Price-growth has proved stubbornly high after the bank eased policy this year, allowing the key rate, known as Leliq, to fall below 60 percent throughout January and February. The rate now stands at 68.2 percent, the highest in the world.\n\"Perseverance in the strict control of the evolution of the monetary base will lead to a reduction in inflation in upcoming months,\" the bank said in a statement after a meeting of its monetary policy committee.\nAll the same, the central bank expects inflation to remain elevated in March and April, based on high-frequency data it monitors.\nToday\u2019s announcement is the latest twist in the past year for the bank, which has had three presidents and a complete policy overhaul on top of the IMF bailout. It pulled out emergency measures last year to handle Argentina\u2019s currency crisis and recession. The peso lost more than half its value against the dollar and the economy fell into recession as investor concern about the nation\u2019s deficits helped spark the peso\u2019s plunge.\nThe government and IMF have long forecast that the economy will start to rebound in the second quarter of this year, backed by Argentina\u2019s soy harvest and exports. Some analysts say a rebound can\u2019t take place with rates and inflation this high. Economic activity barely rose in January compared with December, and fell 5.7 percent from a year ago, according to data published last week.\nFighting inflation while implementing austerity measures is challenging President Mauricio Macri\u2019s bid for re-election this year. His approval ratings declined to 30 percent in March. Argentines will cast their vote on Oct. 27, with a potential runoff vote between the two top candidates set for Nov. 24.\nMeasures the bank took last month included:\nTargeting an additional 10 percent reduction in the monetary base Extending its target for zero growth in the monetary base until December Adjusting its currency band 1.75 percent a month, compared with 2 percent Reducing the amount of dollars the central bank can buy if the peso falls below the currency band floor to $50 million a day from $75 million Expanding the limit Leliq banks can hold (Adds background on central bank in 6th-8th paragraphs.)\nArgentina Moves Again to Bolster the World's Weakest Currency", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fza.investing.com%2Fnews%2Fforex-news%2Fargentina-moves-again-to-bolster-the-worlds-weakest-currency-1440519&title=Argentina+Moves+Again+to+Bolster+the+World%27s+Weakest+Currency&summary=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=179222828858436&u=https%3A%2F%2Fza.investing.com%2Fnews%2Fforex-news%2Fargentina-moves-again-to-bolster-the-worlds-weakest-currency-1440519&display=popup&ref=plugin", "https://invst.ly/afnqq"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "leliq", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg \u00a9 reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "international monetary fund", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "argentina", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T05:32:24.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2021e5df830d095f566c73654194f5695b560a79", "url": "https://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/nrl/jarryd-hayne-reaches-agreement-with-us-woman-who-accused-him-of-rape-so-he-can-give-evidence-in-australia/news-story/29c8d99f1262b9cf0c401c09db961e76", "site_full": "www.heraldsun.com.au", "site": "heraldsun.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Sports News and Results | Herald Sun", "title": "NRL 2019: Jarryd Hayne reaches agreement with US woman to give evidence from Australia over rape allegations", "title_full": "NRL 2019: Jarryd Hayne reaches agreement with US woman to give evidence from Australia over rape allegations | Herald Sun", "published": "2019-04-01T16:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f145c1699f32f5a33d75afbc64b97d60", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7341, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2021e5df830d095f566c73654194f5695b560a79", "url": "https://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/nrl/jarryd-hayne-reaches-agreement-with-us-woman-who-accused-him-of-rape-so-he-can-give-evidence-in-australia/news-story/29c8d99f1262b9cf0c401c09db961e76", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Staff writers, FOX SPORTS", "published": "2019-04-01T16:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "NRL 2019: Jarryd Hayne reaches agreement with US woman to give evidence from Australia over rape allegations", "text": "Former rugby league player Jarryd Hayne has reportedly reached an agreement with an American woman who has accused him of rape, which will allow him to give evidence in Australia for the US civil case.\nThe former NFL and NRL player was accused of sexual assault by a young woman known only as JV during his time with the San Francisco 49ers in 2015.\nPolice did not prosecute Hayne over the alleged rape however the victim is pursuing him in civil court, with the trial set to go ahead in 2020.

The auto safety agency since 2007 has been investigating some Hyundai and Kia vehicles for fire risks. The South Korean automakers have recalled more than 2.3 million vehicles since 2015 to address various engine fire risks.\nThe probe covers the 2011-2014 Kia Optima and Sorento; and 2010-2015 Kia Soul, along with the 2011-2014 Hyundai Sonata and Santa Fe.\nHyundai said in a statement it was cooperating and added it has been in \"frequent, open and transparent dialogue regarding non-collision engine fires.\" Read also Toyota to invest S$682 million in Uber for self-driving cars\nKia said it will continue to work with NHTSA and \"openly shares information and data with NHTSA on all matters pertaining to vehicle safety.\"\nNHTSA said the decision to initiate the probe was based on its analysis of information received from multiple manufacturers, consumer complaints and other sources. The agency said prior Kia and Hyundai vehicle recalls covered by the probe are primarily related to engine fires the new probe \"is not limited to engine components and may cover additional vehicle systems or components.\"\nJason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said it was \"long past time for the full power of the federal government to be brought to bear to answer why so many thousands of Kia and Hyundai vehicles have been involved in non-crash fires.\"\nHe added he hoped the probe will quickly lead to new recalls. \"The evidence is now clear - Hyundai and Kia should have acted to recall these vehicles far earlier,\" he said.\nLast month, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said a group of US states is investigating Hyundai and Kia for potential unfair and deceptive acts related to reports of hundreds of vehicle fires.\nIn November, Reuters reported federal prosecutors had launched a criminal investigation into Hyundai and Kia to determine if vehicle recalls linked to engine defects had been conducted properly.\nIn January, the automakers agreed to offer software upgrades for 3.7 million vehicles not being recalled.\nA South Korean whistleblower in 2016 reported concerns to NHTSA, which has been probing the timeliness of three US recalls and whether they covered enough vehicles.\nIn 2015, Hyundai recalled 470,000 US Sonata sedans, saying engine failure would result in a vehicle stall, increasing the risk of a crash. At the time, Kia did not recall its vehicles, which share the same \"Theta II\" engines.\nIn March 2017, Hyundai expanded its original US recall to 572,000 Sonata and Santa Fe Sport vehicles with those Theta II engines, citing the same issue involving manufacturing debris. On the same day, Kia also recalled 618,000 Optima, Sorento and Sportage vehicles, all of which use the same engine.

Bogaerts signed a six-year, $120 million extension with the team on Monday. And manager Alex Cora was thrilled.\nIn an interview captured by NESN , Cora expressed that he was happy with the Red Sox' decision to keep him. And also, he noted that Bogaerts really wanted to remain in Boston as well.\nGreat for us, great for him. I was telling someone earlier, he\u2019s a great player, he\u2019s a better person. Smart individual. What they said in the press room is real. He wanted to stay here.\nCora also expressed pleasure that the Red Sox were working to lock up their core long-term, especially since the squad won a World Series.\nIt\u2019s something that, as Scott mentioned, is hard to do. To keep the core. But so far, so good.\nThe team will still need to lock up a couple of other players to keep the core intact. Notably, Rick Porcello is a free agent after the season while J.D. Martinez could opt out of his contract after the season too. Reportedly, the Red Sox and Martinez haven't discussed any sort of restructured contract .\nDave Dombrowski has indicated that the Red Sox won't be discussing contract extensions during the regular season. So it's likely that the team will have to wait to lock up the rest of their core until after the season.\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

Is Chris Sale's historically low fastball velocity cause for concern? By Darren Hartwell April 03, 2019 8:30 AM\nBy the box score, Chris Sale returned to form Tuesday night.\nSure, the Boston Red Sox ace gave up a solo home run, but that was one of only three hits he allowed to the Oakland Athletics over six innings of one-run ball.\nIf you checked the radar gun, though, you would have noticed a shocking trend. Sale threw 25 four-seam fastballs Tuesday night, and only 10 topped 90 miles per hour. His fastest pitch was clocked at 92 mph, and his average fastball velocity was 89.1 mph, the lowest in a single game in his career , according to Baseball Savant. (Hat tip to MassLive.com's Christopher Smith .)\nThat isn't just a dip in velocity. It's a stark drop-off for a hard-throwing left-hander who historically operates in the mid-90s.\nRed Sox pitching coach Dana LeVangie isn't losing sleep over this development, though.\n\"Zero. Zero concern,\" LeVangie told reporters after Boston's 1-0 loss, via WEEI.com . \"Not at all. He dialed it up when he wanted to. It\u2019s there. But he knows how important he is to this team. He can pitch regardless of the velocity.\"\nSale indeed was effective Tuesday night, even if he was more Greg Maddux than Nolan Ryan: He recorded just one strikeout over six innings, pitching to contact and letting his defense do the work. MORE RED SOX: Highlight's from Boston's 1-0 loss in Oakland\nWhile that's certainly not the Chris Sale Red Sox fans are used to, LeVangie is preaching patience.\n\"You guys want him to pitch the whole year or do you want him to go out and throw 100 (mph) right now and not be there for his team? He\u2019s building,\" LeVangie added.\n\"He had a long year last year. He\u2019s building up to be the guy he wants to be. He started last year similar. We\u2019re getting to that point, but just not right now.\"\nIf the Red Sox's cautious approach with Sale means he's stronger in August and September -- which were trouble areas for him in 2018 -- all the better. But considering Boston committed $145 million over the next five years to the 30-year-old hurler, there's reason for concern over Sale's uncharacteristic (if effective) outing.\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

A's Ramon Laureano again nails Red Sox' Xander Bogaerts with a spectacular throw A's Ramon Laureano again nails Red Sox' Xander Bogaerts with a spectacular throw By NBC Sports Boston Staff April 03, 2019 1:53 AM\nNext time Oaklandd Athletics center fielder Ramon Laureano has the ball, Xander Bogaerts is staying put.\n\"How can you do that two nights in a row?\" Bogaerts said after the game. \"The next time I won\u2019t run.\"\nThe Oakland center fielder - who threw out Bogaerts ( on an umpire's questionable call ) at the plate a night earlier - came up with another clutch throw to cut down the Red Sox shortstop at third base in the ninth inning and help preserve the A's 1-0 victory over the struggling Sox on Tuesday night. RAM\u00d3N LAUREANO IS NOT OF THIS UNIVERSE \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31 #RootedInOakland pic.twitter.com/M4DijfHIVl \u2014 Ram\u00f3n Laureano\u2019s Arm \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffd (@Athletics) April 3, 2019\nWith one out in the ninth, Bogaerts sent a deep drive to right-center off closer Blake Treinen that missed being a tying home run by about a foot. He didn't get down the first-base line at full speed, perhaps thinking he had a homer, and he hesitated momentarily as he rounded second. The result was another outfield assist for Laureano and the Sox' best chance to tie the score disappearing.\nAfter the game, Bogaerts told reporters, including the Providence Journal's Bill Koch , that Sox' season-opening struggles were behind his decision to try and stretch his hit to a triple.\n\"We haven\u2019t been playing our best these last two games. Obviously, our hitting hasn\u2019t been the way it normally is. Trying to get to third \u2013 the chances against [Treinen] with a runner at third are obviously bigger than with a runner at second.\"\nRed Sox manager Alex Cora called Laureano's throw \"a five-star play\" and said Bogaerts' ball not going out is just an example of what happens when a team is struggling.\nAfter Bogaerts was thrown out and a walk to Mitch Moreland, Brock Holt struck out against Treinen to end it. Despite their first quality start of the season (Chris Sale went six innings and allowed only Matt Chapman's first-inning home run and two other hits), the Red Sox fell to 1-5 - their worst start since the Bobby Valentine Era of 2012 - and are in the midst of their first four-game losing streak since 2017.\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

The pair fell from mid-1.34 handle to mid-1.33 handle, post the decline the pair saw rangebound price action as Loonie received support from both macro data update and positive crude oil price in the global market. When trading session opened for the week, the pair resumed its trading activity well near Friday\u2019s lows and traded range bound in the early Asian session.\nCanadian GDP Update & Crude Oil Price Underpin Loonie Bulls Optimism surrounding Sino-U.S. trade deal and headlines from China over the weekend which stated that the state council has decided to not impose tariffs on US goods in April as a sign of goodwill to the USA boosted risk appetite in the global market. Crude oil which has already been trading positive in the global market gained further momentum over Sino-U.S. trade optimism as a positive outcome could renew demand for increased crude oil in China. The prospect of increasing demand provided crude oil bulls with high positive influence helping spot US crude oil stay well above $60 per barrel across Asian and European market hours. Positive price action in crude oil helped commodity-linked currency Loonie gain strong fundamental support.\nThis helped Loonie retain its hold on price action resulting in pair declining slowly below the mid-1.33 handle. Further, increased risk appetite in the market which caused all major high-risk forex pairs to trade positive caused the US dollar to weaken in the broad market. Investors now await macro data updates for directional cues and short term profit opportunities. Canadian calendar will see the release of RBC Manufacturing PMI while US calendar will see the release of retail sales data, ISM Manufacturing PMI and Business inventories data updates. A positive outcome in US macro data will help US Greenback recover above mid-1.33 handle while negative outcome will help Loonie move below 1.3300 handle. As Canadian macro data lacks the strength to create a major impact on price action, broad-based strength of US dollar and crude oil price in the global market will set course for price action during today\u2019s American market hours.\nPlease feel free to let us know what you think in the comments below\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\nMore From FXEMPIRE: Gold Price Forecast \u2013 Gold markets looking for buyers Crude Oil Price Forecast \u2013 Crude oil markets continue to march higher AUD/USD Price Forecast \u2013 Australian dollar gapped higher to kick the week off Gold Price Prediction \u2013 Prices Move Sideways on Mixed Data USD/CAD Daily Price Forecast \u2013 Canadian Loonie Holds Fort On Weak Crude Oil GBP/JPY Price Forecast \u2013 British pound rallies to kick off the week", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "gdp update & crude oil price underpin loonie bulls", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T06:10:24.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ce9de162ac823589afc00bb263cb23401ce785b2", "url": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-02/wall-street-boost-on-unexpected-strong-us-china-manufacturing/10961580", "site_full": "www.abc.net.au", "site": "abc.net.au", "site_section": "http://www.abc.net.au//news/feed/51120/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["television", "music", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Just In", "title": "Wall St boosted by unexpectedly strong US and Chinese manufacturing", "title_full": "Wall St boosted by unexpectedly strong US and Chinese manufacturing", "published": "2019-04-01T23:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/4337798-16x9-700x394.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1455, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ce9de162ac823589afc00bb263cb23401ce785b2", "url": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-02/wall-street-boost-on-unexpected-strong-us-china-manufacturing/10961580", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "David Chau", "published": "2019-04-01T23:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Wall St boosted by unexpectedly strong US and Chinese manufacturing", "text": "Map: Australia\nAustralian shares are set to follow Wall Street higher, after it was boosted by unexpectedly strong US and Chinese factory activity.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia will hold its monthly meeting today, and no interest rate hikes (or cuts) are expected.

The currency pair clocked a high and low of 1.3114 and 1.3026, respectively, earlier today.\nDespite the negative action, the outlook remains neutral as 200-day moving average (MA) support, currently at 1.3008 is intact.\nThat long-term average line has repeatedly restricted downside in the last ten days or so. In fact, the pair created a doji candle at that crucial support on Friday, signaling indecision in the market place and posted a positive follow-through with a move to 1.3150 yesterday.\nThe pair, therefore, risks rising to 1.32 this week and a convincing break below the 200-day MA line of 1.3008 is needed to revive the bearish view put forward by the lower high of 1.3269 created on March 27.

USD/JPY: Bulls continue to struggle, attention stays on 111.20 support\nThe USD/JPY pair is seen trading cautiously in a 20-pips so far this Tuesday, as risk sentiment sours amid negative S&P 500 futures and Treasury yields while the downside remains capped on the back of a broadly firmer US dollar.

We prepared the team with the usual course we are familiar with,\u201d the highly respected coach said.\nHe added: \u201cIt was clear our team lacked the stamina to conquer the eight hills on the Aarhus course.

Although we did lots of hill work in training it appears it wasn\u2019t enough. In future, AK will be sending scouts to the venue to see the course first hand,\u201d said Njoga who is also AK Prisons Service chairman and Deputy Director General of Kenya Prisons Service.\nIt was the first time since 1984 that Kenya finished out of medal bracket in the U20 men\u2019s race at the World Cross despite entered high-quality field Samuel Chebole, Emmanuel Kiprotich, Leonard Bett, Edwin Koskei, Charles Karuri, Kibet Kandie that struggle from the outset on the 8km course.

She said Mr Biden, then 66, moved towards her while she was in the kitchen with several other volunteers at the private residence where the fund raiser was being held.\nRelated Story Ex-lawmaker says likely Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden inappropriately touched her in 2014 Related Story Potential Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden responds to kissing incident, says never acted improperly \"It wasn't sexual, but he did grab me by the head,\" she told the newspaper. \"He put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me. When he was pulling me in, I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth.\"\nMs Lappos, 43, did not immediately respond to an e-mail and a phone call seeking comment.\nMs Lappos worked as an aide to Mr Himes from January 2009 to November 2016, primarily as a constituent services representative and grants coordinator, according to Legistorm, a congressional research firm. Her LinkedIn page lists her as the owner of Moma Grants, a freelance grant-writing service.\nA Biden spokesman referred The Washington Post to a statement the former vice-president issued on Sunday, in which Mr Biden said he had offered \"countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort\" during his years in public life, \"and not once - never - did I believe I acted inappropriately\" .\nMr Himes was not immediately available for comment.\nThe news comes days after Ms Flores said in her piece for New York magazine's The Cut that Mr Biden approached her from behind during a 2014 campaign rally, placed his hands on her shoulders, moved closer to her and planted a \"big slow kiss\" on the back of her head.\nShe said on Sunday that his behaviour had made her feel \"powerless\" and \"like I couldn't move.\"\nIt also comes as Mr Biden is under increasing pressure from women's rights groups, prominent black leaders and other supporters of Anita Hill to acknowledge his responsibility for his handling of the 1991 confirmation hearing of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\nMr Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee when the hearing took place; he recently sparked a backlash when he said he regretted that he \"couldn't come up with a way to get (Hill) the kind of hearing she deserved\".\nIn her interview with the Courant, Ms Lappos said she did not report the alleged 2009 incident at the time because \"he was the Vice-President. I was a nobody\". She said she believed Mr Biden's behaviour had crossed a line of \"decency\" and \"respect\".\n\"Crossing that line is not grandfatherly. It's not cultural. It's not affection. It's sexism or misogyny,\" she said.\nThe US$1,000-per-ticket fund raiser took place Oct 5, 2009, at the Greenwich home of Mr Ron Moelis, an affordable-housing developer. The event was covered for the Stamford Advocate by Mr Neil Vigdor, the reporter who broke the story about Ms Lappos' allegations on Monday for the Courant.\nAccording to Mr Vigdor's 2009 piece, Mr Biden spoke for about 19 minutes on the Moelis home's rear terrace to an audience of 150 Connecticut Democrats, including Mr Richard Blumenthal and Mr Dannel Malloy. Mr Blumenthal, now the state's senior senator, was then the state's attorney general; Mr Malloy, who served as governor from 2011 to 2019, was Stamford's mayor at the time.\nMr Biden touted Mr Himes' record at the event, according to Mr Vigdor's story.\n\"I've campaigned for a lot of congressmen over my career,\" the then-Vice-President said of Mr Himes. \"My lord, Rhodes Scholar, Wall Street. I think we got you straight out of Central Casting.\"\nMr Himes reportedly said: \"There is nobody in Washington, DC, with the heart that Joe Biden has.\"\nMs Lappos has voted as a registered Democrat in the past, voter records show.\nHer personal Facebook page prominently displays a black-and-white photo of five female Democratic presidential candidates: Senators Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. The photo was posted on Feb 21.\nA day before her allegations were reported by the Courant, Ms Lappos commented on Mr Biden on Facebook, republishing text that criticised his performance during past presidential bids, along with the performance of other male presidential candidates in past elections.\n\"This - elect women already.

At the same time, his team has pushed back against what it views as unfair criticism.\nOn Monday, Biden spokesman Bill Russo released a \"Note on Recent Coverage\" that highlighted the backstory behind two photos that have been widely circulated as evidence of Mr Biden's highly physical style.\nIn a 2015 photo with Mrs Stephanie Carter, wife of then-incoming Defence Secretary Ash Carter, Mr Biden is holding her shoulders and leaning in to whisper something in her ear.\nMrs Carter wrote in a Medium post on Sunday night that Mr Biden \"kept his hands on my shoulders as a means of offering his support\" on the day of her husband's swearing-in.\nIn 2015 photos with Ms Maggie Coons, the then-13-year-old daughter of Senator Christopher Coons, Mr Biden is leaning towards her and whispering something before kissing the side of her head.\nWhile the girl appeared to react with discomfort, Mr Coons told The Post that there was nothing inappropriate in the encounter - \"she did not think of it as anything\".\nMr Russo called these perspectives \"corrections of false (narratives)\" about the two episodes.\n\"The familiar characterisations of these two photos that have been uncritically perpetuated, turn out to be very false,\" he wrote.\nMr Coons said on Monday that he believes the renewed public attention on Mr Biden's actions will not stop him from pursuing a 2020 White House bid.\n\"I'm confident he's going to run,\" the senator told Politico.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jim himes", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "joe biden", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lappos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucy flores", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alice paul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mr biden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "biden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy lappos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "himes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flores", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hartford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenwich", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T06:22:40.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2ed00c41f9e5dbfd077217a2487df31593298bed", "url": "https://hypestat.com/info/7y8q.us", "site_full": "hypestat.com", "site": "hypestat.com", "site_section": "https://hypestat.com/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "HypeStat.com", "title": "7y8q.us - 7y8q", "title_full": "7y8q.us - 7y8q", "published": "2019-04-01T18:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7923, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2ed00c41f9e5dbfd077217a2487df31593298bed", "url": "https://hypestat.com/info/7y8q.us", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-01T18:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "7y8q.us - 7y8q", "text": "What sites are related to 7y8q.us?

Bucklew suffers from a medical condition known as congenital cavernous hemangioma that causes tumors of malformed blood vessels to grow on his head, face, and neck.\nHis lawyers claimed that lethal injection could cause him to suffocate on his own blood and would violate the US Constitution\u2019s Eighth Amendment prohibition of \u201ccruel and unusual punishment.\u201d\nPhoto: CNS/Tyler Orsburn\nThe five conservative justices on the court ruled that it would not. \u201cThe Eighth Amendment does not guarantee a prisoner a painless death \u2014 something that, of course, isn\u2019t guaranteed to many people, including most victims of capital crimes,\u201d said Justice Neil Gorsuch, writing for the majority.\nBucklew had proposed the use of nitrogen gas to carry out the execution instead of the single drug pentobarbital, but Gorsuch said he had failed to prove this would ease his suffering.\n\u201cEven if execution by nitrogen hypoxia were a feasible and readily implemented alternative to the state\u2019s chosen method, Mr. Bucklew has still failed to present any evidence suggesting that it would significantly reduce his risk of pain,\u201d he wrote.

Back Trading the News: Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Interest Rate Decision\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) interest rate decision may drag on the AUD/USD exchange rate as the central bank is widely anticipated to keep the official cash rate (OCR) at the record-low of 1.50% in April.\nIt seems as though the RBA will continue to endorse a wait-and-see approach monetary policy as the central bank sees \u2018 scenarios where an increase in the cash rate would be appropriate at some point and other scenarios where a decrease in the cash rate would be appropriate. \u2019 Mixed language coming out of the RBA is likely to weigh on the Australian dollar as the central bank looks to further support the economy, and Governor Philip Lowe & Co. may continue to tame bets for higher interest rates as officials note \u2018 that there was not a strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy. \u2019\nHowever, an unexpected batch of hawkish rhetoric may trigger a bullish reaction in AUD/USD as it spurs bets for an RBA rate-hike, and a upcoming change in regime may heighten the appeal of the Australian dollar as market participants prepare for higher interest rates.

Advertising\nU.S. officials told their Turkish counterparts they will not receive further shipments of F-35 related equipment needed to prepare for the arrival of the stealthy jet, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday. The Pentagon confirmed the Reuters report that the equipment delivery had been stopped.\n\u201cPending an unequivocal Turkish decision to forgo delivery of the S-400 , deliveries and activities associated with the stand-up of Turkey\u2019s F-35 operational capability have been suspended,\u201d Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Mike Andrews, a Defense Department spokesman, said in a statement.\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan has refused to back down from Ankara\u2019s planned purchase of a Russian S-400 missile defense system that the United States has said would compromise the security of F-35 aircraft.

The aircraft is built by Lockheed Martin Corp. Latest Videos Some Venezuelans Have Turned on Maduro, and Paid With Their Lives\nA Pentagon official had told Reuters in March that the United States had a number of items it could withhold in order to send Turkey a signal that the United States was serious about Ankara dropping its ambition to own the S-400. Turkish officials in Ankara were not immediately available for comment. Turkey has said it will take delivery of the S-400s in July.\nNATO SUMMIT\nThe U.S. decision on the F-35s was expected to complicate Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu\u2019s planned visit to Washington this week for a NATO summit.

Turkey makes parts of the fuselage, landing gear and cockpit displays. Sources familiar with the F-35\u2019s intricate worldwide production process and U.S. thinking on the issue last week said Turkey\u2019s role can be replaced.\nThe United States and other NATO allies that own F-35s fear the radar on the Russian S-400 missile system will learn how to spot and track the jet, making it less able to evade Russian weapons in the future.\nIn an attempt to persuade Turkey to drop its plans to buy the S-400, the United States offered the pricier American-made Patriot anti-missile system in a discounted deal that expired at the end of March. Turkey has shown interest in the Patriot system, but not at the expense of abandoning the S-400.

hiring other conspirators (runners) to retrieve money wired by the victims to those runners; and/or hiring runners to open bank accounts into which victims deposited fraud proceeds, revealed the documents.\nThe defendants collected the proceeds by providing the runners with the victims' names, locations, and amounts paid.\nThe runners were directed to retrieve the fraud proceeds in cash and turn the funds over to the defendants, often less a payment to the runner for opening the account or conducting the transaction, according to the documents.\nFour others have already pleaded guilty for their roles in the scheme.\nOn March 25, Alejandro Juarez was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison. Hemalkumar Shah, Sharvil Patel and Brenda Dozier are currently awaiting sentencing.\n\"We here at IRS CI recognise the heartache and concern these crooks cause innocent people. This is why we are eager to team up with our law enforcement partners to track down these impersonators in whatever corner of the globe they may be hiding in,\" said special agent in-charge Mary Hammond of IRS Criminal Investigations, Tampa Field Office.\nJ Russell George, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, said, \"Over the last several years, American taxpayers have been subjected to unprecedented attempts to fraudulently obtain money by individuals impersonating Internal Revenue Service employees.\"\n\"Victimising taxpayers by impersonating IRS employees is a serious crime,\" he said.

The new regulations of Electronic Money Institutions have been prepared with technical assistance of the World Bank.\nThis is for the first time that non-banking entities have been permitted to provide money services without contacting with the banks, said State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Deputy Governor Jameel Ahmad. Ahmad said that enhancing cyber resilience was the first priority of the regulator.\nThe deputy governor said that by 2020 the central bank will also issue digital currency aimed at reducing corruption and inefficiency.\nIt is estimated that the informal economy is almost equal to the size of Pakistan\u2019s formal economy, currently estimated below $280 billion. The government also faces the issue of money laundering and terrorism financing and these regulations are expected to address this challenge as well.\nThe e-money regulations also cover other regulatory requirements including outsourcing activities, AML/CFT, consumer protection, complaint handling mechanism, oversight and regulatory reporting, said SBP Payment Systems Department Director Sohail Javaad.\nJavaad said that there will be mandatory screening of the clients by the e-money institutions to comply with the United Nations Security Council\u2019s anti-terrorism related resolutions. The service providers will have to ensure minimum Rs200 million capital for up to Rs4 billion worth of transactions. They will be allowed to invest 50% of their last three months outstanding amounts in the government securities.\nThe clients will be allowed to withdraw only up to Rs10,000 per day aimed at promoting digitisation.\nThe digitisation of the economy will help break the elite capture of the economy, said Umar. He said that so far people having connections in the Q Block \u2013 the seat of the finance ministry, and the SBP were making money by blocking innovations. A recent report of the World Bank says that four classes \u2013 the industrialists, civil servants, landlords and the military have captured Pakistan\u2019s economy.\nThe e-money will ensure fundamental transformation of the economy and digital guys would soon start eating lunch of conventional bankers, said the finance minister.\nHe cautioned that the central bank should be careful about cybercrimes and ensure full protection of the electronic systems.\nThe finance minister also urged the central bank to review its policy of confidentiality of the clients of the banks. A thief should not have the privilege of confidentiality, he added.\nUmar also said that the e-money institutions will complement the efforts of the government in creating an enabling environment to empower stakeholders in trade and commerce. This will help businesses improve their productivity and contribute towards positioning the nation for global competition, he added.\nThe finance minister said that the government was determined to transform the country into a knowledge economy by making information technology one of the top contributors in Pakistan\u2019s economy and job creation besides producing world-class knowledge workers in sync with international market trends.\nThe finance minister termed the launching of electronic money institutions as a game changer for promoting e-commerce and digital economy in the country.\nIn his address, Ahmad shared the SBP\u2019s initiatives in transforming itself into a modern, digital and fully technology oriented central bank. These landmark regulations are a testament of SBP\u2019s commitment towards openness, adoption of technology and digitisation of our financial system, he added.\nAhmad said that SBP had issued the regulations for branchless banking about a decade ago that enabled the entry of telecommunication companies into the arena of banking and payments.\nThe prime objective of branchless banking was to enable the delivery of financial services using telco-based agent network. Over the past few years, branchless banking providers have evolved well and are now offering financial services to a large segment of our population.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, April 2 nd , 2019.\nLike Business on Facebook , follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.

But Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said he's not sure \"why the Fed needs to go into panic mode\" when data are still pointing to a healthy economy. Published 11:43 PM ET Mon, 1 April 2019 Updated 12:52 AM ET Tue, 2 April 2019 CNBC.com\nEconomic data in the U.S. don't justify an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve \u2014 despite recent calls for the American central bank to do so, said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics.\nTop White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said last week that the U.S. central bank should \"immediately\" cut interest rates by 50 basis points. His comment followed a similar stance by Heritage Foundation fellow Stephen Moore , whom U.S. President Donald Trump has said he intends to nominate for a position on the Fed.\nTheir comments came after the Fed's latest decision to hold rates steady as it cut the central bank's forecasts for U.S. economic expansion and inflation. The central bank also warned of slowing growth in Europe and China .\nWhile the U.S. is indeed growing at a slower pace, economic data don't suggest the need to cut interest rates, Zandi told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday.\n\"I'm not sure why the Fed needs to go into panic mode here,\" he said. He pointed to the latest data that showed the U.S. economy was still healthy: Unemployment rate was close to a 50-year low, wage growth was strong, inflation inched closer to the Fed's target of 2 percent and the stock market looked like it could hit record levels again.\nLowering interest rates under such conditions would be \"counter-productive\" because the move could \"juice things up\" and encourage debt to build up in the economy, he explained.\nRising debt in the U.S. is a risk that Zandi flagged last year. He said \"over-borrowing\" among companies would become problematic and could send the economy into a recession.

By Updated: Apr 02, 2019, 03.59 PM IST 0 Comments ThinkStock Photos\nIndia was also assured that the US will not share data from Indian platforms with another country, nor access this data without prior permission. NEW DELHI: India and the US have set up the first ever secure communication link between the naval headquarters here and the US Central as well as Pacific Naval Commands under the landmark Indo-US COMCASA pact reached last year. ET has reliably gathered that the US has also activated the Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module GPS system in some of C-130 and C-17 transport aircraft as a result of the implementation of the COMCASA (Communications, Compatibility & Security Agreement). In a major boost to India\u2019s defence diplomacy, the two upgrades will allow both sides to share real-time operational intelligence. In the case of the C-130s and C-17s, the systems were purchased but not activated because the US said it could not part with the encryption codes until the enabling COMCASA pact is signed. The establishment of a secure active link between the two navies is being seen as a significant step forward as India will gain access to latest US naval intelligence besides conducting joint operations in the future. The link was set up, sources said, by a US team which visited India recently. The Comcasa pact will in due course enable both sides to operate on the same communication systems, thus helping build an \u201cinteroperable\u201d environment for militaries. Without this pact, the US could not part with highly coded communication gear with the military platforms they sell to India. As a result, India had to depend on less secure systems on, otherwise, high-end platforms like C-130Js and the P8I maritime surveillance aircraft, among others. While negotiating the pact, India also obtained a reliability assurance from the US that it will ensure availability of secured communication equipment covered by the pact at all time as well as keep them operational. India was also assured that the US will not share data from Indian platforms with another country, nor access this data without prior permission.

They said the process helped them come in direct contact with their \u201ceyes and ears\u201d \u2014 the men and women who have access to several homes in a neighbourhood \u2014 to solve crimes.\nThe arrest of a maid, Chayna Mukherjee (48), from Baishnabghata Road on Sunday for stealing 10.5 bhori gold and silver, worth Rs 4 lakh, was a success of this model, stated Netaji Nagar police . \u201cChayna had been working here for the past 10 years. We trusted her and even took her on holidays with us. But over the past one year, she started taking huge loans and we became suspicious of her activities. We told her to return the ornaments but she denied having committed the crime. When police spoke to our security guards, other maids and local gold shops, they realized what she was up to,\u201d said Mukherjee\u2019s employer and complainant Sudeshna Dey (43).\nTimesViewThis can help in quicker crime detection and improve policing. But this must be implemented systematically across police stations to yield results. Care should also be taken to ensure that citizens are not inconvenienced.\n\u201cDuring the probe, we did not limit ourselves to the statement of the complainant. Inputs from other maids were equally helpful. The model that we followed was a simple one \u2014 instead of merely waiting for an individual to get his/her maid, driver or guard verified with us, we set up camps on holidays at select locations and asked employees to fill up the requisite forms,\u201d said a top officer of the division.\n\u201cThis has two advantages. One, we can seek the help from the service providers, whose details we secured in the camps, for leads on suspects even if the suspect is not registered with us. Two, they act as our eyes and ears and their leads can help us prevent crimes,\u201d he said", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "baishna", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "chayna mukherjee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netaji nagar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sudeshna dey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chayna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mukherjee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kolkata news", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "kolkata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baishnabghata road", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T07:00:48.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c4354a223a4a941959183046b09a4690af20e0d5", "url": "https://ca.news.yahoo.com/measles-count-us-already-more-141000992.html", "site_full": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://ca.news.yahoo.com/?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Yahoo News Canada - Latest News & Headlines", "title": "Measles count in US this year already more than all of 2018", "title_full": "Measles count in US this year already more than all of 2018", "published": "2019-04-01T23:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3rwgkTgSfcmuro8SSX7xkA--~B/aD01MzM7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-ca/homerun/cp.org/6c1eebdba6c41c83be3b7cbf0e4156cf", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c4354a223a4a941959183046b09a4690af20e0d5", "url": "https://ca.news.yahoo.com/measles-count-us-already-more-141000992.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The Canadian Press", "published": "2019-04-01T23:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "Measles count in US this year already more than all of 2018", "text": "NEW YORK \u2014 The number of U.S. measles cases through the first three months of this year have surpassed the count for all of 2018, health officials say. There have been 387 cases through March, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Monday. There were 372 last year.\nThe numbers are preliminary, and may change. But the 2019 tally is already the most since 2014, when 667 were reported.\nThis year's numbers have been driven by outbreaks in several states, including New York, California, Illinois, Texas, and Washington.\nMost people who get measles have not been vaccinated. In the U.S., most outbreaks are sparked by travellers who picked up the virus in countries where measles is more common. Nearly 83,000 people contracted measles in Europe in 2018, the highest number in a decade, according to the World Health Organization.\nThe measles vaccine is 97% effective, according to the CDC.\nMeasles is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and it is extremely contagious.\nFor most people, measles is miserable but not life-threatening. The most common symptoms include fever, runny nose, cough, and a rash all over the body. However, a very small fraction of people get much sicker, and can suffer complications like pneumonia and swelling of the brain. Also, measles can cause pregnant women to deliver prematurely.\nThere have been three measles-related deaths reported in the U.S. since 2000, including two in 2003 and one in 2015.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Key FX News Monday\nThe anti-risk Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc were the worst-performing majors on Monday, sinking with a pickup market mood. Optimism began in early Monday trade where upbeat Chinese PMI data crossed the wires . S&P 500 futures rose and preceded a 1.16% rally in the index when trading began on Wall Street. That was the S&P\u2019s best performance in 3 weeks.\nSentiment picked up later in the day when better-than-expected US ISM Manufacturing PMI data crossed the wires, clocking in at 55.3 versus 54.5 expected. Softer-than-expected domestic retail sales for February were brushed aside when that was released an hour and a half earlier. Local bond yields climbed, showing a softening in dovish Fed monetary policy expectations which benefited the US Dollar .\nAs the markets transitioned into Tuesday, the British Pound tumbled after the UK Parliament yet again failed to reach a consensus for an alternative to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal . This increased the threat of a \u2018no deal\u2019 divorce with the withdrawal deadline on April 12 th fast approaching. Meanwhile, anti-fiat gold prices declined amidst a stronger Greenback, as anticipated . Tuesday\u2019s Asia Pacific Trading Session\nTop tier event risk for Tuesday\u2019s Asia Pacific session is the Reserve Bank of Australia rate decision. Overnight index swaps are pricing in about a 75% chance that the central bank could cut benchmark lending rates by the end of this year. This has followed increasingly cautious outlooks from the Fed , ECB and more recently the RBNZ . The latter now favors a cut as its next move, risking further declines in NZD .\nWith expectations of dovishness so high, the risks then for AUD/USD are arguably tilted to the upside in the event the RBA remains neutral. For some time, the central bank has continued reiterating the notion that it sees no strong case for a near-term adjustment in rates. As such, staying put would probably send the Australian Dollar rallying. Having said that, shifting away from that notion would be significant. AUD/NZD Technical Analysis\nOne of the pairs that I am closely watching is AUD/NZD . It just recently pushed above a trend-defining descending resistance line from August. Confirming another daily close above it on the chart below could carry significant bullish implications, especially if the RBA maintains its neutral outlook.

It is especially important today when the entire world can see the cynical campaign that aims to topple the legitimate Venezuelan government, including by threatening it with direct military intervention.\"\n\" Russia has consistently spoken in support of the exclusively peaceful resolution of internal Venezuelan problems. It is obvious that Venezuelans must independently take steps to fix the current situation without instructions, pressure or ultimatums from the outside,\" the statement read.\n\"We have expressed our solidarity with the friendly Venezuelan people and our support for the measures taken by Nicolas Maduro's government to prevent further destabilisation. We have reaffirmed our readiness to join in the efforts of regional and international mediators calling for an inclusive national dialogue. As I have said, we will be ready to join in given the consent of the main political forces in Venezuela,\" the Foreign Minister added to the statement.\nThe US and Russia have been blaming each other for the worsening political and economic situation in Venezuela. While Washington openly supported self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaido, Moscow and Beijing are more inclined toward President Nicolas Maduro.

Picture: Ulet Ifansasti/Getty Images Source:Getty Images A US citizen is facing a possible death penalty if convicted over a trafficable quantity of drugs allegedly found in a house in Indonesia over the weekend.\nThe 46-year-old man identified only by his initials CS and a 24-year-old Indonesian man identified as MR were arrested and charged after police raided a house in Gili Trawangan , a party island 100km west of Bali known as a hub for ecstasy and where hallucinogenic \u201cmagic mushroom\u201d shakes are sold openly at restaurants and bars.\nPolice claim to have discovered 1224 grams of marijuana in various bags and boxes in the house. They also said they found an unspecified quantity of methamphetamine separated into 13 small ziplock bags, an unspecified quantity of magic mushrooms, as well as smoking implements and cash, allegedly obtained from selling drugs to tourists on the island.\nThe raid coincided with a stern warning issued by a senior police official to foreigners selling drugs in Indonesia at an event where drug suspects were paraded and shamed at a park in Bali\u2019s capital Denpasar on Sunday. Suspects in drug crimes are often paraded in front of the media in Denpasar.

I will take decisive action.\u201d\nIt was the second public shaming of drug suspects in Bali this year. On February 24, a group of 23 suspects wearing orange prison garbs and handcuffs with their feet shackled in chains were presented to journalists by heavily armed riot police at the same park in Denpasar.\nThe event took place in front of a statue of a bear-chested Indonesian warrior commissioned by Balinese police as a symbol for their war against drugs. An Indonesian policeman guards Nusakambangan prison in Cilacap, known as \u201cexecution island\u201d. Picture: Bayu Nur/AFP Source:AFP\nThe public spectacles have been criticised by drug counsellors as unnecessary, counter-productive and illegal given none of the suspects had yet been convicted of any crimes.\n\u201cHow could they do that? That\u2019s not the way to deter them,\u201d chairman of the Balinese chapter of the Association of Indonesian Addiction Counsellors Erijadi Sulaeman told the Jakarta Post .\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget they have rights. The police should remember that before someone is convicted, they should uphold the presumption of innocence.\u201d\nPolice Chief Ruddi Setiawan remained undeterred. \u201cWe want to give them some social punishment, apart from the criminal punishment,\u201d he said at the time.\nThe death penalty is routinely handed to drug criminals in Indonesia, where more than 200 prisoners are currently awaiting execution.\nIf successfully convicted, CS will become the second American on death row in Indonesia.

In the film, Elisabeth Moss' character Kitty has twin daughters, Becca and Lindsey Tyler, who had seriously creepy roles as the evil twin versions of them attack the families.\n\u00a9 Provided by Hola S.L. \u2013 Hello Magazines us-friends\nHowever, eagle-eyed fans of the film were quick to make the realisation that Becca and Lindsey are played by Noelle and Cali Sheldon, who shared the role of baby Emma in the popular sitcom, Friends. Fans were shocked by the revelation, with one writing: \"Finding out the twin girls in @JordanPeele #UsMovie are the girls who played Rachel and Ross's baby Emma in friends is the biggest twist of the film!\" Another person added: \"I just found out that the twins in #UsMovie played baby Emma in Friends and I'm shook .\"\nThe twins regularly post snaps on Instagram, and recently shared a photo of themselves next to their onscreen mum Jennifer Aniston's star of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Quote: : \"We found the coolest star! #jenniferaniston.\" Noelle also shared a snap of herself with her twin on the famous Friends sofa in Central Perk, writing: \"The one where Emma got cloned.\" Previously speaking about their time on Friends, Noelle told Bustle : \"A lot of people in our school watch it, and most of them know we were in it, so they think that's pretty cool.\" Their mum Gretchen Carpenter added: \"Everyone was really, really nice to Noelle and Cali, and treated them like little princesses on the set.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.hellomagazine.com/film/2019032671326/jordan-peele-us-ending-explained-details-you-missed/", "http://www.hellomagazine.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "emma", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "hola s.l.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noelle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cali sheldon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lindsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan peele", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kitty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lindsey tyler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rachel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ross", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elisabeth moss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "becca", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T07:24:27.030+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f7f4989bd99d261df4216982c3d7282d9f7b1831", "url": "https://www.khaleejtimes.com/news/general/video-us-rockstar-meets-dubais-viral-perfume-maker-from-india-", "site_full": "www.khaleejtimes.com", "site": "khaleejtimes.com", "site_section": "http://www.khaleejtimes.com/services/rss/international/rss.xml\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "KT Mobile", "title": "Video: US rockstar meets Dubai's viral perfume maker from India", "title_full": "Video: US rockstar meets Dubai's viral perfume maker from India", "published": "2019-04-02T01:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "NO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.khaleejtimes.com/storyimage/KT/20190402/ARTICLE/190409940/AR/0/AR-190409940.jpg&NCS_modified=&exif=.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7403, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 11}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f7f4989bd99d261df4216982c3d7282d9f7b1831", "url": "https://www.khaleejtimes.com/news/general/video-us-rockstar-meets-dubais-viral-perfume-maker-from-india-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T01:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Video: US rockstar meets Dubai's viral perfume maker from India", "text": "Video: US rockstar meets Dubai's viral perfume maker from India Yousuf Saifuddin Kapadia, Nilanjana Gupta /Dubai | Last updated on April 2, 2019 at 06.37 am Share Vote\n(Screengrab) Khaleej Times had just recently featured the Indian perfume maker in our 'Humans of UAE' series. What are the odds of a fan in UAE bumping into their favourite celebrity out and about in UAE? Very slim, as they mostly move around off-peak hours, or stay in hotels far from the main city, or usually explore old areas of the country to learn about the history and culture (Slash of Guns N' Roses visited Deira during the band's last Dubai tour in 2017). But one lucky Dubai expat didn't just bump into an international celebrity here. The celeb walked into his store, and purchased some perfumes he made especially for her. Incidentally, the expat had been featured in Khaleej Times' 'Humans of UAE' web video series, where the video was viewed nearly a million times. American pop-rock star, Gwen Stefani, who visited the city to perform at the Dubai World Cup, paid a visit to perfumer Yousuf Mohammed Ali Madappan before she flew out. An Indian expat has been concocting scents in Deira's Gold Souq for 30 years, and is quite the local star in his own right, which led us to him for a 'Humans of UAE' webisode in November of 2018. The 'Hollaback Girl' star had apparently uploaded a video of her visit to the perfumer's store on her Instagram account, where it went viral. Bt what caught our attention was the perfumer, Yousuf. What are the odds of that happening?! The timing of it all got us excited and Khaleej Times once again reached out to Yousuf to find out what exactly transpired that day. Recounting the high-profile visit, the humble perfumer said that he was unaware of Stefani's celeb status, otherwise he would have taken a selfie photo or video with her and given her a royal treatment. \"I got a random phone call from a guy, who said he wanted me to make a 'custom perfume' for a lady. I asked him to bring her over, and they visited my store on Sunday at 11am.\" \"She asked me to make 2-3 custom fragrances for her. There were four other people with her. They spent nearly 3 hours at my shop. Stefani was so happy with the fragrances that she asked me for a hug and a kiss - to which I only obliged for a hug and a traditional Arab cheek kiss. \"Then she recorded (the now viral) selfie video.\" When she asked him if she could take a selfie, Yousuf jokingly said, \"make sure I look handsome.\" Yousuf ended up concocting two scents for her, comprising of patchouli, vanilla and musk notes. - Khaleej Times (@khaleejtimes) April 1, 2019 The other one was an Arabian scent, as per her request. \"I didn't know that she was such so popular. I just found out today that she's a famous singer. Had I known earlier, I would have given her royal treatment.\" He didn't even know that she is a celebrity. Now, that's what you call a 'scent-sational' encounter.

(AP) -- The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration viewed one drug-producing company as the \"kingpin within a drug cartel,\" according to a Tennessee lawsuit over the opioid epidemic.\nA nearly 250-page amended complaint filed Monday in Circuit Court for Cumberland County said the DEA labeled Mallinckrodt a \"kingpin\" because it shipped opioids in high volumes to pharmacies it knew were feeding \"pill mills\" in Florida, which supplied Tennessee's illegal drug market.\nA spokesman for St. Louis-based Mallinckrodt called it a \"gross and inflammatory mischaracterization of the facts designed to create headlines.\"\nThe new claims come as drug companies field a flurry of lawsuits nationwide over the scourge of opioid abuse.\nThe Tennessee complaint was filed on behalf of five district attorneys general and a child born addicted to opioids.\nIt targets Mallinckrodt and other opioid producers; distributors; pharmacies; alleged \"pill mill\" prescribers; and Richard Sackler, whose family owns Purdue Pharma.\nAccording to the lawsuit, a national account manager for Mallinckrodt once said in a phone conversation with a Florida distributor that the company's opioids were \"just like Doritos; keep eating, we'll make more.\"\nThe Mallinckrodt spokesman called it \"an outrageously callous email from an individual who has not been employed by the company for many years.\"\n\"It is antithetical to everything that Mallinckrodt stands for and has done to combat opioid abuse and misuse,\" he continued.\nThe lawsuit also says that another drug maker, Endo, at one point chose to exclude Tennessee abuse numbers of one of its opioids from its nationwide calculations because they were so high.

The official manufacturing PMI rose to 50.5 in March from 49.2 in February, while the Caixin/Markit PMI rose to 50.8 from 49.9. Both readings rose above the 50-point line between expansion and contraction for the first time in four months, signalling a return to growth.\nAnalysts said China\u2019s infrastructure investment stimulus, which was mostly funded by the issuance of local government special bonds at the beginning of the year, has begun to kick in, and that stabilising Chinese domestic demand pointed to improving conditions for the rest of the region.\nHowever, an eventual recovery in China and in the region largely hinged upon the confirmation of an actual trade agreement between the United States and China along with rolling back of tariffs that were imposed last year, they said.\n\u201cThere is now a decent chance that growth in China will bottom out slightly earlier than we had anticipated, which would likely mean an improvement in conditions in the rest of the region in the months ahead,\u201d said Alex Holmes, Asia economist at Capital Economics.\n\u201cBut other data suggest that growth in China could well weaken again in the near term. As such, we think it is too soon to predict a turn in fortunes for the region\u2019s manufacturing sectors.\u201d\nIn particular, the manufacturing gauge for Southeast Asia returned to growth in March, driven by a bounce in Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and Myanmar. Indonesia\u2019s headline PMI rose from 50.1 to 51.2, Thailand\u2019s bounced up from 49.9 to 50.3 in February, and Vietnam\u2019s increased from 51.2 to 51.9.\nOther data suggest that growth in China could well weaken again in the near term. As such, we think it is too soon to predict a turn in fortunes for the region\u2019s manufacturing sectors\nAlex Holmes, Capital Economics\nJapan, South Korea and Taiwan PMIs also showed somewhat improving conditions in the manufacturing sector even though their readings stayed below the 50-level neutral mark. Taiwan\u2019s headline PMI rose from a multi-year low of 46.3 in February to 49.0 in March, and South Korea\u2019s PMI edged up to 48.8 in March from an almost four-year low of 47.2 in February.\nKorea\u2019s trade data typically provide a bellwether for regional growth, which showed that exports actually fell for the fourth consecutive month, sliding 8.2 per cent from a year earlier while imports contracted by 6.7 per cent.\n\u201cKorean PMI data may be telling us we are seeing the early stages of a turnaround, although export numbers are still in contraction territory and need a little bit more of time to turnaround,\u201d said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ. \u201cWe are watching closely on global semiconductor sales, they have fallen quite sharply in the last six months. So whether there are signs of that bottoming out will be important because that will give an indication of whether we are going to see a recovery in Asian export.\u201d\nSouth Korea-based Samsung Electronics, the world\u2019s largest memory chip maker, last week warned its earnings for the first quarter would be even worse than forecast due to falling chip prices and weakening global demand.\nJapan\u2019s PMI stood at 49.2 in March compared to February\u2019s 48.9. But Japan\u2019s Tankan Large Manufacturers Index of sentiment slid to 12 in the first quarter from 19 in the fourth quarter, missing the market consensus of 13, to record its weakest reading in two years.\nThe Tankan index surveys business sentiment of about 1,100 companies with capital over 1 billion yen (US$9 million). Participants are asked to evaluate trends and conditions in their respective industries. The index varies on a scale of -100 to 100, meaning a value above zero indicates business optimism and a value below zero pessimism.\nElsewhere, manufacturing PMI readings also fell in the Philippines, Malaysia and Myanmar. Malaysia\u2019s headline PMI fell from 47.6 in February to 47.2 in March, while its central bank last week hinted that interest rate cuts were on the cards after it lowered its growth forecast for this year to a range from 4.9 per cent to 4.8 to 4.3 per cent. The Philippines\u2019 PMI slipped from 51.9 to 51.5 and Myanmar\u2019s also eased from 53.1 to 52.4.\nStory continues Korean PMI data may be telling us we are seeing the early stages of a turnaround, although export numbers are still in contraction territory and need a little bit more of time to turnaround.\nKhoon Goh, ANZ\nCarlos Casanova, Asia-Pacific economist at credit insurer Coface, also noted that the consensus is also for India\u2019s central bank to cut interest rates soon given because of pressure to deliver an even bigger stimulus to the economy.\nChina has reportedly made concessions in the trade talks with the US on a range of issues including forced technology transfer and intellectual property protection, as the two sides work to strike a deal to end their protracted trade war.\nBut US President Donald Trump on Friday, after the latest round of talks took place in Beijing, said that he would not accept anything less than a \u201cgreat deal\u201d. A Chinese delegation led by Vice-Premier Liu He are set to resume trade talks in Washington this week.\n\u201cIf we get a positive confirmation of a trade deal between the US and China, that will definitely help in terms of the eventual recovery that we expect in the second half,\u201d added Khoon from ANZ Bank.\nMore from South China Morning Post:\nUS-China trade war inactivity could lead to the \u2018worst recession in recent Chinese history\u2019, says scholar China pours more money into cheap loans to help regions deal with debt pile and aid economy US and China trade negotiators hit the ground running with dinner diplomacy in Beijing Can China\u2019s bond inclusion on the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index save its slowing economy?

said on Monday that he wants the US to work with China to help stabilise and reduce uncertainty in global affairs, amid negotiations aimed at ending the countries\u2019 months-long trade war.\n\u201cAs big countries, our relationship with each other can have great impact on global strategic stability and we all shoulder special responsibilities [to the world],\u201d Xi told a visiting delegation of The Elders \u2013 an international non-governmental organisation of prominent public figures \u2013 during a meeting in Beijing.\nChina is a \u201cbig developing country\u201d but is willing to shoulder its share of international responsibilities, Xi was Quote: d as saying by China's state-owned Xinhua News Agency.\nYang Jiechi, a member of the Chinese politburo, and Foreign Minister Wang Yi joined Xi in meeting with a team of The Elders that included Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland, Ban Ki-moon, the former UN Secretary-General and former Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo.\nXi\u2019s comments at the Great Hall of the People came as his chief trade negotiator, Vice-Premier Liu He, prepared to travel to Washington this week for the latest round of talks aimed at bringing an end to the tariff battle between the world\u2019s largest economies that has cast a long shadow across the global economy.\nLiu met US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Beijing last week. But despite a growing belief that the sides may be getting closer to reaching a deal to end the trade friction, they remain far apart on core issues such as market access, an enforcement mechanism and the protection of intellectual property rights in China.\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said last week that the Trump administration is prepared to allow the talks to stretch on for \u201cmonths\u201d and is in no rush to resolve the dispute, which is about to enter its ninth month.\nThe bilateral trade war started on July 6, 2018 after the US government imposed punitive tariffs on steel and aluminium that had affected products from many countries.\nUS and China set for another round of trade talks next week\nXi, noting that China had striven to promote coordination among big countries, said that \u201cChina-US relations are one of the most important bilateral relations in the world today\u201d.\nHe said he hoped that the US could \u201cwalk with us in the same direction, manage our differences, expand cooperation, and develop a relationship that is built on the main themes of consultation, cooperation and stability so to bring greater certainty and predictability to global affairs\u201d.\nEmphasising China\u2019s interest in \u201cdeveloping [a] harmonious relationship\u201d with the US, Xi said: \u201c[Our goal] is to avoid confrontation and conflicts, promote mutual respect and cooperation so to achieve win-win for everyone.\u201d\nBut Xi took a thinly veiled swipe at US President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d strategy, emphasising the importance of nations getting along in \u201ca multilateral world\u201d.\nWhy the US-China trade teams are minding their language\nIn the spirit of cooperation, Xi said, China would continue to promote multilateralism by supporting initiatives such as the 2015 Paris climate accord from which the US withdrew soon after Trump\u2019s inauguration as president in 2017; and the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia that Trump announced this year the US would also leave. However, China was never a signatory to that cold war-era nuclear arms control treaty, better known as the INF.\n\u201cThe impact of current unilateralism has made many countries feel pressure and worry,\u201d Xi said.\nStory continues \u201cThe international community is in support of multilateralism. It is necessary to ensure that the existing multilateral process keeps on rolling.\u201d\nThe Chinese president also addressed critics of the Beijing-led Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a massive trade and infrastructure programme which recently added Italy to its list of member nations.\nFour steps the US and China can take to rebuild trust\nThe initiative has been under international scrutiny, painted as a tool of China\u2019s political agenda aimed at undermining Washington\u2019s global leadership and as a debt trap for emerging economies.\n\u201cChina seeks cooperation and is ready to offer help to the developing countries,\u201d Xi said, adding that BRI would bring mutual benefits to \u201call countries\u201d.\nThe programme was never designed to sideline a specific country, Xi said.\nMore from South China Morning Post:\nUS and China wrap up \u2018constructive\u2019 trade talks with pledge to meet again next week Why US and Chinese trade teams have to mind their language as talks get serious This article Xi Jinping urges US to work with China to preserve \u2018global stability\u2019 ahead of next round of trade war talks in Washington first appeared on South China Morning Post\nFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app .

While such a move is unlikely to halt immigration \u2014 legal or illegal \u2014 there are lots of surprising and problematic things that will happen if Trump closes the border .\nWhite House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney explained the administration's rationale for potentially closing the border on ABC's This Week.\n\u201c Why are we talking about closing the border? \u201d Mulvaney told ABC. \u201cNot to try and undo what\u2019s happening, but simply to say, \u2018look we need the people from the ports of entry to go out and patrol in the desert where we don\u2019t have a wall.\u2019\u201d\nWhat Mulvaney's explanation leaves out, however, is the fact that, it's not just people who cross the border between the United States and Mexico. As The Washington Post explained, it's a major point along the global trade routes, so closing the border would cause huge issues not only for companies involved in global trade, but also consumers who rely on their products. Many policy matters don't make an actual impact in your day to day life, but if Trump closes the border with Mexico, you might actually notice it. 1. There Would Be An Avocado Shortage Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nIf you like readily available avocado toast, then you don't like the idea of closing the Mexican border. To be specific, the United States would run out of avocados \u2014 and therefore guacamole, avocado toast, and any smoothie involving avocado \u2014 within three weeks if the border closes, according to Reuters.\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t pick a worse time of year because Mexico supplies virtually 100 percent of the avocados in the U.S. right now. California is just starting and they have a very small crop, but they\u2019re not relevant right now and won\u2019t be for another month or so,\u201d Steve Barnard, the president and CEO of top global avocado grower and distributor Mission Produce, told Reuters. 2. ... Along With Numerous Other Fruits & Veggies Mario Tama/Getty Images News/Getty Images\nIt's not just the country's avocado lovers who would suffer. Mexico supplies numerous fruits and veggies to American consumers, as The Hill wrote, and a border closure could hurt deliveries of all of them. If the border closes, expect to see prices for tomatoes, cucumbers, blackberries, and raspberries rise significantly, because Mexico is the biggest importer of all of them, according to NBC News. 3. Actually, There'd Be Problems With Fresh Food Across The Board Noam Galai/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\nThough Republicans (falsely) claimed that Democrats were trying to take away hamburgers in their criticism of the Green New Deal, a border closure could accomplish that far more quickly. Fresh food across the board \u2014 like beef \u2014 depends on open borders so that distributors can keep up their deliveries, which are timed very carefully. Delays caused by a closed border could cause any perishable food to go bad and clog up the border crossing, according to The Washington Post . 4. America's Auto Industry Would Suffer Bill Pugliano/Getty Images News/Getty Images\nAmerican car companies already suffered through the early stages of Trump's trade war with China, as CNBC wrote in August 2018, and this potential border closure would essentially be more of the same. As The Washington Post wrote, any disruption on a global trade route causes supply issues for companies \u2014 like automakers \u2014 that rely on products coming in from other countries. In this case, American automakers would have to scramble to get the supplies they need, and replacements with the same price are by no means guaranteed. 5. People Who Cross The Border Regularly Would Be Stuck Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News/Getty Images\nEveryday, thousands of people cross the border between the United States and Mexico simply as part of their commute. There are Mexican students who go to American schools , for example, U.S. citizens who live in Mexico but work in the States, or simply people who live in one country and often visit family in the other. If Trump closes the border, he would immediately be throwing these peoples' lives into turmoil. 6. Lawsuits Would Pour In Alex Wong/Getty Images News/Getty Images\nIf the border closes, a wave of lawsuits is likely to follow, according to The Washington Post . The companies that lose profit \u2014 in some cases even potentially having to lay off workers, according to the Post \u2014 would have grounds to sue the administration for violating their rights as companies to operate freely. Because of this, it's unlikely that a border closure would be able to last very long. 7. Immigration Would Not Decrease Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News/Getty Images\nTrump and Mulvaney's justification for closing the border is, of course, the idea of stopping immigration between Central America and the United States, as The New York Times wrote. With official crossing points closed, the argument goes, border patrol officers can pay more attention to the unmanned sections of the border. What this strategy ignores, however, is that the uptick in immigration has happened almost entirely at official ports of entry, as The Guardian wrote. Furthermore, undocumented migrants would not be deterred by the presence of more guards between ports of entry, as their aim is generally to turn themselves in and request asylum , as Vox explained.\nBasically, this move wouldn't make it any more difficult for an undocumented immigrant to cross into the United States. It would, however, throw up numerous obstacles for U.S. citizens who depend on an open border for aspects of their lives big and small, be it an education, a livelihood, or a tasty treat at brunch.

The plane's manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, said that contracts with Turkish companies to build parts for the F-35 had been expected to reach $12 billion.\nAmong the eight Turkish companies involved in the purchase, Ayesas has been building a panoramic cockpit display for the F-35 and Fokker Elmo makes 40 percent of the electrical wiring and interconnection system, according to Lockheed Martin.\nGROWING TILT TO RUSSIA\nThe purchase of a Russian system is highly unusual for a member of NATO, the Western alliance forged to counter the Soviet Union.\nThe US suspension announcement comes two days before foreign ministers from the 29 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are due in Washington to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the alliance -- and hours after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's AKP party suffered a surprise rout in elections in major cities including Istanbul.\nErdogan, whose relations with the West have soured sharply as he cracks down on dissent at home, has increasingly looked to Moscow as a partner. Russian tourists have made Turkey their top destination, providing a vital economic boost.\nLast week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov traveled to Turkey, where Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu insisted that the S-400 purchase would go ahead.\n\"We have an agreement with Russia and we are bound by it,\" Cavusoglu told reporters.\nHoping to offer an alternative, the United States last year approved the sale of Patriot missiles to Turkey -- a deal to which Ankara said it was open.\nFour senators last week proposed legally barring the transfer of F-35s to Turkey if it buys the S-400. One of the senators, Democrat Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, praised the Pentagon suspension and pledged to \"continue working in the Senate to prevent this dangerous possibility from becoming a reality.\"\nROCKY TIES WITH US\nTurkey's relations with the United States plunged last year when President Donald Trump imposed tariffs, battering Turkey's lira, over the jailing of an American pastor detained as part of a mass roundup following a coup attempt against Erdogan.\nThe pastor, Andrew Brunson, was freed and Trump appeared to grow fond of Erdogan, speaking to him before his sudden decision to withdrew US troops from Syria.\nBut tensions quickly resurfaced with the United States fearful that Erdogan will strike US-allied Kurdish fighters in Syria and a Turkish court trying a US consulate staffer, Metin Topuz, on charges of spying.\nTopuz, a Turkish citizen, is accused of ties to Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish preacher who lives in self-imposed exile in the United States. Erdogan has repeatedly demanded that the United States extradite Gulen, whom the Turkish leader accuses of fomenting the coup.\nsct/wd\n\u00a9 Agence France-Presse\nShare\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/overseas/04/02/19/us-suspends-f-35-program-deliveries-to-turkey-over-russian-arms", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=https://news.abs-cbn.com/overseas/04/02/19/us-suspends-f-35-program-deliveries-to-turkey-over-russian-arms&text=US%20suspends%20F-35%20program%20deliveries%20to%20Turkey%20over%20Russian%20arms", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://news.abs-cbn.com/overseas/04/02/19/us-suspends-f-35-program-deliveries-to-turkey-over-russian-arms"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "charles e. summers jr.", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "air force", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T07:51:28.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "26c19ad1cc666caa3125a250c04323f77cac8c84", "url": "https://hypestat.com/info/7z2d9.us", "site_full": "hypestat.com", "site": "hypestat.com", "site_section": "https://hypestat.com/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "HypeStat.com", "title": "7z2d9.us - 7z2d9", "title_full": "7z2d9.us - 7z2d9", "published": "2019-04-01T19:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7923, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "26c19ad1cc666caa3125a250c04323f77cac8c84", "url": "https://hypestat.com/info/7z2d9.us", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-01T19:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "7z2d9.us - 7z2d9", "text": "What sites are related to 7z2d9.us?

Jason Redmond, Reuters/File NEW YORK--Boeing must perform more work on a proposed fix to its 737 MAX aircraft before it can be submitted for review, US officials said Monday, suggesting the planes could stay grounded a while longer.\nAdditional work is needed \"to ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues,\" a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said in a statement.\n\"The FAA will not approve the software for installation until the agency is satisfied with the submission,\" he added.\nThe FAA statement is the bureaucratic equivalent of a \"stop\" sign after Boeing officials touted their proposed remedy last week during a media tour at the company's manufacturing plant in Seattle, Washington.\nBoeing's 737 MAX planes were grounded globally last month following the second of two deadly crashes to occur in less than five months.\nScrutiny has centered on an anti-stall system developed specifically for the planes that has given pilots problems.\nA preliminary report into the second calamity -- the March 10 crash of a Boeing 737 MAX 8 that killed 157 people -- will likely be issued this week, the Ethiopian government said Monday.\nBoeing last week gathered hundreds of pilots and reporters at its Renton, Washington manufacturing site for a presentation on proposed changes to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which is believed to have been a key factor in the Ethiopian crash and in an October crash of a Lion Air in Indonesia that killed 189 people.\nAmong the changes, the MCAS will no longer repeatedly make corrections when the pilot tries to regain control, and will automatically disconnect in the event of disagreements between the two \"angle of attack,\" or AOA sensors, the company said last week.\nBoeing is anxious to win approval for a proposed remedy that could get the planes back in the air.\nBut the FAA, which faced harsh questioning last week at a congressional hearing regarding its oversight of Boeing, said it expected Boeing to submit the proposed fix \"over the coming weeks\" after it undertakes additional work.\nAfter that, the proposal will be submitted to a \"rigorous safety review,\" the FAA spokesman said.\nA Boeing spokesman said Monday the company was continuing to work with regulators to address concerns.\n\"We are working to demonstrate that we have identified and appropriately addressed all certification requirements and will be submitting for FAA review once completed in the coming weeks,\" the Boeing spokesman said.\n\"Safety is our first priority and we will take a thorough and methodical approach to the development and testing of the update to ensure we take the time to get it right.\"\nPRELIMINARY REPORT THIS WEEK\nEarlier Monday, Ethiopian foreign ministry spokesman Nebiat Getachew had said his country's transport ministry would release \"a preliminary report into its investigation\" of the March 10 accident in which a Nairobi-bound Boeing 737 MAX crashed shortly after taking off from Addis Ababa.\nThe Ethiopian government gave no details on the exact timing of the release, nor hints about the report's findings.\nNebiat initially said the report would be released Monday but the transport ministry, which is in charge of investigations, later said this would take several days.\n\"The report will most likely be released some day later this week,\" ministry spokesman Mussie Yiheyes said.\nIt was not clear Monday if the transport ministry's preliminary report would be made public straight away, or limited to the eyes of authorities including the FAA.\nThe plane's black boxes are being examined by France's BEA air safety agency, working with American and Ethiopian investigators to determine what went wrong.\nANTI-STALL SYSTEM\nA source with knowledge of the investigation has said an anti-stalling system, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), was activated shortly before the crash.\nBoeing designed the automated MCAS system -- which lowers the aircraft's nose if it detects a stall or loss of airspeed -- for this particular model.\nThe same system was implicated in the October crash, with initial investigations finding that a sensor on the plane had transmitted incorrect information to the MCAS system.\nThe pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 struggled to control the aircraft as the MCAS repeatedly pushed the plane's nose down, according to the flight data recorder.\nThe pilot had tried repeatedly to regain control and pull the nose up but the plane crashed into the sea.\nBoth the planes in Indonesia and Ethiopia reportedly experienced erratic steep climbs and descents, as well as fluctuating airspeeds, before crashing shortly after takeoff.\nEthiopia has already said there were \"clear similarities\" between the two MAX 8 crashes.\nEthiopian Airlines is Africa's largest carrier and in many ways the international face of the nation.\nShare\nSave

hiring other conspirators (runners) to retrieve money wired by the victims to those runners; and/or hiring runners to open bank accounts into which victims deposited fraud proceeds, revealed the documents.\nThe defendants collected the proceeds by providing the runners with the victims' names, locations, and amounts paid.\nThe runners were directed to retrieve the fraud proceeds in cash and turn the funds over to the defendants, often less a payment to the runner for opening the account or conducting the transaction, according to the documents.\nFour others have already pleaded guilty for their roles in the scheme.\nOn March 25, Alejandro Juarez was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison.

Most of them make no bones about saying that wining the election is not their objective.\nAmong the first contenders against Modi is Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan , the president of the Bhim Army, a five-year-old Dalit organisation. Azad, who staged a road show in Varanasi on March 30 and declared that \u201cthe countdown to Modi\u2019s defeat has begun\u201d, attracts youths from the Dalit sections because of his fiery speeches.\nThe second unlikely opponent to Modi is former constable in the Border Security Force (BSF) Tej Bahadur Yadav, who made headlines after he uploaded a video last year criticising the allegedly sub-standard food served to BSF jawans.\nIn what appears to be an honest answer to justify his decision, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s only about the high-profile constituency that Varanasi is. I can use it as a platform to highlight concerns of troopers. I may not win, but I only want to send out a message.\u201d Yadav, who was dismissed from service after his allegations were declared false by a court of inquiry, plans to contest as an independent. Also willing to challenge Modi is a motley group of farmers from Tamil Nadu who had staged a demonstration in Delhi in 2017 to highlight their demands such as profitable prices for farm produce. The group, comprising 111 farmers, is led by P Ayyakannu.\nThe latest contender against Modi is again a group from down south. Two victims of fluorosis from Nalgonda (Telangana) and Prakasam (Andhra Pradesh), led by two activists, Vadde Srinivas and Jalagam Sudheer, are planning to join the fray.\n4th candidate in fray in Varanasi is a former professor\nAyyakannu has said that if their demand is included in the BJP manifesto, they will drop their decision to contest against Modi.\nThe fourth interesting candidate is a former professor and the mahant of Sankat Mochan temple in Varanasi. Vishambhar Nath Mishra, known for spearheading a prolonged struggle to clean the Ganga, has also said he will contest against Modi from Varanasi. While local reports said he might contest on a Congress party ticket, nothing has been officially confirmed.\nFluoride contamination of groundwater is a serious issue in the two states and the objective is to highlight it at a place where it will be heard, said Sudheer. The names of the victims are yet to be finalised.\n\u201cThe ailment affects physical movement. So, without making it difficult for them, we will take only those who can travel to Varanasi to file the nominations,\u201d added Sudheer.\n\u201cFluorosis has crippled the lives of people in Nalgonda. While the Telangana government has allocated eight acres for setting up a Regional Fluoride Mitigation Centre in Nalgonda, the Centre did not release the promised Rs 100 crore,\u201d Sudheer told TOI.\nVaranasi will go to polls on May 19. The nominations begin on April 22.\nTill then, more such candidatures may come up with more issues that need to be heard.\nThe Congress party and the SP-BSP combine are also expected to declare candidates soon. Those names, too, will be well-thought ones.\nIn 2014, when PM Modi had decided on Varanasi as his second constituency after Vadodara, Aam Aadmi Party chief and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had contested against him and lost by more than 3 lakh votes.\n(With inputs from Rohan Dua and Sushil Rao)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "modi", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "vara", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "dalit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "azad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chandrashekhar azad ravan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tej bahadur yadav", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "uttar pradesh lok sabha election news - times of india lucknow", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "border security force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhim army", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "varanasi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T08:05:56.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4647a135328de16fe1e56a16dd3fe105f6c1c4cf", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mexicos-top-security-officials-entered-us-illegally-62102207", "site_full": "abcnews.go.com", "site": "go.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.abcnews.com/abcnews/internationalheadlines", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "ABC News: International", "title": "Mexico's top security official says he entered US illegally", "title_full": "Mexico's top security official says he entered US illegally", "published": "2019-04-02T03:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_4a1bcd36038a4b9a9690f31cc8e52c49_16x9_992.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 72, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4647a135328de16fe1e56a16dd3fe105f6c1c4cf", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mexicos-top-security-officials-entered-us-illegally-62102207", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Mexico's top security official says he entered US illegally", "text": "Mexico's top security official says he twice crossed illegally into the United States in his youth to work.\nLa Jornada newspaper reported Monday that Public Safety Secretary Alfonso Durazo told a business gathering in the northern state of Sonora that out of economic necessity he went to the U.S. to wash cars and dishes.\nDurazo retweeted the newspaper's account Monday.

His efforts were shown to have come to full fruition in the snow-capped finale , with the Hilltop-settled Ezekiel sharing his story via shortwave radio with Judith in Alexandria. Celebrations aside, the more shocking moment occurred soon after, when someone else's voice came through the radio. Dun-dun-dun!\nThough the transmission was static-filled, this was what came through the speaker:\nHello? Hello? Calling out live on the open air. Is anybody out there?\nMany viewers were likely shocked to hear a new voice, including the comic readers who assumed that such a moment would occur at some point down the line. I'm guessing everybody would love to know what's going to happen next, too, since there's unlimited potential to be found in the prospect of another radio-friendly community existing out there somewhere.\nBefore diving into what the comics can tell us about this big moment, check out what Walking Dead showrunner Angela Kang told me about it.\nYou know, it's like, I can't spoil anything related to that. [laughs] But I'll say that when a mysterious radio voice is out there looking for people. I mean, we gotta do something with that story, right? So there will be some answers that happen in the next season, and it may or may not be what people expect. It should be a lot of fun, though. Knock on wood.\nConsidering we're still around seven months from the start of Season 10, it's to be expected that Angela Kang needs to stay mum about where any storylines might be headed regarding the radio's mystery caller. It's entirely possible that the voice might become the next recurring mystery for fans to wonder about, similar to the helicopter enigma , which still hasn't been fully explained.\nThankfully, we can fall back on the Walking Dead comic books to give us an idea of where the TV series could be heading with this leg of the storyline. What We Know From The Comics\nThe first big distinction between the TV show and the comic book narrative is the fact that no one heard the radio call in the Season 9 finale, while Eugene was sitting at the radio when the mystery voice came through on the page. That's already a wrench in the works for the TV characters, since it's not clear when or if anyone will ever be around to hear and respond to a call.\nEugene and his female radio contact don't immediately start sharing their deepest darkest secrets or anything, but their initial conversations are comfortable and easygoing. Despite that, a sense of creeping paranoia cloaks much of their communication process, since it's extremely rare for good things to come from sharing personal details with strangers. Especially in this universe.\nEugene soon explained Team Family's troubles with the Whisperers to the woman, sharing that they'd killed Rosita, who was his pregnant-for-another-man girlfriend in the comics. Feeling sympathetic, the woman chose then to reveal to Eugene that her name is Stephanie. And it's not much longer before each shared the location of their respective communities, with Stephanie's being somewhere within Ohio. (Start looking for those Ohio clues soon!)\nStephanie's story definitely develops and evolves beyond this in the source material, but it's not that likely that the TV show will reach this narrative point during Season 10. The TV show's protagonists are destined for a larger fight against the Whisperers, which the TV timeline mostly matching up with the comics', so there may not be much time for radio communication if everyone is caught up in the throes of battle.\nStephanie does end up being a trustworthy ally for the team, but that doesn't guarantee everything, or anything, will go the same way for the TV characters. Angela Kang and her creative team might very well decide to put a more villainous character on the other end of the radio. Someone that can take advantage of a lovesick Eugene in order to get him to reveal sensitive information about Alexandria and Hilltop.\nRegardless of whether or not the radio voice belongs to somebody that TV audiences will be able to trust, I just hope that person is the link that will connect Michonne and Alexandria back to Rick, and also then to Jadis and maybe even Heath. Granted, that stuff would likely play out in the upcoming standalone movies and not on the series, but the hope still remains.\nWithout more Walking Dead episodes to pay attention to in the upcoming months , be sure to bookmark our comprehensive guide for what fans can expect from Season 10.

Its chairwoman is Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland.\nMembers spoke highly of China's achievements in environmental protection, poverty reduction and ethnic relations and development.\nChina has played a constructive role as a responsible major country at a time when multilateralism is facing challenges, and Xi's speeches at international events have sent positive signals, they said.\nNoting that this year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Robinson said that China has made great progress in the recent decades, and she has seen great changes in China.\n\"We hope to really have a continuing dialogue with China on issues because they are quite urgent now,\" she said, adding that multilateralism is \"going through a difficult time\".", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "xi jinping", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nelson mandela", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "great hall of the people", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T08:15:51.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bedf17c5b25621284c1a1753b2c1bc29b178d5b8", "url": "https://ca.investing.com/news/forex-news/argentina-moves-again-to-bolster-the-worlds-weakest-currency-1433611", "site_full": "ca.investing.com", "site": "investing.com", "site_section": "https://ca.investing.com/news/forex-news", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Forex and Currency News - Investing.com Canada", "title": "Argentina Moves Again to Bolster the World's Weakest Currency By Bloomberg", "title_full": "Argentina Moves Again to Bolster the World's Weakest Currency By Bloomberg", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE8C20F_L.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 699, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bedf17c5b25621284c1a1753b2c1bc29b178d5b8", "url": "https://ca.investing.com/news/forex-news/argentina-moves-again-to-bolster-the-worlds-weakest-currency-1433611", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bloomberg", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Argentina Moves Again to Bolster the World's Weakest Currency By Bloomberg", "text": "\u00a9 Reuters. Argentina Moves Again to Bolster the World's Weakest Currency (Bloomberg) -- Argentina\u2019s central bank said it won\u2019t allow its key interest rate to drop below 62.5 percent in April, buttressing its campaign to protect the peso.\nThe commitment comes on top of the central bank\u2019s pledge to freeze the monetary supply until the end of the year to cool inflation, part of a record $56 billion credit agreement with the International Monetary Fund. The peso gained as much as 1.5 percent to 42.70 per dollar on Monday, tracking gains in other emerging markets.\nThe latest step comes after a renewed slump in the peso pushed it to a record low on March 27, threatening to fuel an inflation rate that stood at 51 percent in February. Price-growth has proved stubbornly high after the bank eased policy this year, allowing the key rate, known as Leliq, to fall below 60 percent throughout January and February. The rate now stands at 68.2 percent, the highest in the world.\n\"Perseverance in the strict control of the evolution of the monetary base will lead to a reduction in inflation in upcoming months,\" the bank said in a statement after a meeting of its monetary policy committee.\nAll the same, the central bank expects inflation to remain elevated in March and April, based on high-frequency data it monitors.\nToday\u2019s announcement is the latest twist in the past year for the bank, which has had three presidents and a complete policy overhaul on top of the IMF bailout. It pulled out emergency measures last year to handle Argentina\u2019s currency crisis and recession. The peso lost more than half its value against the dollar and the economy fell into recession as investor concern about the nation\u2019s deficits helped spark the peso\u2019s plunge.\nThe government and IMF have long forecast that the economy will start to rebound in the second quarter of this year, backed by Argentina\u2019s soy harvest and exports. Some analysts say a rebound can\u2019t take place with rates and inflation this high. Economic activity barely rose in January compared with December, and fell 5.7 percent from a year ago, according to data published last week.\nFighting inflation while implementing austerity measures is challenging President Mauricio Macri\u2019s bid for re-election this year. His approval ratings declined to 30 percent in March. Argentines will cast their vote on Oct. 27, with a potential runoff vote between the two top candidates set for Nov. 24.\nMeasures the bank took last month included:\nTargeting an additional 10 percent reduction in the monetary base Extending its target for zero growth in the monetary base until December Adjusting its currency band 1.75 percent a month, compared with 2 percent Reducing the amount of dollars the central bank can buy if the peso falls below the currency band floor to $50 million a day from $75 million Expanding the limit Leliq banks can hold (Adds background on central bank in 6th-8th paragraphs.)\nArgentina Moves Again to Bolster the World's Weakest Currency", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fca.investing.com%2Fnews%2Fforex-news%2Fargentina-moves-again-to-bolster-the-worlds-weakest-currency-1433611&title=Argentina+Moves+Again+to+Bolster+the+World%27s+Weakest+Currency&summary=", "https://invst.ly/afne0", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=179222828858436&u=https%3A%2F%2Fca.investing.com%2Fnews%2Fforex-news%2Fargentina-moves-again-to-bolster-the-worlds-weakest-currency-1433611&display=popup&ref=plugin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "leliq", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg \u00a9 reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "international monetary fund", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "argentina", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T08:16:44.056+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7e8630b2c0a8ad29aa03880cad145255671927db", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47782247", "site_full": "www.bbc.com", "site": "bbc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "US to investigate car firms Hyundai and Kia over vehicle fires - BBC News", "title_full": "US to investigate car firms Hyundai and Kia over vehicle fires - BBC News", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1678E/production/_106264029_kia.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 130, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7e8630b2c0a8ad29aa03880cad145255671927db", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47782247", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "US to investigate car firms Hyundai and Kia over vehicle fires - BBC News", "text": " US safety authorities will investigate nearly three million Hyundai and Kia vehicles over fires, in a move which could prompt mass recalls.\nThe inquiry by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) follows thousands of complaints about the \"non-crash fires\".\nIncidents involving fires are linked to one death and more than 100 injuries.\nIt raises fresh safety concerns with the South Korean automakers, which have already been subject to US scrutiny.\nThe NHTSA said fire issues and engine problems have affected around six million Hyundai and Kia vehicles since 2015.

Globally, there are 225 models.\n\"In China specifically, we are focused on auto,\" said Fisher, adding that the company decided on local production because it sensed an opportunity in the world's largest automotive market.\nNovelis's plant, in Changzhou, Jiangsu province, started to localize its products in 2014. With an annual capacity of 100,000 metric tons, it has been serving carmakers ranging from FAW-Volkswagen and Chery Jaguar Land Rover to SAIC Motor and startup Nio. The momentum of China's new energy vehicle market is becoming another driver of Novelis' business in the country. Last year, more than 1.2 million new energy cars were sold, accounting for about half of the world's total. The China Passenger Car Association expects the figure to rise to 1.7 million this year.\n\"We see a tremendous amount of new energy vehicles coming into the marketplace and when you think about that there is going be a correlation to lightening those vehicles to get either distance or put more features and content into the vehicle itself,\" he said.\nJames Liu, managing director of Novelis China, said China's dual credit policy, which requires carmakers to produce a certain quota of new energy vehicles and also to meet the 2020 fuel consumption standard of five liters per 100 kilometers, will spur faster and wider adoption of aluminum products.\nBased on that judgment, the carmaker started a project late last year to expand its Changzhou plant with an investment of $180 million.\nThe annual capacity of the plant will be doubled to 200,000 tons when the project is completed in 2020.\n\"This investment will allow us to better serve our automotive customers by providing world-class manufacturing capabilities, products that meet global quality standards, and innovative solutions to make vehicles lighter, safer and stronger,\" said Liu.\nDespite a fall in China's vehicle sales last year, Novelis remains bullish about the market.\n\"It certainly will not affect our investment plans, because we're looking at this on a long-term basis,\" said Fisher.\n\"If there's a short-term pullback in the market, you know we're well positioned on a global basis to deal with that.\n\"But, certainly, we see the tremendous amount of opportunity and growth on a long-term basis. So, it would not deter us from our investment here in China.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fisher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve fisher", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "novelis inc", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "novelis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states-based", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T08:28:47.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "76812cf8f91373da3a3f12a4acee09d3a6a98774", "url": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1108462/US-navy-washington-military-trump-destroyers-aircraft-submarine-ww3", "site_full": "www.express.co.uk", "site": "express.co.uk", "site_section": "http://express.co.uk//posts/rss/78/world", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Daily Express :: World Feed", "title": "US Navy announces plans to rapidly expand military capabilities in stark warning", "title_full": "US Navy announces plans to rapidly expand military capabilities in stark warning", "published": "2019-04-02T01:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/750x445/1108462.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1796, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 8}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "76812cf8f91373da3a3f12a4acee09d3a6a98774", "url": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1108462/US-navy-washington-military-trump-destroyers-aircraft-submarine-ww3", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T01:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "US Navy announces plans to rapidly expand military capabilities in stark warning", "text": "Over the next 15 years the US Navy will increase its fleet of Destroyers in order to launch long-range attacks, fire interceptor missiles and engage in open water warfare.The plans outlined by Washington will increase its Naval vessels by more than 30 as well as eight additional combat aircrafts.

| US news", "text": "After accusations of inappropriate physical contact from several women, Democrats are asking whether Biden is a \u2018relic of the past\u2019. S ome presidential campaigns take time to hit their stride while others hit the ground running. But Joe Biden appears to be hobbling even before he reaches the starting blocks.\nThe past week has delivered a barrage of damaging news reports that might persuade the former vice president, long agonising over whether to make a third bid for the White House, to keep procrastinating a little while longer.\nLucy Flores, a former Nevada state assemblywoman, wrote an essay for the Cut in which she recalled a 2014 encounter in which Biden touched her shoulders, leaned in to smell her hair and kissed the back of her head. In a subsequent interview on CNN, Flores said such behavior should be \u201cdisqualifying\u201d for a presidential candidate.\nBiden denies inappropriate behavior after claim he kissed Nevada lawmaker Read more\nOn Monday, a second woman came forward. Amy Lappos, a Democratic aide, told the Associated Press (AP) that she was at a fundraiser in Hartford, Connecticut, in 2009 when Biden \u201cwrapped both his hands around my face and pulled me in. I thought, \u2018Oh, God, he\u2019s going to kiss me.\u2019 Instead, he rubbed noses with me.\u201d She described him as \u201cabsolutely disrespectful of my personal boundaries\u201d.\nThis setback followed a backlash last week after the Axios website reported that some of Biden\u2019s advisers were considering linking his campaign announcement with a promise to select Stacey Abrams, a rising star who unsuccessfully ran for Georgia governor last year, as his running mate. Critics found this patronising towards an African American woman who might run for president herself. Abrams responded: \u201cYou don\u2019t run for second place.\u201d\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lucy Flores accused Joe Biden of inappropriately kissing her on the back of the head and smelling her hair at a political event in 2014. Photograph: John Locher/AP\nMeanwhile, Biden made his latest attempt to express regret for how the Senate judiciary committee, which he chaired at the time, handled Anita Hill\u2019s sexual harassment allegations against supreme court nominee Clarence Thomas. At the Biden Courage Awards in New York, he said: \u201cTo this day, I regret I couldn\u2019t come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved.\u201d Some found the comments inadequate and called on Biden to apologise to Hill directly.\nAnd conservative media refocused attention on past reports about his son Hunter Biden\u2019s links to a Ukrainian oligarch and natural gas company in 2014. It has all been a brutal reminder that this 76-year-old white male centrist, though performing strongly in early polls, can take nothing for granted in a party where the energy is with women, minorities and young progressives. The 2020 election will not be fought in his comfort zone.\nWendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University, said: \u201cTwenty to forty-year-olds don\u2019t know any of his history; they only know him as Barack Obama\u2019s vice-president. So when they hear these things, it is completely out of context. That\u2019s the challenge for Biden. He\u2019s explaining himself to an electorate that doesn\u2019t really know him.\n\u201cWhen he says he\u2019s willing to consider Stacey Abrams as VP, women of colour and women in general are offended because they don\u2019t assume she has to be number two. It\u2019s a generational obstacle for Biden because the good stuff he\u2019s done is unknown and the bad stuff he\u2019s done is on video.\u201d\nSchiller added: \u201cTo young people, Joe Biden is an old white guy who now, it appears, views women as less than equal and feels able to treat them inappropriately. It\u2019s a sign of the times. He is running up against two generations of Democratic activists who regard him as a relic of the past.\u201d\nPlay Video 2:42 Has Joe Biden's US presidential bid ended before it began? \u2013 video explainer\nPerpetually hands-on and whispering-in-ears, Biden describes himself as a \u201ctactile politician\u201d. Video of him touching women has previously been dubbed \u201cthe audacity of grope\u201d by Comedy Central\u2019s The Daily Show. A moment of reckoning was inevitable in the era of the MeToo era movement. But few predicted it would come before Biden\u2019s even launched his candidacy.\nCoby Owens, chief executive of Youth Caucus of America, said: \u201cHe\u2019s always been very touchy feely. Every person has a different perspective on where the line is and what he did might have crossed it. We should respect Lucy Flores\u2019s experiences. It\u2019s something he needs to come out and address and apologise for if he made her uncomfortable.\u201d\nOwens, a civil rights activist, is based in Biden\u2019s home state of Delaware. \u201cI don\u2019t think this will turn people off in Delaware but, nationally, people are looking towards other candidates,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my inner circle, I know people have started talking about Beto O\u2019Rourke or even John Hickenlooper.\u201d\nBiden has been forced into damage control mode. After Flores spoke out, he responded that he has never intentionally behaved inappropriately during his many years in public life. \u201cIf it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have arrived at an important time when women feel they can and should relate their experiences, and men should pay attention. And I will.\u201d\nI don\u2019t think that this disqualifies him from running for president, not at all.\nNancy Pelosi There was a chorus of support including Susan Rice, a former national security adviser, Meghan McCain, daughter of the late senator John McCain, and Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, who told the AP: \u201cI don\u2019t think that this disqualifies him from running for president, not at all.\u201d\nIndeed, despite the rocky build-up, it would be premature to write Biden off. He has name recognition, that long association with Obama, vast foreign policy experience, numerous friends in the Democratic establishment and a perceived appeal to blue collar workers who deserted the party for Donald Trump in key Midwest states in 2016.\nLarry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: \u201cThis is a marathon, not a sprint, and there\u2019s a lot of time. If Biden is able to lock down 20 to 25% of the electorate, it\u2019s going to be very hard for any other candidates to catch him as the field is so widely spread.\u201d\nAn example of the ex-vice president\u2019s likely support base came at a recent firefighters\u2019 convention where he was greeted by chants of, \u201cRun Joe, run!\u201d Speaking to the Guardian early last week, Harold Schaitberger, president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, said: \u201cHe has the voice \u2013 a voice that connects to the working class... and that the current president was able to steal away from the Democratic party.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Lauren Gambino.\nTopics Joe Biden US politics features", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.thecut.com/2019/03/an-awkward-kiss-changed-how-i-saw-joe-biden.html", "https://watson.brown.edu/people/faculty-fellows/schiller", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/joe-biden-on-anita-hill-to-this-day-i-regret-i-couldnt-come-up-with-a-way-to-get-her-the-kind-of-hearing-she-deserved/2019/03/26/961ab43c-5028-11e9-a3f7-78b7525a8d5f_story.html?utm_term=.b143d3ecf42b", "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/30/joe-biden-2020-candidate-1244375", "https://twitter.com/CobyJOwens?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor", "https://twitter.com/AmbassadorRice/status/1112875988097134603", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/nancy-pelosi-inappropriate-touching-allegations-dont-disqualify-biden-from-being-president", "https://www.hhh.umn.edu/directory/lawrence-jacobs", "https://twitter.com/MeghanMcCain/status/1112903229560508416", "http://www.cc.com/video-clips/yfmksi/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-the-audacity-of-grope", "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/world/europe/corruption-ukraine-joe-biden-son-hunter-biden-ties.html", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Joe%20Biden", "https://www.axios.com/2020-presidential-election-joe-biden-stacey-abrams-vp-54472f8f-5bb2-4d1f-bc7c-0544a09ebba5.html", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-faces-new-scrutiny-from-dems-over-behavior-with-women/2019/03/31/c0829c9e-5415-11e9-aa83-504f086bf5d6_story.html?utm_term=.3c01e027f3df"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joe biden", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lucy flores", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "biden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy lappos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flores", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "white house", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hartford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T08:33:47.039+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aa853a76026d0187aa3790b6520d4abeba280337", "url": "http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201904/01/WS5ca226c9a3104842260b3c49.html", "site_full": "www.chinadaily.com.cn", "site": "chinadaily.com.cn", "site_section": "http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world", "site_categories": ["media", "travel", "japan"], "section_title": "World News - International Headlines &amp;#38; Foreign Policy News - China Daily", "title": "A first in US: NYC adopts congestion toll - World", "title_full": "A first in US: NYC adopts congestion toll - World - Chinadaily.com.cn", "published": "2019-04-01T17:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 73, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aa853a76026d0187aa3790b6520d4abeba280337", "url": "http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201904/01/WS5ca226c9a3104842260b3c49.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "\u5f90\u9e64", "published": "2019-04-01T17:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "A first in US: NYC adopts congestion toll - World", "text": "Vehicles wait for a green light on Fifth Avenue in New York City on Sunday. The city will use electronic tolling devices to collect fees on its most heavily used streets. ZHANG YUAN / CHINA DAILY Big Apple plans to use revenue to bolster failing subway system, officials say\nNew York City has become the first city in the US to adopt congestion pricing on vehicles that enter its busiest streets, with most of the anticipated $1 billion in revenue from the toll targeted at securing bonds to fix the city's troubled subway system.\nNew York will join London, Stockholm and Singapore, which already have congestion pricing on vehicles entering central parts of their cities to reduce traffic and air pollution, and especially for New York, to improve its aging subways.\nCongestion pricing for Manhattan was approved on Sunday as part of a new $175.5 billion state budget passed by the state Legislature. The measure creates a board to govern the congestion pricing plan, which is set to begin Dec 31, 2020.\nUnder the plan, vehicles entering Manhattan from 60th Street in Midtown south to Battery Park will be charged once per day through electronic tolling devices installed at points of entry to the zone.\nThe board will make recommendations on toll rates and possible exemptions. Earlier proposals have suggested a daily fee of around $12 for most passenger vehicles and up to $25 for trucks, with possible discounts based on time of day and day of the week.\nLast month, a first step toward congestion pricing went into effect with a $2.50 charge for taxis and $2.75 for ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft entering Manhattan at 96th Street. Those surcharges, paid by passengers, were approved by lawmakers last year.\n\"One month of suffering under the congestion surcharge, incomes are already down 15 percent,\" said the New York Taxi Workers Alliance in a statement. \"Tax the rich not the poor.\"\nCity officials say the new toll could raise about $1 billion a year, which would then be used to secure bonds totaling $15 billion for repairs and improvements to the subway system.\nTransit officials say at least $40 billion is needed to modernize the system, which carries an average 5.6 million riders each weekday.\n\"This is the right thing to do. The city is in crisis right now \u2014 both below and above ground,\" said Samuel Schwartz, who served as the city's traffic commissioner from 1982 to 1986 and was dubbed \"Gridlock Sam''.\n\"Above ground, the traffic is the worst it's ever been,\" Schwartz told China Daily. \"We have [average] speeds of 4.7 mph in midtown Manhattan \u2014 people can walk faster [than that]. And you often see people in taxi cabs getting out and just walking the final blocks to the destination because they're stuck in traffic.\"\nCongestion pricing was first proposed by then-mayor Michael Bloomberg more than a decade ago. But it wasn't until two years ago, when New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced his support for the idea, that it started to gain acceptance by other state and city politicians.\nIt has garnered even more support as the city's subway system has further deteriorated and traffic congestion has grown worse.\nThe new toll has caused concern among people who drive into Manhattan for work.\n\"For them, if they're not close to a subway or bus, this creates potentially a very big obstacle,\" William Eimicke, a professor of public affairs at Columbia University, told China Daily.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "china daily big apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "legislature", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fifth avenue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stockholm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "midtown", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T08:40:36.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fd202f33de5b6e7c85fe049e57e530eafa4a78d4", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47782247", "site_full": "www.bbc.co.uk", "site": "bbc.co.uk", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "US to investigate car firms Hyundai and Kia over vehicle fires - BBC News", "title_full": "US to investigate car firms Hyundai and Kia over vehicle fires - BBC News", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1678E/production/_106264029_kia.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 108, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fd202f33de5b6e7c85fe049e57e530eafa4a78d4", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47782247", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "US to investigate car firms Hyundai and Kia over vehicle fires - BBC News", "text": "Image copyright Getty Images US safety authorities will investigate nearly three million Hyundai and Kia vehicles over fires, in a move which could prompt mass recalls.\nThe inquiry by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) follows thousands of complaints about the \"non-crash fires\".\nIncidents involving fires are linked to one death and more than 100 injuries.\nIt raises fresh safety concerns with the South Korean automakers, which have already been subject to US scrutiny.\nThe NHTSA said fire issues and engine problems have affected around six million Hyundai and Kia vehicles since 2015.

The programme found that 47 per cent of children in the first eight pilot schools were \"at risk of mental unwellness\" on two standard testing scales. That number dropped to 36 per cent after the 10-week Jade Speaks Up programme which teaches children how to recognise and \"name\" their emotions, how to keep themselves safe in scary situations, and how to support each other through problems. But it is still far higher than Ministry of Health data showing that 8 per cent of NZ children aged 3 to 14 had \"concerning\" social, emotional and behavioural difficulties across its last three surveys from 2012 to 2016. Altogether, 28 per cent of children had \"concerning\" scores for at least one of the four categories of emotional symptoms, peer problems, hyperactivity or conduct problems. \"This is an epidemic that we are dealing with,\" said Jade Speaks Up co-author Elaine Dyer, a former chief executive of Violence Free Waitakere. Her co-author Andrea O'Hagan, a Whakat\u0101ne educational consultant, said schools could no longer ignore students' mental health. \"If you are stressed or sitting in a place of anxiety or worry from the past, you can't apply yourself so well to any new learning,\" she said. Yet Jenni Rodan, a teacher at one of the pilot schools, Waik\u014dwhai Intermediate in Mt Roskill, said teachers were not trained to help anxious and stressed children. \"It's such a difficult subject that sometimes it can be put in the too-hard basket,\" she said. WHERE TO GET HELP: If you are worried about your or someone else's mental health, the best place to get help is your GP or local mental health provider. However, if you or someone else is in danger or endangering others, call police immediately on 111.

Reuters | Apr 02, 2019, 10.59 AM IST 0 Comments AP In this Sept. 2, 2015, file photo, an F-35 jet flies over its new operational base at Hill Air Force Base, in northern Utah. WASHINGTON: The United States has halted delivery of equipment related to the stealthy F-35 fighter aircraft to Turkey , marking the first concrete U.S. step to block delivery of the jet to the NATO ally in light of Ankara's planned purchase of a Russian missile defense system. U.S. officials told their Turkish counterparts they will not receive further shipments of F-35 related equipment needed to prepare for the arrival of the stealthy jet, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday. The Pentagon confirmed the Reuters report that the equipment delivery had been stopped. \"Pending an unequivocal Turkish decision to forgo delivery of the S-400, deliveries and activities associated with the stand-up of Turkey's F-35 operational capability have been suspended,\" Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Mike Andrews, a Defense Department spokesman, said in a statement. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has refused to back down from Ankara's planned purchase of a Russian S-400 missile defense system that the United States has said would compromise the security of F-35 aircraft. The disagreement over the F-35 is the latest of a series of diplomatic disputes between the United States and Turkey including Turkish demands that the United States extradite Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, differences over Middle East policy and the war in Syria, and sanctions on Iran. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the next shipment of training equipment, and all subsequent shipments of F-35 related material, had been canceled. The aircraft is built by Lockheed Martin Corp. A Pentagon official had told Reuters in March that the United States had a number of items it could withhold in order to send Turkey a signal that the United States was serious about Ankara dropping its ambition to own the S-400. Turkish officials in Ankara were not immediately available for comment. Turkey has said it will take delivery of the S-400s in July. NATO SUMMIT The U.S. decision on the F-35s was expected to complicate Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu's visit to Washington this week for a NATO summit. On Sunday, Erdogan suffered one of his biggest electoral losses in decades in local elections. \"Certain Russian weapon systems are seen as inherently threatening to the United States regardless of who is operating them and for what purpose,\" Andrew Hunter, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said. \"Because Turkey is not just an F-35 purchaser, but an industrial partner, blocking delivery of these systems represents a major escalation by the United States as it threatens to impose serious costs on both sides,\" Hunter said. Reuters reported last week that Washington was exploring whether it could remove Turkey from production of the F-35. Turkey makes parts of the fuselage, landing gear and cockpit displays. Sources familiar with the F-35's intricate worldwide production process and U.S. thinking on the issue last week said Turkey's role can be replaced. The United States and other NATO allies that own F-35s fear the radar on the Russian S-400 missile system will learn how to spot and track the jet, making it less able to evade Russian weapons. In an attempt to persuade Turkey to drop its plans to buy the S-400, the United States offered the pricier American-made Patriot anti-missile system in a discounted deal that expired at the end of March. Turkey has shown interest in the Patriot system, but not at the expense of abandoning the S-400. Turkey has engaged with U.S. negotiators in recent days about buying the Patriot system, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The system is made by Raytheon Co. Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar in March said that despite some issues, Turkish pilots were continuing their training at an air base in Arizona on the F-35, each of which costs $90 million, and that Ankara was expecting the aircraft to arrive in Turkey in November. By halting jet deliveries, the Pentagon could subsequently delay training of Turkish pilots. Two additional jets are scheduled to arrive in Arizona in April and a significant delay could impact Turkey's November target date for operations. U.S. lawmakers also have expressed alarm over Turkey's planned purchase of the Russian system. Four U.S. senators last week introduced a bipartisan bill that would prohibit the transfer of F-35s to Turkey until the U.S. government certifies that Ankara will not take delivery of the S-400 system. Following news of the halt, U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, one of the bill sponsors, said she was glad to hear the administration was \"to delay the transfer of F-35 equipment to Turkey to help ensure U.S. military technology and capabilities cannot fall into the hands of the Kremlin.\" 0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.ecoti.in/x7bRIa", "http://www.ecoti.in/PWbHWa", "http://www.ecoti.in/YADbgZ16", "http://www.ecoti.in/m_Inxb"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mike andrews", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defense department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T08:53:48.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b9a85707e54fcaef531d74669b0d70e00fe750b9", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/news/3447508-white-mountains-nsm-buys-embrace-pet-insurance", "site_full": "seekingalpha.com", "site": "seekingalpha.com", "site_section": "https://seekingalpha.com/market-news/m-a", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "mutual_funds"], "section_title": "M&amp;A News | Seeking Alpha", "title": "White Mountains' NSM buys Embrace Pet Insurance - White Mountains Insurance Group, Ltd.
