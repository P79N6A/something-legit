But the slowdowns caused huge backups of trucks and cars, threatening to strangle the movement of goods and people.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get this back to normal very soon, it is going to have an economic cost for both countries,\u201d warned Foreign Relations Secretary Marcelo Ebrard.\nThe city government of Ciudad Juarez said so many trucks were backed up at border freight crossing there that they began to crowd some of the city\u2019s main boulevards, \u201ccausing losses for shopkeepers and creating traffic problems.\u201d\nCity police organized long single-file lines of trucks on some less-used freeways along the city\u2019s edges.

Weak sales of cars, harsh winter weather and the partial government shutdown also had an impact.\n\u201cWe can now confidently say new vehicle sales are past their peak,\u201d said Jeremy Acevedo, Edmunds.com\u2019s manager of industry analysis. \u201cWith new vehicle prices continuing to rise, interest rates sustaining post-recession highs and leasing growing increasingly expensive, pressure on the market is mounting.\u201d\nMost analysts are predicting vehicle sales of around 16.9 million this year, still strong but down from last year\u2019s 17.27 million. Sales peaked in 2016 at 17.55 million.\nPrices are a big factor. The National Automobile Dealers\u2019 Association reported that the average new vehicle sales price was $36,410 in the end of the first quarter, up 3.3% from a year ago. Auto-loan interest rates, on average, hit their highest point in a decade at 6.36%, up from 5.66% a year ago, according to Edmunds, which provides content to The Associated Press.\nArticle Continued Below The report of falling sales came a day after the Commerce Department reported that retail sales dropped 0.2% in February as consumers pulled back from spending on building materials, groceries, furniture, electronics and clothing.\nThe recent dip in auto sales and consumer spending suggests more Americans are tightening their belts amid slowing global growth and waning effects of President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts at the end of 2017.\nAnalysts for Cox Automotive said the economy is seeing rapid deceleration from a peak in growth during the past year. Gross domestic product growth hit 4.2% in last year\u2019s second quarter, but has slowed since. A revision in fourth-quarter figures took growth to 2.2%.\nThe U.S. economy also is affected by a slowing global economy that\u2019s been hit by trade uncertainties, the Cox analysts said.\nCharles Chesbrough, senior economist for Cox Automotive, said Americans have bought 85 million new vehicles during the past five years. \u201cThere\u2019s not that much demand that\u2019s left unfulfilled out there,\u201d he said. \u201cWere in the late stages of this business cycle.\u201d\nPlus, Chesbrough said he expects a record 4.1 million vehicles to return to the market this year largely from two- and three-year leases. That gives consumers a choice to buy late-model vehicles at around a 40% discount from new ones, he said.\nBut even with a decline this quarter, auto sales are still healthy. Patrick Manzi, senior economist with the dealers\u2019 association, said that although consumer confidence is waning, it remains high, showing that consumers still are willing to make large purchases. Also, job gains have been steady and wage growth has been accelerating.\nArticle Continued Below Here\u2019s how major automakers fared from January through March:\n\u2014 General Motors, down 7% to 665,840. Chevrolet Silverado pickup sales were off 15.7%, and it was bumped from its normal spot as the nation\u2019s No. 2-selling vehicle by the Ram pickup.\n\u2014 Ford sales fell 1.5% to 572,707.\n\u2014 Toyota, down 5% to 543,716.

U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n will run for New Mexico's open U.S. Senate seat in 2020. The 46-year-old Democrat announced his Senate bid Monday, April 1, 2019, in a video posted on Twitter that takes aim at Republican Senate leadership. Luj\u00e1n hails from a prominent New Mexico political family and helped his party retake the U.S. House majority in 2018 midterm elections. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) More SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n \u2014 the No. 4 ranked Democrat in Congress \u2014 announced his campaign Monday for the state's open U.S. Senate seat in 2020. Democrats hope to keep their hold on the seat held by Sen. Tom Udall, who announced last week that he won't seek a third term. He announced his Senate bid Monday on Twitter, touting his record on voting rights and consumer protection while criticizing the Senate's Republican majority leader. \"To move forward, we've got to fix the Senate where Mitch McConnell stands in the way of progress,\" Luj\u00e1n said. Luj\u00e1n is the first politician to declare his candidacy for the Senate seat. A former chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Luj\u00e1n first won election when Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, supporting Obama's recession-era stimulus package and health care overhaul. In a conversation with The Associated Press on Monday, Luj\u00e1n emphasized the importance of Democratic efforts to defend access to health insurance \"no matter how much money you make or what area code you live in.\" \"We're working to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and address all the sabotage we've seen from House Republicans, Senate Republicans as well as the Trump administration,\" said Luj\u00e1n, who has sponsored legislation that would allow a buy-in option for Medicaid coverage for those who don't otherwise qualify. Trump last week revived the fight over the Affordable Care Act in declaring that the \"Republican Party will soon be known as the party of health care.\" Luj\u00e1n readily won reelection in recent years while campaigning to advance immigration reform, combat climate change and address the state's crisis of opioid addiction and drug overdose deaths. Luj\u00e1n is a close ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and this year seized a coveted seat at the leadership table as the assistant speaker. Pelosi all but endorsed the decision to run for Senate. When Luj\u00e1n entered the Democrats' regular leadership meeting last week after Udall's announcement he would retire, Pelosi welcomed him as \"Senator Luj\u00e1n,\" according to a person granted anonymity to discuss the private session. Luj\u00e1n currently holds the northern New Mexico congressional seat that was a political stepping stone for Udall and Democrat Bill Richardson \u2014 the former governor, U.S. Cabinet secretary and U.N. ambassador. Udall left the House of Representatives in 2008 when he succeeded Republican Pete Domenici in the Senate. Luj\u00e1n hails from a prominent New Mexico political family that includes Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a distant cousin by marriage, as well as his father, Ben Luj\u00e1n, who was the state's House speaker for over a decade. The elder Luj\u00e1n served in New Mexico's unsalaried Legislature from 1974 until shortly before his death in 2012. In Monday's video announcement, the 46-year-old Lujan described his parents' working class ties as a union iron worker and a retired local school teacher. A conservative-leaning watchdog group filed an ethics complaint in 2015 that accused Luj\u00e1n of utilizing the House chamber to raise money for campaign purposes, citing the use of photos from a sit-in against gun violence in solicitation emails. The House Ethics Committee found no violation of rules and said the emails were sent by a campaign consultant without evidence that Luj\u00e1n was aware. Luj\u00e1n said Monday that the inquiry showed no infraction from the emails that emerged from a group event. \"There was someone on the (outside) team that made that decision to move forward with a fundraising email,\" he said. Some of the state's prominent Democratic office-holders already have indicated they will not compete for the Senate seat. New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas last week ruled out a Senate bid, citing personal and professional reasons, and Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller has said he is focused on his current job. No Republican has entered the race. ___ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom udall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben ray luj\u00e1n", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luj\u00e1n", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "house", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "us senate", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dccc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyatt regency hotel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T03:24:39.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7de3e7bf50c6a0a0bcbb2049bbaa3407d814c5e3", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2019/04/02/stock-indexes-end-day-mixed/wuI2gzzHnnyl4HCzjCywpK/story.html", "site_full": "www.bostonglobe.com", "site": "bostonglobe.com", "site_section": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Boston Globe", "title": "US stock indexes end the day mixed", "title_full": "US stock indexes end the day mixed - The Boston Globe", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2402, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7de3e7bf50c6a0a0bcbb2049bbaa3407d814c5e3", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2019/04/02/stock-indexes-end-day-mixed/wuI2gzzHnnyl4HCzjCywpK/story.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bostonglobe.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "US stock indexes end the day mixed", "text": " Associated Press April 02, 2019\nA day of listless trading ended with an uneven finish for US stock indexes as the market lost some of its momentum after a three-day winning streak.\nAfter a brief early slide, stocks mostly wavered between small gains and losses, as gains for some big technology companies were offset by losses in other sectors.\nConsumer products companies took some of the heaviest losses, led by drugstore chain operator Walgreens Boots Alliance, which plunged after it slashed its forecast following a weak quarter.

By Candice Choi Associated Press April 02, 2019\nNEW YORK \u2014 With keto-friendly recipes sweeping social media, some followers of low-carb eating are hoping for a nod of approval in the upcoming US dietary guidelines that advise Americans on what to eat.\nIt may seem minor, but backers say low-carb\u2019s inclusion could influence nutrition advice that doctors give and help shape government food programs like school lunches. Currently, the guidelines cite the Mediterranean, vegetarian, and other diets as examples of healthy eating.\n\u2018\u2018The main point is to get away from a one-size-fits-all diet,\u2019\u2019 said Nina Teicholz, who has written about low-carb diets.\nAdvertisement Last year, US health officials said low-carb diets will be reviewed along with other eating styles for the 2020 update to the guidelines. Backers are hopeful because the panel of experts selected to review the evidence includes members nominated by Atkins Nutritionals and a beef industry group. The group had its first meeting last week and is expected to issue a report to help shape the guidelines by next year.\nGet The Weekender in your inbox: The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond. Low carb\u2019s consideration comes amid skepticism of nutrition research for producing confusing advice. Low-carb supporters say rising obesity rates show conventional wisdom about nutrition, reflected in the guidelines, doesn\u2019t work for everyone.\nSome nutrition experts caution that evidence for low-carb diets is new and that it\u2019s unclear what the long-term effects might be. They say criticism of the guidelines is overblown, and blame the food industry for distorting messages to market low-fat snacks full of sugar and massive portions. They note the guidelines have cautioned against sugar since they were introduced in 1980, and that key recommendations have been largely consistent and remain sound.\nLow-carb diets generally limit foods like bread, pasta, and sugar to less than 30 percent of calories, or around 750 calories for someone eating 2,500 calories a day. The idea of restricting carbohydrates has been around for decades, and many remember the Atkins craze. The ketogenic diet has been used to treat people with epilepsy and has resurfaced as a very low-carb diet embraced by celebrities.\nCharles Garrison, a mortgage officer in Florida, decided to try the keto diet, including food like waffles made with almond flour.\nAdvertisement \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t plan on being super strict about it forever,\u2019\u2019 he said.\nLow-carb diets can work well for people with type 2 diabetes who are more sensitive to carbohydrates. But the benefits of low-carb can also be overblown, and people still have to make sure their overall diet is healthy, said Kevin Hall of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\nSome nutrition experts say sticking to low-carb diets can be hard, and that people should make changes that can last. Marion Nestle, a nutrition researcher who helped write the 1995 guidelines, said she prefers guidance that encourages healthy habits, such as the types of food to eat or limit.\n\u2018\u2018People don\u2019t eat nutrients, they eat food,\u2019\u2019 she said.\nAdding low-carb diets could further muddle messages. The guidelines, now more than 120 pages, also advise people to limit the saturated fat commonly found in meat and butter \u2014 foods many link with low-carb diets.\nAdvertisement Instead of adding another diet to the mix, simplifying the guidelines would be more useful, said Stanford University health policy researcher John Ioannidis.\n\u2018\u2018If we eat more, that will make us obese. That\u2019s 100 percent correct,\u2019\u2019 he said.\nLoading comments...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Ffood-dining%2F2019%2F04%2F02%2Fexperts-reviewing-low-carb-other-diets-for-guidelines%2F4kjju3FUa9oQWzXhTgj4PK%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=US", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Ffood-dining%2F2019%2F04%2F02%2Fexperts-reviewing-low-carb-other-diets-for-guidelines%2F4kjju3FUa9oQWzXhTgj4PK%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=US", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=US", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Ffood-dining%2F2019%2F04%2F02%2Fexperts-reviewing-low-carb-other-diets-for-guidelines%2F4kjju3FUa9oQWzXhTgj4PK%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tUS"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "deb lindsey", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "candice choi associat", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "atkins nutritionals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nina teicholz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "washington post cheese", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mediterranean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T03:51:43.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4dd935507cc70b688b9cd73ac7536a6053b407a7", "url": "https://big979.iheart.com/content/2019-04-02-what-should-we-ask-garth-brooks-when-he-joins-us-thursday/", "site_full": "big979.iheart.com", "site": "iheart.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["music", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "What Should We Ask Garth Brooks When He Joins Us Thursday? | Y96.9", "title_full": "What Should We Ask Garth Brooks When He Joins Us Thursday? | Y96.9", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5ca3e26a987ab4f64c508f43", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1524, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 121, "comments": 35, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4dd935507cc70b688b9cd73ac7536a6053b407a7", "url": "https://big979.iheart.com/content/2019-04-02-what-should-we-ask-garth-brooks-when-he-joins-us-thursday/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "What Should We Ask Garth Brooks When He Joins Us Thursday? | Y96.9", "text": "What Should We Ask Garth Brooks When He Joins Us Thursday?

But whether it's been Zoe's past trauma, Kevin's battle with alcoholism, or even the small but essential conversations that come with navigating an interracial relationship, they've managed to stick together throughout all of it. That could soon change, though \u2014 their latest hiccup isn't something they need to overcome as a team, but instead a fundamental disagreement about how their relationship should move forward. Kevin and Zoe's conversation about kids , which was teased in the trailer for the season finale, might spell disaster for both of them.\nAs she revealed last week, Zoe does not want children. She's always known she doesn't want to be a mother \u2014 she enjoys the freedom her life offers, and the ability to travel the world at a moment's notice with no one in mind but herself. This isn't something Zoe is going to change her feelings about, she says, and she urges Kevin to take some time and figure out if that's going to be OK with him.\nKevin, on the other hand, has always thought of children as some kind of inevitability \u2014 obviously he'd have them, and have a family like the one he grew up in. When he learns about Zoe's standpoint, he hesitates, but quickly says this won't be a dealbreaker. And yet, in the trailer for this week's episode , he's shown saying that sometimes people think they know what they want, and then sometimes things change. Giphy\nTrying to change someone's mind about having children is never a good idea. Couples have to make compromises all the time about where to live and which career opportunities to pursue, but becoming a parent is one thing that no one should give up on, or take part in, if they're not absolutely on board.\nIf Kevin tells Zoe he's OK with not having kids if it means they get to be together, but then starts to drop hints about how she might change her mind, that's completely unfair. Zoe was extremely straight up and mature in the way that she let Kevin know this was her decision, and she was willing to let him off the hook with no hard feelings if he wasn't willing to make that compromise. He said it would be alright, and that shouldn't come with any strings attached. But if he plans on trying to subtly chip away at her determination to be child-free, it is not going to end well for anybody.\nAnd of course, if Kevin wants kids, he shouldn't have to go without them. He absolutely has the right to move on without Zoe \u2014 she can't ask him to give up such a big part of his future, either. Ron Batzdorff/NBC\nBut the difference between the two of them seems to be that Zoe has made peace with her decision and its potential ramifications in her relationship. She's willing to let Kevin go if it doesn't fit into his plan; it'd be heartbreaking, but it'd be the right thing to do. She's not pretending to be OK with having kids for him, and going on to pepper in little passive comments about how she'd really rather not. Kevin seems to be channeling the idea that even if they fundamentally disagree on something this big, it can be fixed, or that he can convince her of all she'd supposedly be missing as a mother.\nIt's downright exhausting for people, particularly women , who are child-free, to be told that their opinion will change somewhere down the line. Zoe is an adult who is well aware of the harsh realities of life \u2014 she doesn't need to grow out of any phase or come into some epiphanic realization. Not every woman's purpose is to be a mother, and it's time we normalize that thought.\nIf Kevin comes to a well-thought out decision that being with Zoe is more important to him than being a father, that's great \u2014 I hope they live happily ever after with no regrets, I really do. But this teaser suggests he's only flimsily on board, and that's not fair to anyone involved.

All rights reserved.\nThe first episode of Don\u2019t Trust the B In Apartment 23 features the kind of opening you don't often see on network TV: titular b Chloe (Krysten Ritter) \u2014 a high-cheekboned, raven-haired sorority girl from hell \u2014 is screwing her roommate June\u2019s fiance, on top of June's birthday cake. They writhe. They moan. He drizzles champagne on her cleavage. Then, June walks in \u2014 which, we later find out, was all part of Chloe\u2019s plan. Now that he's been revealed as a cheater, June can finally dump him and move on with her life.\nIt\u2019s the kind of perversely logical, absurdly vulgar, and surprisingly tenderhearted moment that only Nahnatchka Khan , creator of TV comedies Don't Trust the B and Fresh Off the Boat , would be able to write. \u201cI had the idea of writing this unapologetic woman, and I wanted to challenge myself with something like: how do you start with something irredeemable and then come back from it?,\u201d Khan tells Bustle in a recent phone interview. \u201cThen the challenge becomes, how did she get there and why is she doing it?\u201d\nKhan is perhaps best known for her work on the groundbreaking, critically acclaimed Fresh Off the Boat . But she first made her mark with Don\u2019t Trust the B , the outrageously funny, criminally underappreciated ABC sitcom that aired from 2012 to 2013. In another universe, Don\u2019t Trust the B would probably have only been remembered as the show that launched the careers of Ritter and comedian Eric Andre. But thanks to streaming platforms like Hulu, Don\u2019t Trust the B has developed a cult following since its cancellation, with websites like The Cut and Mashable offering gushing homages to the show\u2019s rapid-fire comic patter, absurdist yet oddly relatable portrait of female friendship, and Ritter\u2019s uninhibited performance as TV's most lovable female sociopath since Elaine from Seinfeld . Krysten Ritter as \"Don't Trust the B in Apartment 23\"'s Chloe. Photo credit: ABC\nAnd it\u2019s the clarity of Khan\u2019s vision \u2014 and her insistence that the show, however weird, bawdy and offbeat it was, would one day find an audience \u2014 that is largely to thank for that. \u201cFor so long on TV, women had to apologize or have to make excuses for their behavior or other people\u2019s behavior.\"\nAfter attending USC\u2019s School of Cinema-Television and working for several years working as a writer and producer on other sitcoms (including beloved '90s proto-feminist cartoon Pepper Ann ) , Khan had the seedling for the idea for Don\u2019t Trust the B \u2014 which, surprisingly, was rooted in the classic film Breakfast at Tiffany's . \u201cI wondered what it would look like if [Holly Golightly, Breakfast 's heroine ] lived today in the modern era,\" says Khan, \"and you paired her with a roommate who was regular and paid bills and, like, went to Chipotle.\"\nIn certain respects, 2012 was the perfect time for Don\u2019t Trust the B to enter the world: Bridesmaids had debuted the year before, breaking box office records and ushering in a wave of thinkpieces heralding the rise of women behaving badly . \u201cSeeing how flawed, strong women could be the center of stories was coming up in the zeitgeist,\u201d Khan says.\nPrior to that, it was rare to see a female character as unabashedly flawed as Chloe on television. \u201cFor so long on TV, women had to apologize or have to make excuses for their behavior or other people\u2019s behavior. They were usually the nagging wife or girlfriend,\u201d Khan said. For her, writing Don\u2019t Trust the B was about presenting that part of herself \u201cthat was all about being an unapologetic woman. Like, \u2018I\u2019m just gonna do what I want.\u2019\u201d Khan with cast and producers of \"Don't Trust the B. Photo credit: ABC/Rick Rowell. \u00a9 2012 American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\"[Chloe] doesn\u2019t care about doing the right thing and doesn\u2019t have that pull to society,\u201d says Khan, because, well, it's funnier that way. She wrote Chloe as a character with \u201cthe narrowest thread to humanity\u201d as a way to up the comedic stakes. Chloe's actions, says Khan, are loosely inspired by the kind of stuff you might bring up during \u201cridiculous fantasy drunken talk with your friends\" \u2014 except Chloe actually does it. \"I would rather go out completely confident in what we were doing creatively rather than turn the show around to get the ratings up.\u201d\nKhan pitched the show to Fox, which liked the idea but passed; she then brought it to ABC, which at the time had a mandate to develop strong female voices. A casting director suggested Khan check out Ritter, based on her performance as doomed artist/ landlord Jane Margolis on prestige drama Breaking Bad . Khan was initially skeptical, but after the two met and discussed the character, she knew she was \u201cperfect.\u201d\nBut while critics had been happy to embrace Bridesmaids as a sign of a new era of unashamed women in comedy, many critics were confused by Don\u2019t Trust the B when it initially premiered on ABC in 2012. The New York Times \u2019 Jon Caramanica wrote that the show relied on shock value rather than genuine laughs and that \u201cthere\u2019s less heart here than in the relationship that is at the core of \u20182 Broke Girls.\u2019\u201d The show also had to compete with the glut of other new entries to the \u201cgirls behaving badly\u201d canon, from the critically venerated ( Girls , The Mindy Project ) to the, uh, less so ( 2 Broke Girls , Whitney , Are You There, Chelsea? ) \u2014 all of which premiered within a few months of Don't Trust the B 's debut.\nThe show's ratings were poor . But Khan says she never felt pressure to try to change the voice of Don\u2019t Trust the B to appeal to network executives, nor did she ever consider doing so. \u201cInternally, you kind of start to scramble. You start to think, \u2018Should I sand the edges off? Should I make her more likable?,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cYou have that thought for a second. But then you\u2019re like, \u2018No. I wouldn\u2019t be happy with that.\u2019\"\nWhen Don't Trust the B was canceled in 2013, it was not a surprise for Khan, who had written a season finale (Chloe\u2019s quest to become head \u201cfoot ho\u201d on a BET-esque dance show) with the expectation that it would also be the series finale. \"I would rather go out completely confident in what we were doing creatively,\" says Khan, \"rather than turn the show around to get the ratings up.\u201d Khan on set at \"Don't Trust the B\" with James Van Der Beek. Photo credit: ABC/Nicole Rivelli\nAfter Don\u2019t Trust the B was cancelled, Khan went through a mourning period, during which she says \u201cI got drunk for like three months. Then I was like, \u2018OK, I gotta do something else.\u2019\u201d She started working on two pilots, one of which was Fresh Off the Boat . At the time, Khan\u2019s only guiding force for a new project was to do something completely different from Don\u2019t Trust the B , and the adaptation of chef Eddie Huang\u2019s memoir fit the bill: as the daughter of Iranian immigrants, \u201cit spoke to another element of my personality and my life. I was like, \u2018Oh, I know this story. I can tell these stories,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI got a place at the table, and I\u2019m excited to tell the stories I wanna tell, which are the stories I wanna see.\u201d\nWhen ABC first expressed interest in picking up Fresh , Khan was wary: after all, this was the network that had canceled her baby. \u201cI told [network executives] I didn\u2019t want to be like their Charlie Brown and Lucy with the football, like they keep taking it and moving it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was definitely a leap of faith for me.\u201d\nBut the leap paid off: the show was widely acclaimed , with many heralding the show\u2019s primarily Asian-American cast (the first on network TV since Margaret Cho\u2019s 1994 sitcom All-American Girl ) as a boon for representation. \u201cI knew [ Fresh Off The Boat ] spoke to people in a different way [than Don't Trust the B did],\u201d Khan said. \u201cFOTB spoke to a lot of people in terms of how they saw themselves in it. Very few people saw themselves in Chloe or June or James Van der Beek. It\u2019s kind of a different access point.\u201d Khan celebrates the 100th episode of \"Fresh Off the Boat\" with cast, crew, producers, and network executives Photo credit: ABC/Eric McCandless. \u00a9 2019 American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.\nIt was also a question of cultural change. Since Fresh Off the Boat premiered in 2014 (it\u2019s now in its fifth season), the explosive success of films like Crazy Rich Asians and Black Panther have definitively proven the hunger among mainstream audiences for realistic, emotional stories about people of color. This was especially exciting for Khan, who came up as a queer woman of color during a time when comedy was largely dominated by straight white male gatekeepers. \u201cWhen you\u2019re none of those things, and you\u2019re running zero for three, your expectations are low, but also so is your fear,\u201d she says. And this lack of fear has ultimately enabled her to take more creative risks: \u201cI got a place at the table, and I\u2019m excited to tell the stories I wanna tell, which are the stories I wanna see.\u201d\nThis year, Khan will continue to tell these stories with her directorial debut, Always Be My Maybe , a Netflix romantic comedy starring Ali Wong and FOTB\u2019s Randall Park. But even though Fresh Off the Boat has created a new world of storytelling opportunities for Khan, the weird little underappreciated sitcom that launched her career has always lingered in the back of her mind \u2014 particularly as Don't Trust the B has garnered an entirely new fan base who discovered the show on Hulu and Netflix.\nKhan still regularly gets ideas for Don't Trust the B cold opens or plotlines (one would involve Chloe playing a role in every major scandal over the past seven or eight years, from LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling\u2019s leaked racist comments to the release of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails). And she sees its influence on TV shows from Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt to Killing Eve . \u201c[ Killing Eve \u2019s Villanelle is] a queer bored millennial assassin sociopath,\u201d Khan says. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018That could be Chloe\u2019s daughter. I get it.\u2019\u201d\nAnd just as canceled-before-their-time shows like Deadwood and Arrested Development have been resuscitated, Khan says that\u2019s not outside the realm of possibility for Don\u2019t Trust the B. The show, she notes, could return in some form, like a handful of special episodes on a streaming platform or even a Christmas movie. \u201cI know Dreama [Walker, who played June] would love it, and James [Van Der Beek, who played James Van Der Beek] would love it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe still have a bunch of stories we want to tell.\u201d (Ritter also said she\u2019d be game for a DTTB revival during an appearance on a Comicapalooza panel last year.) Krysten Ritter and Dreama Walker on \"Don't Trust the B.\" Photo credit: ABC\nToday, Khan chalks up the failure of Don't Trust the B to poor timing: had streaming platforms, which tend to rely less on ratings systems and give shows more time to grow, been widely available at the time, she\u2019s confident the show would have found its audience. And she's right. Her initial vision of a woman fucking up and refusing to apologize for it has found an audience \u2014 just a few years later than she initially expected.\n\u201cI was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know about the overnight Nielsen audience, but I know that people will find this show and love it and watch it.\u2019 That was something I was telling everybody\u2026.so [its newfound success] does make me feel satisfied,\" she says. \u201cI was always adamant that there\u2019s an audience for this.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nahnatchka khan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ej dickson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "abc/rick rowell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "krysten ritter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chloe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "american broadcasting companies, inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T04:19:16.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0bb547faa44b5c3d3397ef93919158db6447c367", "url": "https://in.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-shares-mixed-at-close-of-trade-dow-jones-industrial-average-down-030-1518769", "site_full": "in.investing.com", "site": "investing.com", "site_section": "https://in.investing.com/news/latest-news", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Latest Financial News - Investing.com India", "title": "U.S. shares mixed at close of trade; Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.30% By Investing.com", "title_full": "U.S. shares mixed at close of trade; Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.30% By Investing.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB110XX_L.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 699, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0bb547faa44b5c3d3397ef93919158db6447c367", "url": "https://in.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-shares-mixed-at-close-of-trade-dow-jones-industrial-average-down-030-1518769", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Investing.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "U.S. shares mixed at close of trade; Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.30% By Investing.com", "text": "\u00a9 Reuters.

In the event the world's two largest economies are unable to reach a trade deal soon, some analysts have warned that a global recession could follow .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mark schiefelbein", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "steven mnuchin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "myron brilliant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert lighthizer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "us treasury", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "financial times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. chamber of commerce", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diaoyutai state guesthouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T04:26:22.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d098ca3548b45f4978c498cb804f04284712aeb", "url": "https://catcountry1071.iheart.com/featured/amy-lynn/content/2019-04-02-the-us-open-tennis-tourney-april-fools-prank-everyone-wants/", "site_full": "catcountry1071.iheart.com", "site": "iheart.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "The US Open Tennis Tourney \"April Fool's Prank\" Everyone WANTS! | Amy Lynn | Cat Country 107.1", "title_full": "The US Open Tennis Tourney \"April Fool's Prank\" Everyone WANTS! | Amy Lynn | Cat Country 107.1", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.479, "main_image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5ca3be278243d2fd8d51edd1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1524, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5d098ca3548b45f4978c498cb804f04284712aeb", "url": "https://catcountry1071.iheart.com/featured/amy-lynn/content/2019-04-02-the-us-open-tennis-tourney-april-fools-prank-everyone-wants/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The US Open Tennis Tourney \"April Fool's Prank\" Everyone WANTS! | Amy Lynn | Cat Country 107.1", "text": "The US Open Tennis Tourney \"April Fool's Prank\" Everyone WANTS!

Competitor CVS followed it lower.\nAdvertisement The S&P 500 ended essentially flat, having eked out a sliver of a gain, which was still good enough to extend the benchmark index\u2019s winning streak into a fourth day. Small-company stocks fell.\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning. \u2018\u2018You had some selling this morning, but it didn\u2019t really materialize into much of anything,\u2019\u2019 said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. \u2018\u2018There will be plenty of market-moving things over the next few weeks.\u2019\u2019\nAll told, the S&P 500 index edged up 0.05 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 2,867.24.\nThe Dow Jones average fell 79.29 points, or 0.3 percent, to 26,179.13. The Nasdaq rose 19.78 points, or 0.3 percent, to 7,848.69. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks gave up 2.74 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,553.32.\nMajor European stock indexes finished higher.\nAdvertisement Bond prices rose. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell to 2.47 percent from 2.49 percent late Monday.\nThe day\u2019s downbeat finish for stocks followed an overall strong stretch for the market.\nThe S&P 500 finished the January-March period with its biggest quarterly gain in nearly a decade. The index is now up 14.4 percent this year, and would need to rise just 2.2 percent to regain the peak it reached Sept. 20.\nInvestors are still not sure which direction to move as they weigh uncertainty over international trade issues and warnings about a weak first quarter for companies.\nThe unresolved US-China trade dispute is still a key issue, said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. \u2018\u2018Nobody wants to buy with both hands, just in case,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018But, people won\u2019t aggressively sell everything as well, just in case.\u2019\u2019\nAdvertisement Traders are looking ahead to Wednesday, when trade negotiations are due to resume. Officials from the world\u2019s two biggest economies are aiming to put to rest a dispute over technology and other issues.\nFriday also brings potential market-moving news, when the government issues its tally of jobs added by US employers last month. Economists project a gain of 170,000, according to FactSet.\nInvestors are also gearing up for a slew of corporate earnings this month.\nWall Street expects a contraction in earnings during the first quarter, followed by slow growth for the remainder of 2019. Any company commentary about prospects for the next few quarters will be important in giving analysts and investors a better picture of the economy.\nThe technology, communication, and real estate sectors were among those that squeezed out gains Monday. Apple rose 1.5 percent, Facebook gained 3.3 percent, and Boston Properties added 1.6 percent.\nWalgreens led a slide in consumer products stocks after it reported a 14 percent drop in second-quarter profit. The company also slashed its forecast for 2019. Walgreens shares fell 12.8 percent and helped push down competitor CVS Health by 3.8 percent.\nAirline stocks rose after Delta Air Lines raised its profit forecast for the current quarter. Delta jumped 6 percent. United Continental picked up 2.3 percent, American Airlines Group added 2 percent, and JetBlue Airways rose 1.2 percent.\nDow Inc., which makes plastics and other products for consumer and industrial uses, climbed 5.1 percent in its first day of trading after being spun off from the chemical maker DowDuPont.\nBenchmark US crude gained 1.6 percent to settle at $62.58 a barrel. Brent crude, used to price international oils, closed 0.5 percent higher at $69.37.\nLoading comments...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fbusiness%2F2019%2F04%2F02%2Fstock-indexes-end-day-mixed%2FwuI2gzzHnnyl4HCzjCywpK%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tUS", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fbusiness%2F2019%2F04%2F02%2Fstock-indexes-end-day-mixed%2FwuI2gzzHnnyl4HCzjCywpK%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=US", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=US", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fbusiness%2F2019%2F04%2F02%2Fstock-indexes-end-day-mixed%2FwuI2gzzHnnyl4HCzjCywpK%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=US", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fbusiness%2F2019%2F04%2F02%2Fstock-indexes-end-day-mixed%2FwuI2gzzHnnyl4HCzjCywpK%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "willie delwiche", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cvs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walgreens boots alliance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baird", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T04:47:51.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ebd5277c6e43b6a72a5a1843292c898d399d2863", "url": "https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/04/02/world-trade-forecasts-slashed-again-amid-us-china-standoff.html", "site_full": "www.thestar.com", "site": "thestar.com", "site_section": "http://www.thestar.com/feeds.articles.business.rss", "site_categories": ["media", "hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "TORONTO STAR", "title": "World trade forecasts slashed again amid US-China standoff", "title_full": "World trade forecasts slashed again amid US-China standoff | The Star", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.thestar.com/assets/img/thestar-ribbon.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3654, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ebd5277c6e43b6a72a5a1843292c898d399d2863", "url": "https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/04/02/world-trade-forecasts-slashed-again-amid-us-china-standoff.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jamey Keaten", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "World trade forecasts slashed again amid US-China standoff", "text": " World trade forecasts slashed again amid US-China standoff By Jamey Keaten The Associated Press GENEVA\u2014The World Trade Organization has cut its forecast for trade growth this year by more than a percentage point, to 2.6 per cent, due to an economic slowdown and amid a trade conflict between the United States and China.\nThe downgrade \u2014 from 3.7 per cent forecast issued in September \u2014 reflects how quickly the prospects for global business are fading as, among other things, the U.S. and China struggle to agree on how to lift tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars-worth of trade.\n\u201cRising trade tensions are the major factor,\u201d WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo told The Associated Press on Tuesday after the release of the forecasts.\nBeyond the trade war, the WTO has cited weaker economic growth in North America, Europe and Asia \u2014 largely as the effect of fiscal stimulus by the Trump administration wears off. It noted a \u201cphaseout\u201d of monetary stimulus in Europe and China\u2019s efforts to shift its economy away from its traditional reliance on manufacturing and investment toward services and consumption.\nIn 2018, trade grew by just 3 per cent \u2014 far below the WTO\u2019s forecast for 3.9 per cent, which had itself been downgraded last year. And next year, the Geneva-based trade body expects only a small uptick in trade growth by volume next year, to 3 per cent.\n \u201cThere is potential for a slight improvement in 2020 but that is very much dependent on an easing of the trade tensions,\u201d he said.\nThe WTO oversees international trade rules and settles disputes between countries. The Trump administration has also been critical of the WTO, accusing it of being \u201cunfair\u201d with the United States.\nThe U.S. has slowly squeezed the WTO by blocking appointments to its dispute settlement group, the Appellate Body, which could in December fall below the minimum number of members required.\nAzevedo pointed to the \u201cfundamental importance of the rules-based trading system,\u201d saying that its weakening would \u201cbe a historic mistake with repercussions for jobs, growth and stability around the world.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jamey keaten", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "roberto azevedo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world trade organization", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T05:08:33.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3298b25302e4c50c4a897b1f6ea4880859ec0321", "url": "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190402006032/en/", "site_full": "www.businesswire.com", "site": "businesswire.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["jewelry_making", "media", "hobbies_and_interests", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "", "title": "Akebia Therapeutics Reports Inducement Grants Under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4) | Business & Finance | heraldchronicle.com", "title_full": "Akebia Therapeutics Reports Inducement Grants Under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4) | Business & Finance | heraldchronicle.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/heraldchronicle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/52a8442c-ad3e-11e8-9945-9bec6b675371.jpg?resize=600%2C386", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5013, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3298b25302e4c50c4a897b1f6ea4880859ec0321", "url": "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190402006032/en/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Akebia Therapeutics Reports Inducement Grants Under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4) | Business & Finance | heraldchronicle.com", "text": "Akebia Therapeutics Reports Inducement Grants Under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4) 6 hrs ago Save\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr 2, 2019-- Akebia Therapeutics , Inc.

The pair is flirting with the 1.12 important support for the first time in nearly a month, and a break below this level could open the way towards 2019 lows around 1.1175.\nPoor inflation figures in the euro area confirmed the slowdown in the region, which suggests the ECB won\u2019t dare to start hiking rates in the medium term. In the short term, signs of waning risk-on sentiment after strong Chinese data add to the negative pressure on the euro.\nMeanwhile, dollar demand persists, motivating the pair to decline further.\nIn the longer-term, political risks will rise for the single currency in light of the upcoming parliamentary elections in the EU, with the potential increase of the populist power could hurt the euro and drive the pair substantially lower.

against the EUR, in line with our expectations, , as investors evaluated international growth prospects with the U.S. and European central banks unlikely to raise interest rates soon.\nFactories in the euro zone had their worst month for almost six years in March and forward looking indicators pointed to gloomy times ahead, a survey found, grim reading for European Central Bank policymakers.\nManufacturing PMI declined for an eighth month, coming in at 47.5 from February's 49.3, just below a flash estimate and its lowest reading since April 2013.\nAn index measuring output change, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday - seen as a good gauge of economic health - sank to 47.2 from 49.4, its lowest since April 2013 and the second straight month it has come in below the 50 level dividing growth from contraction.\nThe disappointing results come after the ECB changed its outlook last month. It pushed back the timing of an interest rate rise until 2020 at the earliest and said it would offer banks a new round of cheap loans to help revive the economy.\nData on Tuesday, however, showed that new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in February and shipments were unchanged, while data for January was revised slightly higher.\nOur economic cycle clock suggest the U.S. economy entered the recession phase in recent months. Economic Cycle Clock\nEUR/USD has registered multiple daily closes below the 1.1241 Fibonacci level, a 76.4% retrace of the 1.1177 to 1.1448 rise. That has made the chance of a breakdown below the recent 1.1177 2019 low more likely.

The divestiture is in tandem with this new strategy.\nIn fact, in its latest effort to consolidate the Nordic capital market by bringing the Norwegian financial ecosystem together with the Danish, Finish, Icelandic and Swedish systems, the Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold) provider of trading and clearing services is looking to acquire Oslo B\u00f8rs VPS Holding ASA.\nEarlier, Nasdaq's divestiture of 5% equity stake in LCH Group Holdings Limited reflected the company's endeavor to free up capital from non-core areas to deploy the same in growth initiatives.\nSAI Global is a recognized global provider of integrated risk management (IRM) software and the world's leading provider of ethics and compliance learning content. Thus, the addition of BWise to SAI Global's portfolio will add capabilities to the acquirer's suite of integrated risk management skills, thereby strengthening its market presence.\nShares of Nasdaq have outperformed the industry year to date. While the company's shares have gained 8.4%, the industry decreased 4.3%. The company's sustained efforts to expand capabilities and accelerate growth should continue to keep the momentum alive.\nStocks to Consider\nSome better-ranked stocks from the finance sector are Arch Capital Group Ltd.

(AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa, File) SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) \u2014 Government officials, aid workers and activists in Central America are mystified by U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to cut off nearly $500 million in aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador in response to what he calls an immigration crisis. Over time, they say, it will only worsen the problem. At risk of falling on the chopping block are development programs that work to tackle the root causes driving migration: poverty, inequality, violence and corruption. These include outreach to at-risk youth to combat forced gang recruitment as well as programs to address gender-based violence and support education, workforce development and the uphill fight to root out endemic graft. \"It's illogical and it's irresponsible. ... You're talking about long-term challenges that are going to require long-term, sustainable solutions,\" said Adriana Beltr\u00e1n, a Central America specialist at the Washington Office on Latin America. \"So rather than helping to stabilize the situation and try to address these long-term challenges, the cut in assistance will only make the situation worse.\" \"Gutting important programs,\" she added, \"will eventually lead to more migration, more insecurity, more corruption, more impunity in these countries.\" It's still not clear exactly what, when or how much could be cut. Trump said last week that \"we were paying them tremendous amounts of money and we're not paying them anymore because they haven't done a thing for us,\" and mentioned a figure of $500 million. State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said Tuesday that the amount affected by any aid cut would be $450 million from fiscal year 2018 as well as an as yet undetermined amount from 2017. \"The president has made clear that the decision is aimed at securing the United States borders and protecting American citizens,\" Palladino said. \"These programs have not effectively prevented illegal immigration from coming to the United States, and they've not achieved the desired results.\" The aid is meant to promote democracy-building, good governance, trade, agriculture, education, health, public safety and law enforcement. Experts say all of those areas play a direct role in whether people feel they can get by or even survive in their home countries. Reaction from the three governments has been muted so far, perhaps for fear of angering Trump. Both Honduras and El Salvador pointedly said they had not been formally notified of any specific cuts in U.S. aid. Honduran Defense Minister Fredy D\u00edaz said cooperation with the United States on security is \"unchanged,\" while the Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the relationship has been \"solid, close and positive.\" Salvadoran Vice President Oscar Ortiz said Tuesday that an aid cut would not solve the migration problem but have the opposite effect. \"The best way to tackle the issue of migration ... is not with this type of decision,\" he said. \"The best way to tackle the issue is to keep working together.\" Guatemala, the source of much of the recent migration from the region, was particularly circumspect, with presidential spokesman Alfredo Brito saying simply that the official response was not to comment for the time being. But those carrying out the boots-on-the-ground work are concerned. Rick Jones, who works in El Salvador as the youth and migration policy adviser for Catholic Relief Services, counsels young people to keep them out of gangs and help them get jobs. He also runs behavioral therapy for inmates to deter them from returning to crime \u2014 all things that have \"a positive impact to help guys think about and change their behavior,\" he said. It's seen as unglamorous but badly needed work, especially in a place like El Salvador, which has a homicide rate that is among the world's highest at more than 50 per 100,000 people last year. But all $38 million that Catholic Relief Services gets from U.S. government agencies to run programs in the three countries \u2014 including ones on education and jobs \u2014 could disappear if the cutoff goes through. If that happens, \"it will be sending the message, 'Help is not on the way ... and you're going to be left on your own,'\" Jones said. \"And basically people left on their own are going to be more desperate and more people are going to leave.\" Likewise, Vicki Gass, Oxfam America senior policy adviser for Central America and Mexico, said that axing funding for programs that have been running for years, would, in many cases, \"waste U.S. taxpayer dollars that have already been invested\" and \"foster the same instability that is making people flee in the first place.\" Some government programs aimed at persuading Central Americans not to emigrate have been put in place, in part in response to Trump's earlier criticism about the migrant caravans that brought thousands trekking toward the U.S. border, and the threatened aid cutoff does not take that into account, officials say. \"This goes against what we have seen in reports that show there have really been some decreases in migration, and that they are the result of the efforts being made on this issue,\" said lawmaker Yanci Urbina of the left-leaning FMLN party in El Salvador, the least populated of the three countries and a distant third in terms of how many migrants are heading for the U.S. Salvadoran Treasury Minister Nelson Fuentes said U.S. aid in his country includes $20 million in technical and fiscal funding over five years, and the government has not gotten word of any cuts. Another $200 million to spur growth and employment is managed in tandem with the World Bank, and it remains to be seen whether this will be reduced. Finally there are direct donations from Washington to the Salvadoran government and private organizations. Fuentes said aid for security and migration could be affected, but that actively funded contracts should not be. In Guatemala, the most significant aid comes in security assistance to fight drug trafficking \u2014 and that has already come under scrutiny recently over questionable use of armored vehicles donated by Washington. Other funds through USAID go to help programs on things like agriculture and education in poor rural communities, plus training for prosecutors, who have waged a high-profile fight against corruption in recent years, or for judges. Honduran political analyst Omar Garc\u00eda called U.S. aid to his country \"vital\" and said the threatened cuts show that Washington is \"an unreliable ally for Honduras.\" Like Guatemala, Honduras has backed the Trump administration on key issues such as recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and on the political crisis in Venezuela. It remains to be seen whether such support could waver. \"A sense of nationalism is surging in this country ... and that could be a good thing,\" Garc\u00eda said. Beltr\u00e1n noted that most of the assistance now in jeopardy does not go directly to the three countries' governments but to agencies, NGOs, church groups and others. She predicted that an attempt to cut aid could face pushback in Congress if funds are reprogrammed without lawmakers' consent. Particularly in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, members and committees could try to place holds on money in the next funding bill, she said. \"It is going to ensue into a battle,\" Beltr\u00e1n said, \"because it is Congress that at the end of the day has the power of the purse.\" ___ Associated Press writers Sonia Perez D. in Guatemala City, Freddy Cuevas in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, Matthew Lee in Washington and Mark Stevenson and Peter Orsi in Mexico City contributed to this report. ___ This story has been corrected to fix misattributed quotes which came from Honduran political analyst Omar Garc\u00eda.

He also ordered the closure of Venezuela's border with Brazil \"until further notice\" amid a tense standoff with the US-backed Opposition leader, Juan Guaido, over allowing in humanitarian aid.\nThe South American nation is crippled with a political and economic crisis since January after Guaido proclaimed himself as the President of the nation in January. While most European countries have recognised Guaido as the interim President, countries like Russia, China, Turkey, amongst others, have slammed foreign interference in Venezuela and shown support for Maduro.

Using a computer to limit a person's housing choices can be just as discriminatory as slamming a door in someone's face,\" HUD Secretary Ben Carson said in a statement.\nAccording to a report in The Verge, the charges were based on a complaint filed in August.\nThe department accused Facebook of allowing advertisers to exclude certain people from seeing ads, including parents, people born outside the US, non-Christians and those interested in Hispanic culture or accessibility matters.\nA Facebook representative was quoted as saying they were surprised by HUD's decision. \"We've been working with them to address the concerns and have taken significant steps to prevent ads discrimination,\" the spokesperson told The Verge.\nIn a blog post on March 19, Facebook announced new changes where anyone who wants to run such ads will no longer be allowed to target by age, gender or zip code.\nThese changes were the result of settlement agreements with leading civil rights organisations and ongoing input from civil rights experts, said Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg.\nLast year, the US National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA), the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Communication Workers of America (CWA) and other private parties, filed litigation against Facebook, saying it needs to build stronger protections against abuse.\n\"Our policies prohibit advertisers from using our tools to discriminate.

So far, the moves to impose sanctions against Azhar were initiated in the UN Security Council Al Qaeda sanctions committee, where the proceedings are held in secret.\nChina has announced its opposition to the US effort, which it said bypasses the Sanctions Committee and goes directly to the Council.\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said in Beijing: \"This is not in line with the resolution of the issue through dialogue and negotiations\".\n\"We urge the US to act cautiously and avoid forcefully moving forward this resolution draft,\" he added.\nA date has not been set for taking up the resolution by the Council. France is the President of the Council this month and Germany will take over next month.\nThe latest attempt to impose sanctions on Azhar that would have banned his international travel and frozen his assets were vetoed this month by China in the sanctions committee - the fourth such action.\nWith global revulsion against terrorism rising after the Pulwama attack in February, the Security Council adopted a press statement condemning it in \"strongest\" terms. It was a statement arrived at by consensus in the 15-member Council and did not have the force of resolution, and Beijing went along avoiding having to vote for it or veto it.\nThe statement, which mentioned the JeM but not Azhar, said: \"The members of the Security Council reiterated that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed.\"\nBefore the Al Qaeda sanctions committee took up Azahar's case this month, the US said that China's opposition would run counter to the mutual goal with the US of regional stability.\nAzhar \"meets the criteria for designation by the United Nations\" as a global terrorist subject to its sanctions, Department Deputy Spokesperson Robert Palladino said.\n\"The United States and China share a mutual interest in achieving regional stability and peace, and that a failure to designate Azhar would run counter to this goal\", he added.\n( Arul Louis can be reached at arul.l@ians.in and followed on Twitter @arulouis)\n--IANS\nal/vd (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

He understands the needs of the players in the dressing room,\" Amrinder was quoted as saying by the official website of the All India Football Federation (AIFF).\n\"It's very easy to communicate with him on the pitch, so we have a good understanding and can thwart attacks easily,\" he added.\nWhen asked how did a Romanian fit seamlessly into a back-four comprising three Indian defenders, Amrinder pointed at Goian's massive interest in Indian culture and languages, which helped the defenders communicate amongst each other.\n\"He is so much invested in Indian culture now that he has started to pick up the language quite often. That helps a lot when we are in clutch situations on the pitch,\" said Amrinder.\n\"He hangs out with me a lot off the field. So he has picked the Punjabi language through songs. It was a huge surprise for me when I first heard him singing along to a Punjabi song,\" he added.\nIt is not just Punjabi that the Romanian has picked. Videos of Goian singing the \"Jana Gana Mana\" have gone viral this season.\n\"At the end of last season, Goian promised me that he would sing the Indian national anthem on the pitch one day, and he did it,\" Amrinder said, adding: \"It didn't take him long. He kept his promise.\"\nThe goalkeeper also praised the contribution of the three Indian defenders -- Anwar Ali (Sr), Subhasish Bose and Souvik Chakraborty -- who played a big role along with the Romanian.\nComing on the back of a good season in the ISL, Amrinder believes that the Islanders are \"hungry\" for success in the Hero Super Cup. He believes that the experience of head coach Jorge Costa, who had played for top European clubs like FC Porto, Charlton Athletic and Standard Liege, will bail them through.\n\"Our team has improved a lot after coach Jorge Costa took over at the start of the season. He was a big player back during his playing days. He also has the experience of playing and managing big games like in the UEFA Champions League.

It's designed for consequence to Russia. \"\nThe 2017 law adopted with bi-partisan support as a response to Moscow's involvement in US elections seeks to impose sanctions on buyers of Russian defence equipment.\nSchriver was answering a question form Democratic Representative Seth Moulton, who asked how India's purchase of S-400 and the lease of Russian nuclear submarines would impact India-US relations.\nSchriver told him that the purchase of S-400 has \"not gone to contract or completed\", but he did not touch on the $3 billion lease agreement India signed earlier this month for a Russian Akula class nuclear submarine.\nPossible US alternatives to the Russian S-400 are the Lockheed Martin's THAAD system (short for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) and Raytheon's Patriot system, although the three vary in capabilities and costs.\nChina's challenge in the Indo-Pacific region and the US response to it dominated the hearings. \"The reemergence of great power competition - if not carefully managed - poses a challenge to the free and open order in the Indo-Pacific that underpins our continued peace and prosperity\" Schriver said.\nDavidson said that \"the vision of a-free and open Indo-Pacific\" was the unifying factor for India, Japan, Australia, France and New Zealand, which shared similar concepts.\nThe chair of the Armed Service Committee Adam Smith, a Democrat, and other legislators and US defence officials spoke of the importance of the growing ties between the two biggest democracies.\nSmith noted that the Pacific command had been renamed Indo-Pacific with India in mind. \"The improvement of our relationship with the nation of India is one of the most positive developments in foreign relations in last several years\", he said. \"I hope we can build and improve upon that\".\nConcurring with him, Schriver said it was \"a great example of a partnership that we're investing a lot in\". He said the first 2+2 high-level meeting of the defence and foreign affairs heads of the two countries in September made \"great strides in the defense relationship\".\nDavidson, called the signing of the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) a \"breakthrough down at the operational level\".\nIndia's Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and then-Defence Secretary James Mattis of the US met in New Delhi for the first 2+2 meeting to enhance strategic cooperation between their countries. COMCASA was signed at the meeting.\nRepresentative Mike Waltz, a Republican, asked, \"Moving forward. what more can we do in our engagement with India and what more should we be doing and what more would you like to do and how can this body help\"?\n\"We're working to operationalise the COMCASA\", Davidson said. \"It's an IT (Information Technology) Agreement (Through) which we can do sharing and other things\".\n\"There's an opportunity for us to share tactical fly away kits in an operational planning system that I think will advance our relationship on military to military relationship very, very well\" he said.\nHe said that India switching to US defence equipment would enhance interoperability and \"allows us to get to training doctrine, tactical level coordination that's really powerful\".\n\"While they very much want to protect their nonaligned policy, the tactical and technical capability we get out of like systems will really advance that relationship down in the military space\", he added.\nIn a written statement to the committee, Schriver said earlier, \"Within South Asia, we are pursuing emerging partnerships with Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, and the Maldives\".\n\"With India and Japan, the Malabar exercise affords an opportunity to increase our ability to operate trilaterally, including through real-time information sharing\", he said.\n( Arul Louis can be reached at arul.l@ians.in)\n--IANS\nal/vin/ (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

naturalisation fraud\nThree Indian-origin consultants in the US have been charged with substantive visa fraud for submitting sham applications for the popular H-1B visas to gain a competitive advantage over competing firms.\nA federal grand jury last month indicted Kishore Dattapuram, of Santa Clara, Kumar Aswapathi, of Austin, Texas, and Santosh Giri, of San Jose, on 10 counts of substantive visa fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud, the Department of Justice said in a statement.\nThe H-1B visa programme, popular among Indian technology professionals, allows foreign workers to obtain temporary authorisation to live and work for employers in the US.\nTo secure an H-1B visa, an employer or other sponsor must submit an 'I-129' petition to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.\nA petition and associated documentation must confirm the existence and duration of the job waiting for the worker, and describe key details including the wages associated with the position.\nAccording to the eight-page indictment, Dattapuram, 49, Aswapathi, 49, and Giri, 42 operated Nanosemantics, Inc, a Santa Clara-based consulting firm whose services included placing skilled foreign workers at software and technology companies in the Bay Area in California.\nThey worked together to submit fraudulent H-1B visa applications on behalf of foreign workers in order to gain a competitive advantage over competing firms.\nThe defendants allegedly used Nanosemantics to submit fraudulent I-129 petitions and obtain H-1B visas for workers that the defendants could later place at local companies.\nBy maintaining a group of available workers, the defendants would gain a competitive advantage over consultants that properly applied for paperwork only after matching a qualified worker to and available job.\nAccording to the indictment, several of the I-129 petitions submitted by defendants stated that particular workers had specific jobs waiting for them at designated companies when, in reality, the defendants knew that these jobs did not exist.\nFurther, the defendants allegedly sought the cooperation of third parties to conceal their fraud.\nFor example, defendants allegedly orchestrated payments by Nanosemantics to at least one individual for permission to list his company as the employer for foreign workers even though Nanosemantics actually intended to place the workers elsewhere.\nFurther, defendants allegedly coached foreign workers and others, to respond to government inquiries in a way that would prevent the government from discovering the fraud.\nThe defendants were charged with one count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud and ten counts of substantive visa fraud.\nThe defendants were arrested last week in their respective towns of residence.\nAll three defendants entered pleas of not guilty and were released on bonds. They are next scheduled to appear on May 13 for a status conference before Judge Edward J Davila, US District Judge.\nIf convicted, the defendants face a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of USD 250,000, plus restitution if appropriate for each violation.

Hemalkumar Shah, Sharvil Patel and Brenda Dozier are currently awaiting sentencing.\n\"We here at IRS CI recognise the heartache and concern these crooks cause innocent people. This is why we are eager to team up with our law enforcement partners to track down these impersonators in whatever corner of the globe they may be hiding in,\" said special agent in-charge Mary Hammond of IRS Criminal Investigations, Tampa Field Office.\nJ Russell George, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, said, \"Over the last several years, American taxpayers have been subjected to unprecedented attempts to fraudulently obtain money by individuals impersonating Internal Revenue Service employees.\" \"Victimising taxpayers by impersonating IRS employees is a serious crime,\" he said.

They worked together to submit fraudulent H-1B visa applications on behalf of foreign workers in order to gain a competitive advantage over competing firms.\nThe defendants allegedly used Nanosemantics to submit fraudulent I-129 petitions and obtain H-1B visas for workers that the defendants could later place at local companies.\nBy maintaining a group of available workers, the defendants would gain a competitive advantage over consultants that properly applied for paperwork only after matching a qualified worker to and available job.\nAccording to the indictment, several of the I-129 petitions submitted by defendants stated that particular workers had specific jobs waiting for them at designated companies when, in reality, the defendants knew that these jobs did not exist.\nFurther, the defendants allegedly sought the cooperation of third parties to conceal their fraud.\nFor example, defendants allegedly orchestrated payments by Nanosemantics to at least one individual for permission to list his company as the employer for foreign workers even though Nanosemantics actually intended to place the workers elsewhere.\nFurther, defendants allegedly coached foreign workers and others, to respond to government inquiries in a way that would prevent the government from discovering the fraud.\nThe defendants were charged with one count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud and ten counts of substantive visa fraud.\nThe defendants were arrested last week in their respective towns of residence.\nAll three defendants entered pleas of not guilty and were released on bonds. They are next scheduled to appear on May 13, 2019, for a status conference before Judge Edward J Davila, US District Judge.\nIf convicted, the defendants face a maximum sentence of ten years, and a fine of USD 250,000, plus restitution if appropriate for each violation.

Hemalkumar Shah, Sharvil Patel and Brenda Dozier are currently awaiting sentencing.\n\"We here at IRS CI recognise the heartache and concern these crooks cause innocent people. This is why we are eager to team up with our law enforcement partners to track down these impersonators in whatever corner of the globe they may be hiding in,\" said special agent in-charge Mary Hammond of IRS Criminal Investigations, Tampa Field Office.\nJ Russell George, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, said, \"Over the last several years, American taxpayers have been subjected to unprecedented attempts to fraudulently obtain money by individuals impersonating Internal Revenue Service employees.\" \"Victimising taxpayers by impersonating IRS employees is a serious crime,\" he said.

The status of India has now been changed from 'ongoing outbreak' to 'current or past transmission but no current outbreak',\" the ICMR in an official statement said.\nIt said the zika virus strain isolated from Rajasthan matches with the Brazilian zika strain associated with outbreaks, and microcephaly/Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) and that the ICMR-NIV Pune has initiated mice/animal studies to understand the potential of this virus to cause microcephaly or CZS.\n\"Preliminary reports suggest the absence of one known mutation linked with microcephaly. However, further characterization of the strain is required as microcephaly/CZS has several attributable causes,\" the statement stated.\nThe ICMR has also initiated a study to understand the outcomes of pregnancy of women infected with zika and also the occurrence of CZS as well as other neurological malformations in their newborns. The study is being rolled out in Rajasthan in first week of April and in Bhopal by end of April.\nAttempts are also being made to expedite the phase II zika vaccine clinical trials of Bharat Biotech International Ltd. Human surveillance for Zika virus disease in India will be continued. As of now, no cases of Zika virus disease are being reported from any part of the country.\nIn December 2018, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, USA, issued a travel health notice on zika virus in India. The travel advisory depicted that India has an ongoing outbreak of the disease in Rajasthan and its surrounding states.\nThe advisory further cautioned pregnant women not to travel to areas with ongoing zika outbreaks. Women planning pregnancy were also alerted on travel. \"Such an advisory could have serious implications on travel and trade in India,\" Bhargava said.\nRaising concern over the advisory, Bhargava, had said it created an impression that the outbreak of the disease is still continuing.\n\"I wish to bring to your attention that Zika virus outbreak in both Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have now subsided completely. There are no reports of fresh cases and vector indices are also well within acceptable limits.\n\"I urge you to take up the matter with the concerned authorities at CDC and withdraw/modify the travel advisory,\" Bhargava had said in the letter.

Under the swap, a bank would sell US dollars to the RBI and simultaneously agree to buy the same amount of US dollars at the end of the swap period.\nThe US Dollar amount mobilised through this auction would also reflect in RBI's foreign exchange reserves for the tenor of the swap while also reflecting in RBI's forward liabilities, it added.\nIt further said the market participants would be required to place their bids in terms of the premium that they are willing to pay to the RBI for the tenor of the swap, expressed in paisa terms up to two decimal places.\nThe auction would be a multiple-price based auction -- successful bids will get accepted at their respective quoted premium.\nThe minimum size of each bid should be USD 10 million and in multiples of USD 1 million thereafter.\nThe swap will increase India's foreign exchange reserves while injecting liquidity into the financial system.\nThe auction is meant to give RBI greater flexibility in managing banking system cash while helping absorb any potential large dollar inflows, which could make the rupee rise sharply.
