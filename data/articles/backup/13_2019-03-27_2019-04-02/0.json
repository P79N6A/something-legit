Col. Mike Andrews told CNN in a statement. \"We very much regret the current situation facing our F-35 partnership, but the DoD is taking prudent steps to protect the shared investments made in our critical technology,\" he added. The news of the delivery suspension was first reported by Reuters. The announcement comes as the Turkish Foreign Minister heads to Washington for a ministerial meeting marking the 70th anniversary of NATO. Read More Pentagon warns of 'grave consequences' for Turkey if it purchases Russian missile system \"The US continues to warn Turkey of the negative consequences of its announced procurement of the S-400. We have, however, been clear that the acquisition of the S-400 is not compatible with the F-35 and Turkey's continued participation in the F-35 program is at risk,\" Andrews said. Turkey has been involved with the F-35 development for a long time but senior US military and defense officials have long warned Turkey about the consequences of its pursuit of the Russian-made system, saying it was not compatible with NATO systems and posed an intelligence risk to the aircraft. \"While we continue the dialogue with our Turkish counter-parts, the DoD has initiated steps necessary to ensure prudent program planning and resiliency of the F-35 supply chain, as a result, secondary sources of supply for Turkish-produced parts are in development,\" Andrews said. Members of Congress have also sought to block Turkey's receipt of the jet amid the deteriorating relationship between Washington and Ankara over a range of issues. Turkish pilots are currently training with the F-35 jets at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. Several Turkish companies have contributed to the development of the F-35 through work on the Lockheed Martin built airframe and the Pratt and Whitney propulsion system. Turkish firms were also to have a role in the maintenance of the jets. As a program partner, Turkish industries \"are eligible to become suppliers to the global F-35 fleet for the life of the program,\" according to information posted by Lockheed Martin, the jet's manufacturer. The company says Turkey plans to purchase \"100 of the F-35A Conventional Takeoff and Landing variant.\" Twelve countries participate in the F-35 program. The nine partner nations that participated in the plane's development include the US, Turkey, UK, Italy, Netherlands, Canada, Australia, Denmark and Norway. All of these countries except for Canada, Denmark and Turkey are already receiving deliveries of the F-35. Israel, Japan and South Korea also have received the jets through foreign military sales. A US defense official previously told CNN that a major concern is that the S-400, particularly if it's plugged into Turkey's integrated air defense system, could gather technical data on the F-35's capabilities and that critical information could be passed to Moscow either intentionally or unintentionally through a back door in the Russian-designed system. \"This issue, the S-400, is a tough issue. And we're having a hard time,\" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford said last month at an event at the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC. \"I think both the executive branch of our government, the legislative branch of our government are going to have a hard time reconciling the presence of the S-400 and the most advanced fighter aircraft that we have, the F-35,\" he said, adding \"our position has been made very clear to Turkey.\" \"We're hopeful that we can find a way through this. But it's a tough issue,\" Dunford said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-turkey-f35-exclusive/exclusive-us-sends-message-to-turkey-halts-f-35-equipment-shipments-sources-idUSKCN1RD316"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mike andrews", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T00:02:50.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c131b1a2b435065ea5bc7ff6f1c5bbfc1ea37d9e", "url": "https://openiazoch.zoznam.sk/cl/193743/Kurz-bitcoinu-sa-dostal-na-tohtorocne-maximum-USD", "site_full": "openiazoch.zoznam.sk", "site": "zoznam.sk", "site_section": "https://openiazoch.zoznam.sk/rss.asp", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "oPeniazoch.sk", "title": "Kurz bitcoinu sa dostal na tohtorocne maximum 4135,60 USD", "title_full": "Kurz bitcoinu sa dostal na tohtorocne maximum 4135,60 USD", "published": "2019-04-01T21:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SK", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.openiazoch.zoznam.sk/img/news/crop_orig/5/520321686.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2985, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c131b1a2b435065ea5bc7ff6f1c5bbfc1ea37d9e", "url": "https://openiazoch.zoznam.sk/cl/193743/Kurz-bitcoinu-sa-dostal-na-tohtorocne-maximum-USD", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-01T21:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kurz bitcoinu sa dostal na tohtorocne maximum 4135,60 USD", "text": "Pridajte n\u00e1zor Zdroj: v\u010dera 18:31 - Kurz bitcoinu sa dostal na najvy\u009a\u009aiu \u00farove\u0148 v tomto roku.

Argentina Moves Again to Bolster the World's Weakest Currency (Bloomberg) -- Argentina\u2019s central bank said it won\u2019t allow its key interest rate to drop below 62.5 percent in April, buttressing its campaign to protect the peso.\nThe commitment comes on top of the central bank\u2019s pledge to freeze the monetary supply until the end of the year to cool inflation, part of a record $56 billion credit agreement with the International Monetary Fund. The peso gained as much as 1.5 percent to 42.70 per dollar on Monday, tracking gains in other emerging markets.\nThe latest step comes after a renewed slump in the peso pushed it to a record low on March 27, threatening to fuel an inflation rate that stood at 51 percent in February. Price-growth has proved stubbornly high after the bank eased policy this year, allowing the key rate, known as Leliq, to fall below 60 percent throughout January and February. The rate now stands at 68.2 percent, the highest in the world.\n\"Perseverance in the strict control of the evolution of the monetary base will lead to a reduction in inflation in upcoming months,\" the bank said in a statement after a meeting of its monetary policy committee.\nAll the same, the central bank expects inflation to remain elevated in March and April, based on high-frequency data it monitors.\nToday\u2019s announcement is the latest twist in the past year for the bank, which has had three presidents and a complete policy overhaul on top of the IMF bailout. It pulled out emergency measures last year to handle Argentina\u2019s currency crisis and recession. The peso lost more than half its value against the dollar and the economy fell into recession as investor concern about the nation\u2019s deficits helped spark the peso\u2019s plunge.\nThe government and IMF have long forecast that the economy will start to rebound in the second quarter of this year, backed by Argentina\u2019s soy harvest and exports. Some analysts say a rebound can\u2019t take place with rates and inflation this high. Economic activity barely rose in January compared with December, and fell 5.7 percent from a year ago, according to data published last week.\nFighting inflation while implementing austerity measures is challenging President Mauricio Macri\u2019s bid for re-election this year. His approval ratings declined to 30 percent in March. Argentines will cast their vote on Oct. 27, with a potential runoff vote between the two top candidates set for Nov. 24.\nMeasures the bank took last month included:\nTargeting an additional 10 percent reduction in the monetary base Extending its target for zero growth in the monetary base until December Adjusting its currency band 1.75 percent a month, compared with 2 percent Reducing the amount of dollars the central bank can buy if the peso falls below the currency band floor to $50 million a day from $75 million Expanding the limit Leliq banks can hold (Adds background on central bank in 6th-8th paragraphs.)\nArgentina Moves Again to Bolster the World's Weakest Currency", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=179222828858436&u=https%3A%2F%2Fau.investing.com%2Fnews%2Fforex-news%2Fargentina-moves-again-to-bolster-the-worlds-weakest-currency-1419892&display=popup&ref=plugin", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fau.investing.com%2Fnews%2Fforex-news%2Fargentina-moves-again-to-bolster-the-worlds-weakest-currency-1419892&title=Argentina+Moves+Again+to+Bolster+the+World%27s+Weakest+Currency&summary=", "https://invst.ly/afncr"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "leliq", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg \u00a9 reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "international monetary fund", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "argentina", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T00:03:18.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bcba191816e9f857850240a30b1da31024d5f638", "url": "https://n4g.com/news/2253224/the-last-of-us-part-ii-weapon-upgrade-ui-spotted-in-naughty-dog-promo", "site_full": "n4g.com", "site": "n4g.com", "site_section": "http://n4g.com//rss/news?channel=ps4&sort=today", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "N4G: ps4 news feed", "title": "The Last of Us Part II Weapon Upgrade UI Spotted In Naughty Dog Promo", "title_full": "The Last of Us Part II Weapon Upgrade UI Spotted In Naughty Dog Promo", "published": "2019-04-01T17:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s2.n4g.com/news/2253224_0.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6237, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bcba191816e9f857850240a30b1da31024d5f638", "url": "https://n4g.com/news/2253224/the-last-of-us-part-ii-weapon-upgrade-ui-spotted-in-naughty-dog-promo", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-01T17:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Last of Us Part II Weapon Upgrade UI Spotted In Naughty Dog Promo", "text": "Segata 16h ago Yup, that is a UI to about every modern game these days.

Convicts had to file petitions on their own to get their records changed or hire lawyers for help with the process.\nAfter partnering with the group, the San Francisco district attorney, George Gascon, announced last month that 9,300 cases dating to 1975 would be dropped or reduced for free, and in many cases without the convicts\u2019 knowledge.\nGascon\u2019s office began sifting through thousands of criminal cases last year to identify eligible marijuana convictions after only 23 people who hired lawyers had taken advantage of the new law.\nA few months later, after managing to dismiss just over 1,000 cases during the painstaking work, Gascon partnered with Code for America, a San Francisco group that uses technology to make government more efficient.\nComputer coders with the group developed the Clear My Record algorithm to quickly identify eligible cases and automatically fill out forms to file with the courts.\n\u201cWhen we do this right, we show that government can make good on its promises, especially for the hundreds of thousands who have been denied jobs, housing and other opportunities despite the passage of laws intended to provide relief,\u201d said Jennifer Pahlka, the executive director of Code for America.\n\u201cClear My Record changes the scale and speed of justice and has the potential to ignite change across the state and the nation,\u201d she said.\nProsecutors in Baltimore, Seattle, Chicago and other cities have said they also would clear eligible marijuana convictions.

upbeat mood.

Many believe the technical signal could portend more gains for stocks in the short term. Advertisement\nGains in global equities were spurred by data showing that China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly returned to growth in March for the first time in four months.\n\"The Chinese numbers bounced back, and people are taking more risk today because of it,\" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.\nU.S. manufacturing numbers for March were also better than expected, helping investors overlook soft retail sales data for February.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 329.74 points, or 1.27 percent, to 26,258.42, the S&P 500 gained 32.79 points, or 1.16 percent, to 2,867.19, and the Nasdaq Composite added 99.59 points, or 1.29 percent, to 7,828.91. Advertisement Advertisement\nConcerns about a global economic slowdown have dimmed sentiment since the Federal Reserve announced in late January that its monetary tightening would end earlier than expected, as it cited \"cross currents\" affecting the economy. The shift in Fed policy drove yields on 10-year Treasury notes below those of three-month bills last week for the first time in more than a decade.\nYields on 10-year notes have since risen back above three-month bill rates and on Monday hit a one-week high. Monday's rise in the 10-year Treasury yield helped lift financial shares, which provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500 among the index's 11 sectors. S&P 500 bank shares jumped 2.9 percent.\n\"Treasury yields had priced in a gloomy outlook, and now they're unwinding some of that negativity,\" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. \"So we're seeing money moving back into cyclical areas, which is why financials are big leaders today.\"\nConcerns about slowing momentum have not entirely dissipated. With the first-quarter corporate earnings reporting season about two weeks away, investors are bracing for what may be the first U.S. profit decline since 2016. Analysts expect quarterly earnings to fall 2 percent, according to Refinitiv data. sentifi.com Channel NewsAsia - Sentifi topic widget\nStill, on Monday, most S&P sectors rose. Only consumer staples, real estate and utilities shares, which tend to decline as 10-year Treasury yields rise, were in the red.\nAuto shares rose after China's State Council said on Sunday that the country would continue to suspend additional tariffs on import of U.S. vehicles and auto parts after April 1.\nGeneral Motors Co shares added 1.8 percent and Ford Motor Co shares gained 2.3 percent.\nChipmakers, which draw much of their revenue from China, also rose. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index advanced 2.5 percent.\nShares of Wynn Resorts Ltd jumped 8.4 percent, the most among S&P 500 companies, as March gambling revenue from the Chinese territory of Macau rose from the previous month.\nLyft Inc shares tumbled 11.9 percent to end below their IPO price after brokerage Guggenheim Securities started coverage of the ride-hailing company's shares with a \"neutral\" rating. Lyft debuted on the Nasdaq on Friday.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.99-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.11-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nThe S&P 500 posted 63 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 68 new highs and 28 new lows.\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 7.11 billion shares, compared to the 7.47 billion average over the last 20 trading days.\n(Reporting by April Joyner in New York; Additional reporting by Sruthi Shankar and Shreyashi Sanyal in Bengaluru; Editing by Nick Zieminskiand Leslie Adler) Source: Reuters", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://sentifi.com"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T00:08:10.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ae8d57992a29b05740e9b94c55fb2080e6b087d4", "url": "https://www.nasdaq.com/article/nasdaq-composite-index-closes-up-6016-points-for-the-week-rising-for-the-3rd-straight-day-cm1123033", "site_full": "www.nasdaq.com", "site": "nasdaq.com", "site_section": "https://www.nasdaq.com/news/market-headlines.aspx", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Latest Market News Headlines, Analysis, &amp; Commentary - NASDAQ.com", "title": "NASDAQ Composite Index closes up 60.16 points the week, rising for the 3rd straight day", "title_full": "NASDAQ Composite Index closes up 60.16 points for the week, rising for the 3rd straight day - Nasdaq.com", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/images/dreamit.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2975, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ae8d57992a29b05740e9b94c55fb2080e6b087d4", "url": "https://www.nasdaq.com/article/nasdaq-composite-index-closes-up-6016-points-for-the-week-rising-for-the-3rd-straight-day-cm1123033", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "NASDAQ.com News", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "NASDAQ Composite Index closes up 60.16 points the week, rising for the 3rd straight day", "text": "NASDAQ Composite Index closes up 60.16 points for the week, rising for the 3rd straight day April 01, 2019, 04:45:05 PM EDT By NASDAQ.com News Shutterstock photo\nMonday's session closes with the NASDAQ Composite Index 99.59 This is the 3rd straight day of increase for the index.

Last year, Spotify became the first big technology company to direct list its shares. Companies avoid paying fees by direct listing shares, but there are some risks.\nThe workplace-messaging platform Slack is planning to direct list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange in June or July, according to The Wall Street Journal , citing sources.\nDoing so would make Slack the second big technology company after Spotfiy to bypass a traditional initial public offering.\nA direct listing differs from a traditional IPO in that it cuts out the usual underwriting process that involves lining up investors ahead of time and lets the open market play a larger role in setting the share price.\nThis will allow Slack to avoid paying the hefty fees that are involved in the process, and also can give shares more liquidity by avoiding the lock-up periods associated with going public through a traditional IPO.\n\u201cWhen we think about why companies go public, they do it for liquidity, to raise their profile, for capital,\u201d John Tuttle, head of global listings at NYSE, told Business Insider in February 2018. \u201cBut for those companies that are well-capitalized, all they really need is liquidity.\u201d\nStill, there are some risks involved with a direct listing.

Millennials are about to overtake Baby Boomers as the largest adult generation \u2014 and it could drastically alter the US housing market By April 1, 2019\nMillennials are projected to overtake Baby Boomers as the largest living adult generation. As older generations age and look to sell properties, growth in the rental market could outpace homeownership over the next decade. Americans have already begun to lean toward rentals, as softer construction activity and housing shortages price potential buyers out of the market.\nGrowth in the rental market could outpace homeownership over the next decade as older generations age and look to sell properties, according to analysts.\nHome supply appears set to jump by more than two-thirds over the next 10 years, Morgan Stanley said in a new research note. But demand among generations Y and Z \u2013 which include those born between 1981 and 2012 \u2013 looks poised to edge just 7% higher over that period.\nMillennials are projected to overtake Baby Boomers as the largest living adult generation this year, according to population projections from the US Census Bureau . And with new generations could come an increasing demand for rentals.\n\u201cGen Z + Y are more likely to rent than own, and the bulge in supply when the Baby Boomers sell looks to dampen net single-family demand,\u201d the analysts said. \u201cThis drives a surge in rentership while ownership is challenged.\u201d source Morgan Stanley\nCertain real-estate markets could see more exaggerated shifts toward rental demand than others. New England and the Rust Belt have far more Baby Boomers than other generations, according to Morgan Stanley, while the opposite is the case for the Pacific and the West South Central.\nAmericans have already begun to lean toward rentals, as softer construction activity and housing shortages price potential buyers out of the market. While lower mortgage rates could pull some in from the sidelines, new tax laws have also reduced incentives for Americans to own homes.\n\u201cHome sales are set to tread water over the next couple of years, which is good news for the rental sector,\u201d Capital Economics economists Matthew Pointon and Andrew Burrell said in a research note. \u201cIf Americans aren\u2019t buying homes, many will look to rent one instead.\u201d\nStill, some think demand for homes will hold up among younger generations over the next decade. Millennials still accounted for most of the growth in the overall homeownership rate in 2018, according to Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American.\n\u201cI believe millennials will be the most important generational source of demand in the housing market, as well as the general economy, for a number of years to come,\u201d he said.

After over a decade of training, no one had told me that space smells,\u201d Antonelli says in the video.\n\u201cThe smell was strong and unique, nothing like anything I had ever smelled on Earth before,\u201d he said, describing the scent as \u201csome kind of metallic mixture of other things that I just didn\u2019t know how to describe.\u201d\nThat part of the story is actually true, Alex Walker, a spokesman for Lockheed Martin Space, told Business Insider. caption source Courtesy of Lockheed Martin Space\nAntonelli may have never made it his mission to recreate and bottle the scent \u2013 basically the smell of burnt metal \u2013 for public consumption, as the video claims, but, with his help, Lockheed did manage to develop a scent similar to what Antonelli encountered.\n\u201cWe actually developed fragrance samples based on Tony\u2019s guidance,\u201d Walker said. \u201cHis whole story of the smell of space, we took his guidance down to a local perfumery in Denver and bottled it.\u201d\nThe company created three different scents, and then Lockheed excitedly determined which one most closely matched the smell described by the former Space Shuttle pilot. caption Inside the Vector sample\u2019s packaging. source Courtesy of Lockheed Martin\n\u201cIt\u2019s like one of those fragrance samples you\u2019d get at the mall,\u201d Walker said, adding that the company produced roughly 2,000 sample bottles to hand out at next week\u2019s Space Symposium in Colorado.\nSo Lockheed successfully bottled the so-called \u201csmell of space,\u201d an unbelievable feat done as part of a very elaborate joke.\n\u201cThe reason we did this was to remind that the men and women of Lockheed Martin Space have been building spacecraft for more than sixty years,\u201d Walker told Business Insider.\n\u201cWe thought it was a great time to remind people of that.

April 1, 2019 More\nBy LOLITA C. BALDOR and MATTHEW LEE, Associated Press\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 After months of warnings, the United States has stopped delivery of F-35 fighter jet parts to Turkey in retaliation for Ankara's decision to move ahead with the purchase of a Russian surface-to-air missile system, the Pentagon said Monday.\nTop U.S. government leaders have repeatedly threatened to shut down Turkey's plan to buy the F-35 advanced fighter aircraft if Turkey didn't abandon efforts to buy the S-400 Russian system. Halting the delivery of parts and manuals needed to prepare for the aircraft's planned delivery this summer is the first step toward ending the actual aircraft sale.\n\"The United States has been clear that Turkey's acquisition of the S-400 is unacceptable,\" said acting Pentagon spokesman Charles Summers Jr. \"Until they forgo delivery of the S-400, the United States has suspended deliveries and activities associated with the stand-up of Turkey's F-35 operational capability. Should Turkey procure the S-400, their continued participation in the F-35 program is at risk.\"\nThe U.S. move comes just days after Turkey's foreign minister said his country was committed to the deal to buy the Russian system and was discussing delivery dates.\nAmerican defense and military leaders have said that unless Turkey, a NATO ally, reconsidered its purchase of the S-400, it would forfeit other future American military aircraft and systems. The U.S. and other NATO allies have repeatedly complained about the purchase, saying it is not compatible with other allied systems and would represent a threat to the F-35.\nDuring a Capitol Hill hearing last month, U.S. Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, the top NATO general, said his best military advice would be that the U.S. not work with an ally that's acquiring Russian systems that can threaten one of the American military's most advanced capabilities. Officials have also expressed concerns that Turkey's acquisition of both U.S. and Russian systems could give Moscow access to sophisticated American technology and allow it to find ways to counter the F-35.\nThe U.S. had agreed to sell 100 of its latest, fifth-generation F-35 fighters to Turkey, initially planning to deliver the two aircraft to Turkey in June.\nSummers said that although Washington continues to talk with Turkey about the matter, the Pentagon has begun taking necessary steps to find other sources of supply for the Turkish-produced parts of the F-35. The department, he said, is taking prudent steps to protect the supply chain and the shared investments in the aircraft technology.\nPentagon leaders have warned that ending Turkey's participation in production would likely force other allies to take on that role and could delay aircraft delivery.\nU.S. leaders have pressed Turkey to buy an American-made air defense battery, and in December the State Department approved the sale of a $3.5 billion U.S. Patriot system to Ankara.\nTurkey's foreign minister said Friday his country was committed to buying the Russian missile defense system. Speaking at a joint news conference with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in the Mediterranean coastal city of Antalya, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu ruled out the possibility of Turkey selling the S-400s to another country as suggested by some analysts as a compromise solution.\n\"As a principle, it is contrary to international laws for a third country to oppose an agreement between two countries,\" Cavusoglu said. \"We are committed to this agreement. There can be no such thing as selling to a third country. We are buying them for our own needs.\"\nCavusoglu also insisted Turkey had met all of its obligations concerning the F-35 program.\n___\nAP National Security Writer Robert Burns contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press .

Slack is one of several highly valued private companies eyeing public offerings this year. It\u2019s looking to take the same path to the market as music company Spotify Technology SA, opting for a direct stock listing instead of raising capital through an initial public offering. The San Francisco-based company, which makes chat software for businesses, was valued at $7.1 billion by private investors last year. In February, Slack said it had confidentially filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its offering. A spokeswoman for Slack declined to comment, and the New York Stock Exchange didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported Slack\u2019s listing plans on Monday. Lyft Inc. took the leap to the public markets last week through a traditional IPO. When shares opened Monday, they quickly retreated to below the $72 IPO price, a troubling sign for other unicorns following in its footsteps.

Here are the ones that almost had us convinced More\nAh, April Fools\u2019 Day. It\u2019s the one day of the year when it\u2019s socially acceptable to literally trick our friends and loved ones . It\u2019s also the day when we can\u2019t help but be skeptical of everything we see on social media\u2014 especially when companies roll out new \u201cproduct.\u201d And so far, April Fools\u2019 Day 2019 has delivered. From McDonald\u2019s to Petco, we\u2019re seriously impressed by the brands that have shared creative (and sometimes legitimately genius) gags today. Here are some of the best ones we\u2019ve found. Huda Beauty\nHuda and Mona Kattan of Huda Beauty are constantly releasing innovative and inclusive new products, so when the company launched its \u201csub-brand\u201d PAWfect Beauty, we almost fell for it. Huda Kattan herself unveiled the Coco Lash (named after the Huda Beauty office dog, Coco) in an Instagram video, complete with barking. Dunkin\u2019\nThe donut and coffee chain made a video announcing something called a \u201cSuper Dough Holder,\u201d which to be honest, we almost wish was real. Shake Shack\nShake Shack\u2019s fake line of bottled Shack sauces was definitely too good to be true. It\u2019s too bad because we would actually use a travel-size bottle of this coveted condiment. Petco\nThe pet store introduced a \u201cFurever Weddings\u201d service to help your pets get married. From formal wear to \u201cfur facials,\u201d Petco\u2019s pet wedding planning prank was both hilarious and adorable. Auntie Anne\u2019s\nThe pretzel company made the unexpected announcement today that it would be adding hot yoga studios to its existing locations. Auntie Anne\u2019s wins points for pulling off one of the more elaborate pranks we\u2019ve seen today. The brand launched an entire web page devoted to its new hot yoga classes, which included names of instructors like \u201cGoldie Brown\u201d and a line of yoga mats that we honestly wish was real. You can , however, buy pretzel-themed shirts and leggings at the company\u2019s Threadless shop . ThirdLove\nThe underwear brand released a \u201c24/7 Shimmer Bra\u201d for April Fools\u2019 Day, which is apparently encrusted with Swarovski crystals, rubies, and diamonds. Ultimately, the $1 million price tag tipped us off to the joke. Goldfish\n\u201cIndividually Wrapped Goldfish Crackers\u201d sounds like a special kind of torture, so props to the snack that smiles back for a solid April Fools\u2019 Day prank. Tecovas\nAustin-based Western wear brand Tecovas had us rolling on the floor with their new Rolando and Rolanda boots.\nStay vigilant out there! Hate opening the whole bag for a small handful?

Benchmarks in Taiwan, New Zealand and Southeast Asia also rose. \"It does appear that the cylinders are firing up once again, or at least in China and the U.S., sustaining risk-on mood for Asia markets,\" said Jingyi Pan of IG in a report. Unexpectedly strong U.S. and Chinese factory data \"affirmed the improving manufacturing picture,\" said Pan. On Wall Street, the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index rose Monday for a third day, advancing 1.2% to 2,867.19. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.3% to 26,258.42. The Nasdaq composite climbed 1.3% to 7,828.91. Financial and technology companies powered the latest rally. Investors tend to favor those sectors when they're confident the economy will continue growing. Bank of America gained 3.4% and Intel rose 1.5%. Consumer product makers and utility companies, which are considered safe-play investments, lagged the market. Clorox fell 1.2% and NRG Energy slid 1.7%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose sharply, to 2.47% from 2.41% late Friday. It also rose back above the yield on the three-month Treasury bill. That reverses an inversion in yields that alarmed investors last month. Such a change has preceeded recessions in the past. BREXIT: Legislators rejected four proposed alternatives to Britain's separation from the European Union that would have softened or halted the departure. With 12 days until the U.K. must come up with a new plan or crash out of the trade bloc in chaos, the House of Commons threw out options designed to replace Prime Minister Theresa May's thrice-rejected deal. The result leaves May facing difficult choices including calling a possible snap election to shake up Parliament. KEEBLER SALE: Kellogg Co. agreed to sell brands including Keebler and Famous Amos cookies to Italian confectioner Ferrero SpA, best known for making Nutella. The price of $1.3 billion is about $2.6 billion less than Kellogg paid for Keebler 17 years ago. The value of household names like Keebler has deteriorated as families turn to food and snack alternatives that are thought to be healthier. The sale includes Kellogg's fruit-flavored snack, pie crust and ice cream cone businesses. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude gained 32 cents to $61.91 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract surged $1.45 on Monday to close at $61.59.

Nasdaq.com", "text": "Here's Why You Should Invest in ResMed (RMD) Stock Right Now April 01, 2019, 09:10:00 AM EDT By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo\nResMed Inc. RMD continues to see strong sales from Software-as-a-Service (\"SaaS\") business as well as new mask products and devices. Steady growth in Brightree service offerings and incremental contribution from the buyouts of MatrixCare and HEALTHCAREfirst are driving the Software-as-a-Service business.\nOver the past month, the stock has outperformed its industry . The stock has gained 2% in comparison with the industry's 0.8% rise and the S&P 500's 1.5% increase.\nThis leading designer, manufacturer, as well as a distributor in the worldwide market for generators, masks, and related accessories for the treatment of sleep-disordered breathing and other respiratory disorders has a market cap of $14.90 billion.\nWith solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is an attractive pick for investors at the moment.\nWhat's Working in Favor of the Stock?\nBuyouts to Boost SaaS Business\nResMed has been continuously opting for buyouts to boost revenues from SaaS business. The company witnessed a 63.3% rise in revenues from the SaaS business in the fiscal second quarter on consistently growing Brightree service offerings and incremental contributions from the MatrixCare and HEALTHCAREfirst buyouts.\nNotably, ResMed had completed the acquisition of MatrixCare in November 2018. MatrixCare's offerings include point of care, lead and referral management, claims processing plus payroll and nutrition management, among others. According to ResMed, this buyout will enhance its ability to improve patient transitions of care and provider efficiencies.\nThis apart, ResMed acquired Apacheta Corporation, a cloud-based Software as a Service provider offering mobile applications through Brightree. ResMed expects to accelerate growth within its core Brightree software business through this buyout.\nIncreased Focus on International Markets\nResMed continues to invest and expand its presence in high-growth markets like China, South Korea, India, Brazil and many countries in Eastern Europe. Interestingly, in each of these regions, ResMed is implementing long-term strategies to improve quality of patient life for the purpose of delivering better patient outcomes and reduce overall system healthcare costs in every country. ResMed is also currently focusing on consolidating its strong presence in Europe with respect to its life support ventilation solutions and non-invasive ventilation solutions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and neuromuscular disease.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2019, revenues from the combined Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific (APAC) region registered 1% growth at constant exchange rate (CER) from a year ago.\nIncreasing Opportunities in New Markets\nThe third growth horizon of ResMed's three-pronged growth strategy requires preparing a portfolio to exploit opportunities in new markets, including clinical adjacencies such as atrial fibrillation, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, asthma, chronic disease management as well as sleep health and wellness. Another key area is ResMed's work on chronic disease management algorithms, including population health models, health care analytics, care co-ordination and SaaS models for home health, home nursing and hospice. In this area, the company is seeing steady growth in Brightree service offerings and incremental contribution from the buyouts of MatrixCare and HEALTHCAREfirst.\nWhich Way Are Estimates Treading?\nFor the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 84 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 8.7%. The same for revenues stands at $663.5 million, mirroring a 12.2% improvement year over year.\nFor fiscal 2019, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is at $3.55, reflecting 0.6% year-over-year growth. The same for revenues stands at $2.60 billion, indicating a rise of 11%.\nOther Key Picks\nOther top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Penumbra, Inc. PEN , Amedisys, Inc. AMED and Hologic, Inc. HOLX .\nPenumbra's long-term earnings growth rate is expected at 20.9%. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2.

This idea has become known as Beringian Standstill. Those founders had split from known populations in Siberian Asia some 40,000 years ago, come across Beringia, and stayed put until around 16,000 years ago.\nLink:\nA New History of the First Peoples in the Americas 4 posted on 04/01/2019 1:17:15 PM PDT by deport [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies ] To: rktman\nI\u2019ve been sayin\u2019 all along and I keep on sayin\u2019, \u201cDeploy the army now.\u201d What else is an army for, if not to defend a nation\u2019s borders? 5 posted on 04/01/2019 1:24:17 PM PDT by Mr Radical (In times of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies ] To: rktman\nWhat we need are minefields, or something else to drive up the risk to the point where it\u2019s not worth it. 6 posted on 04/01/2019 1:28:24 PM PDT by thoughtomator (The Clinton Coup attempt was a worse attack on the USA than was 9/11) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies ] To: deport They must have used the Aleutians to get here before glow bull warming caused the oceans to rise and flood the bridge. \uf640\uf479 7 posted on 04/01/2019 1:31:04 PM PDT by rktman ( #My2ndAmend!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "columbus", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "americas", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "americas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beringia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T00:19:13.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9bcd11fef8e16ec3149013edd493b91b6c40ffa4", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4252185-apple-will-return-minimum-8-percent-end-fy19", "site_full": "seekingalpha.com", "site": "seekingalpha.com", "site_section": "http://seekingalpha.com/feed.xml", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "mutual_funds"], "section_title": "All Articles on Seeking Alpha", "title": "How Apple Will Return A Minimum Of 8% By The End Of FY19 - Apple Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)", "text": "Thesis: Apple ( AAPL ) is at a price point, which I believe offers attractive return potential to investors on cost. While Apple has seen iPhone sales decline significantly in 1Q19 from 1Q18, I believe growth in its other segments (Mac, iPad, etc.) as well as the proprietary nature of those products will stabilize the iPhone sales decline and result in FY19 revenue growth. Growth in the smartphone market has also crushed forecasts and is still poised for strong growth moving forward; a macro trend that plays well for Apple, considering it controls approximately 24% of the global smartphone market share. With that being said, I recommend Apple shares at current prices and anticipate them to return approximately 8% with dividends to shareholders by the end of FY19 on cost.\n( Image Source )\nApple\u2019s Strong Product Segment Growth And What It Can Do For iPhone Sales: Other than iPhones, Apple grew all of its other segments in 1Q19 from 1Q18. It saw approximately 8.7% growth in Mac sales, 16.9% growth in iPad sales, 33.3% growth in Wearables, Home, and Accessories sales, and 19.1% growth in Services sales. All the while, iPhone sales fell 15%, resulting in a net sales loss of approximately 4.5%. While seeing Apple\u2019s trademark product lose 15% in net sales from the same time a year ago is intimidating, I believe Apple\u2019s proprietary product line will stabilize iPhone sales moving forward. What I mean by stabilize is, I believe iPhone sales will be equal to or greater than (15%) in the remaining three quarters of FY19 in comparison to the respective quarter in FY18. Apple\u2019s products are extraordinarily integrated with one another. As Apple\u2019s other segments grow, I anticipate the proprietary nature of Apple\u2019s products will stimulate iPhone sales, as it\u2019s essentially necessary for compatibility purposes.\n( Image and Information Source - Page 1 )\nGlobal Smartphone Market Growth Crushes Forecasts And Breeds iPhone Sales Growth Hopes: Global smartphone market growth crushed Statista forecasts. The most recent data from data pegged 1.86 billion active smartphones at the end of 2015, with forecasts for that number to reach 2.53 billion by the end of 2018. However, a report by Newzoo found that there were roughly 3.3 billion active smartphones globally by June of 2018. With approximately 3.3 billion smartphones by the end of FY18, actual growth outperformed forecasts by 30.43% and grew at a CAGR of 21% from FY15\u2019s figure of 1.86 billion. Newzoo is forecasting 3.8 billion global smartphone users by 2021, which would represent a CAGR of 7.4% from FY19 to FY20.\n( Image Source )\nApple currently controls 24% of the global smartphone market share with 800.7 million active devices as of June of 2018. Should Apple maintain a market share close to 24%, it should be able to realize approximately 1.78% CAGR growth in iPhone sales over the next couple years from global smartphone growth. I get that figure by taking Apple\u2019s market share portion of the global smartphone user growth rate of 7.4%.\n( Image Source )\nSeeing strong growth in global smartphone users is beneficial for all players in the smartphone industry. The figures above show the amount of growth potential that still exists in the global smartphone market, and I believe Apple will find a way to take its share. In all, based on the data above, we can expect Apple to see iPhone sales naturally grow by approximately 1.78% over the next couple years so long as global smartphone market forecasts are met.\nI personally don\u2019t anticipate Apple seeing many more quarters of iPhone sales decline, at least at the level that we saw in 1Q19. Apple is set to release 2Q19 earnings on 05/07/2019, which is going to provide valuable data to interpret. However, in the meantime, I am going to run my quantitative analysis on the contingency that Apple loses 15% of iPhone sales in each of the remaining FY19 quarters in respect to the same quarter a year ago. I would like to note that should Apple produce iPhone sales > (15%), identical sales, or iPhone sales growth in any of the remaining FY19 quarters from the same respective quarter in FY18, the value of the opportunity I\u2019m addressing in this article gains more depth.\nQuantitative Analysis: Apple\u2019s 1Q19 revenue was $84,310 million, with 61.65% of that coming from iPhone sales, and 38.35% of it coming from its other segments. I would like to note that iPhone sales accounted for approximately 69% of Apple\u2019s revenue in 1Q18. While iPhone sales declined 15%, I do anticipate them to grow at a rate of 1.78% derived from global smartphone market growth of 7.4% in relativity to Apple\u2019s global smartphone market share of 24%. I forecasted Apple's 2Q19-4Q19 iPhone sales figures by cutting the previous years' quarter by 15% then multiplying the sum by the growth rate of 1.78%. This method of forecasting anticipates and accounts for 15% losses in iPhone sales in 2Q19-4Q19, accompanied by a modest growth rate of 1.78%. Using the data above gives us 2Q19 iPhone sales of $38,362 million, 3Q19 iPhone sales of $35,399 million, and 4Q19 iPhone sales of $41,803 million.\nApple\u2019s other segment revenue (Mac, iPad, Wearables, Home, and Accessories, and Services) accounts for 38.35% of its revenue. Combined, other segment revenue came to $27,189 million in 1Q18. In 1Q19, other segment revenue came to $32,328 million combined, representing YoY growth of 18.9%. I anticipate that Apple will see slightly lower YoY quarterly segment growth of 15% in 2Q19\u20134Q19. I forecasted other segment revenue using a nearly identical method as I did forecasting iPhone revenue for FY19. I take 38.35% of previous years\u2019 respective quarterly revenue, as that\u2019s the percentage that accounts for Apple\u2019s other segments. I then multiply each quarter\u2019s revenue figure by the growth rate, in this case 15%, to get our forecasted segment revenue for 2Q19\u20134Q19. This gives us 2Q19 other segment revenue of $26,963 million, 3Q19 other segment revenue of $23,491 million, and 4Q19 other segment revenue of $27,740 million.\n( Image Source )\nNOTE: The graphic above is a visual representation of why I am forecasting Apple\u2019s 2Q19\u20134Q19 revenues using the same quarter from a year ago versus the most recent quarter. A consistent quarterly sales pattern develops in 1Q12 and carries on to the end of the graph. Apple obviously sees extraordinary first quarter results as a result of the holiday season, thus, we can\u2019t use 1Q data to predict 2Q and vice versa.\nCombining our 2Q19\u20134Q19 iPhone revenue forecasts and other segment revenue forecasts gives us a forecasted FY19 total revenue figure of $278,068 million, representing 4.7% growth from FY18. Apple has a five-year average net margin of 22%, which I believe will be maintained. With a 22% net margin, we get a forecasted FY19 net income figure of $61,175 million, which translates to forecasted FY19 EPS of $12.95. Apple has traded at a five-year average P/E ratio of 15.7, which is a reasonable earnings multiple for Apple. With our forecasted FY19 EPS of $12.95 and an earnings multiple of 15.7, we get a FY19 price target of $203.32, representing upside potential of 7.95% on current cost. Apple also provides a 1.55% dividend yield on cost, which would translate to a return of 9.5% on cost if held for at least a year.\nThe Opportunity at Hand: The opportunity at hand is brought to fruition by Apple\u2019s ability to grow its other segments at impressive rates, and its ability to produce earnings growth in the same quarter that iPhone sales - 61.65% of Apple\u2019s revenue stream - dropped 15%. In my quantitative analysis, I outline how Apple can grow FY19 year-end revenue by approximately 4.7% from FY18. With upside potential of as much as 9.5% amidst struggling iPhone sales, a valuable opportunity exists within Apple under the contingency that it can stimulate iPhone sales before the end of FY19. Even with iPhone sales dropping 15% with each preceding quarter of FY19 on a YoY basis, I still forecast solid revenue and earnings growth. With that being said, Apple\u2019s 2Q19 earnings report will provide strong insight into how iPhone sales are currently faring. If Apple can post strong 2Q19 iPhone sales, I strongly believe its stock and shareholders will be duly rewarded.\nAssociated Risks: While I feel confident in Apple\u2019s competitive edge and ability to thrive in both the short and long term, there are certainly some risks to keep in mind. In Apple\u2019s case, I currently only find one big concern, and I think it\u2019s obvious - market share loss.\nI have worries that Apple may be overly focused on catering to the high-end cell phone market. All of Apple\u2019s devices are top-end. However, its quality comes with a price tag that many can\u2019t afford, especially in developing markets, which is where Apple is losing ground to the likes of Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ). In fact, Samsung has passed Apple as the leader in the global smartphone market, controlling 27% compared to Apple\u2019s 24%. It\u2019s also not good seeing Samsung passing Apple due what appears to be market share absorption, as Apple lost users while Samsung gained them.\nChina also has some other big players in the global smartphone market that are proving to hurt Apple. Oppo, Xiaomi, Huawei, and Vivo are the world\u2019s 3 rd , 4 th , 5 th , and 6 th largest global smartphone providers respectively, and control 33% of the global market combined. These companies are making impressive smartphone devices with starting prices of less than half of that of Apple\u2019s cheapest model of the new iPhone. The graphic below shows the margin gap between Apple and Samsung. However, margins can only make up for so much of a lack of sales. Apple saw iPhone sales in the Greater China region drop 27% in 1Q19 from 1Q18. If Apple doesn\u2019t find a way to cater to lower-end markets, I\u2019m concerned its global smartphone market share may be in serious danger.\nWith iPhones consisting of 61.65% of Apple\u2019s revenue stream, it can take many more sales loss hits without putting Apple\u2019s stock in jeopardy. If iPhone sales plummet, Apple could see quite large market price drops. Due to the weight that Apple investors put on iPhone sales, and considering they\u2019ve been rocky, I believe an investment in Apple could drop as much as 25% in market value should iPhone sales remain turbulent. While Apple is not a volatile company, it has seen price drops of that significance in the past. Most recently, it dropped from roughly $225 per share in October of 2018 to around $148 per share by January of 2019, roughly a 35% drop in market price in under a quarter.\nWith that being said, I believe in Apple\u2019s ability to recapture global smartphone market share and compete at a superior level to its peers. However, market share is something worth monitoring without bias, as even Apple could face serious trouble should it start losing too much market share.\nConclusion: In conclusion, I believe Apple\u2019s other segment growth will help stabilize and potentially stimulate iPhone sales. I believe this has a likely chance of occurring due to the proprietary nature of Apple\u2019s product line. In turn, global smartphone users are still exhibiting strong growth, providing an opportunity for Apple to regain and continue to grow its market share. Apple has fared well recently with all things considered. Even with slumping iPhone sales, my analysis still paints Apple as undervalued. If Apple produces strong iPhone sales moving forward in FY19, they will reap the benefits. In fact, if Apple posts identical iPhone sales in 2Q19, I could see its stock arriving at a $225 price target before the end of FY19, representing upside of nearly 20%. If Apple posts results similar to what they produced in 1Q19, I forecast they will reach my other price target of $203.32, representing 7.95% upside before dividends, and a 9.5% upside after dividends on current cost. With that being said, I recommend shares of Apple at current prices with an expected return of at least 8% by the end of FY19.\nDisclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.

During the same six-month period, about 15 percent of arriving refugees were Muslim.\nThe State Department data, which is updated daily and includes demographic information like gender and religion, indicates the gap between religions is widening.\nA VOA report in June 2018 showed that the top three countries of origin for arriving refugees were the same as now (DRC, Ukraine and Burma) and that nearly 68 percent of arriving refugees were Christian.\nThat number has climbed throughout Trump's nearly two and a half years in office.In January 2018, VOA documented arriving refugees, which under the presidencies of G.W. Bush and Barack Obama were about half Christian and one-third Muslim, were skewing increasingly more Christian.\nThat level continues to increase, with Christians accounting for four of every five refugees coming to the U.S. this fiscal year.\nThe reduction in refugee arrivals to the U.S. means more refugees who are deemed in need of resettlement meaning it is unsafe for them in their home country or remain in their country of asylum are not able to relocate. It has also led to layoffs in the refugee resettlement community. Over the weekend, one of the main resettlement agencies, World Relief, announced it was closing its office in Akron, Ohio.\n'As the U.S. government decreases the number of refugees admitted into the U.S. and has also signaled an intent to reduce the longstanding public/private partnership with refugee resettlement agencies, World Relief unfortunately needs to reduce its footprint nationally,' the agency said in a news release Friday.

Baldor And Matthew Lee The WASHINGTON - After months of warnings, the United States has stopped delivery of F-35 fighter jet parts to Turkey in retaliation for Ankara\u2019s decision to move ahead with the purchase of a Russian surface-to-air missile system, the Pentagon said Monday.\nTop U.S. government leaders have repeatedly threatened to shut down Turkey\u2019s plan to buy the F-35 advanced fighter aircraft if Turkey didn\u2019t abandon efforts to buy the S-400 Russian system. Halting the delivery of parts and manuals needed to prepare for the aircraft\u2019s planned delivery this summer is the first step toward ending the actual aircraft sale.\n\u201cThe United States has been clear that Turkey\u2019s acquisition of the S-400 is unacceptable,\u201d said acting Pentagon spokesman Charles Summers Jr. \u201cUntil they forgo delivery of the S-400, the United States has suspended deliveries and activities associated with the stand-up of Turkey\u2019s F-35 operational capability. Should Turkey procure the S-400, their continued participation in the F-35 program is at risk.\u201d\nThe U.S. move comes just days after Turkey\u2019s foreign minister said his country was committed to the deal to buy the Russian system and was discussing delivery dates.\nAmerican defence and military leaders have said that unless Turkey, a NATO ally, reconsidered its purchase of the S-400, it would forfeit other future American military aircraft and systems. The U.S. and other NATO allies have repeatedly complained about the purchase, saying it is not compatible with other allied systems and would represent a threat to the F-35.\nArticle Continued Below During a Capitol Hill hearing last month, U.S. Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, the top NATO general, said his best military advice would be that the U.S. not work with an ally that\u2019s acquiring Russian systems that can threaten one of the American military\u2019s most advanced capabilities.

Halting the delivery of parts and manuals needed to prepare for the aircraft's planned delivery this summer is the first step toward ending the actual aircraft sale.\nThe U.S. move comes just days after Turkey's foreign minister said his country was committed to the deal to buy the Russian system and was discussing delivery dates.\nAmerican defense and military leaders have said that unless Turkey, a NATO ally, reconsidered its purchase of the S-400, it would forfeit other future American military aircraft and systems. The U.S. and other NATO allies have repeatedly complained about the purchase, saying it is not compatible with other allied systems and would represent a threat to the F-35.\nDuring a Capitol Hill hearing last month, U.S. Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, the top NATO general, said his best military advice would be that the U.S. not work with an ally that's acquiring Russian systems that can threaten one of the American military's most advanced capabilities. Officials have also expressed concerns that Turkey's acquisition of both U.S. and Russian systems could give Moscow access to sophisticated American technology and allow it to find ways to counter the F-35.\nThe U.S. had agreed to sell 100 of its latest, fifth-generation F-35 fighters to Turkey, initially planning to deliver the two aircraft to Turkey in June.\nU.S. officials said that although Washington continues to talk with Turkey about the matter, the Pentagon has begun taking necessary steps to find other sources of supply for the Turkish-produced parts of the F-35.

Under the agreement, Tesla will take specific steps to properly manage hazardous wastes at its factory. Tesla will also purchase $55,000 in emergency response equipment for the City of Fremont Fire Department and pay a $31,000 penalty.\n\u201cIt's vital that businesses comply with hazardous waste laws that keep facilities safe for workers and the community,\u201d said EPA Pacific Southwest Regional Administrator Mike Stoker. \u201cWe are pleased that this settlement will bring much needed emergency response equipment to the City of Fremont.\u201d\nAs a result of the inspections, EPA determined that Tesla: failed to comply with air emissions standards for equipment leaks; failed to comply with management requirements for generators of hazardous wastes; and failed to make an adequate hazardous waste determination for certain solid waste generated at the facility.\nIn addition to paying the $31,000 penalty, Tesla is required to complete a supplemental environmental project to purchase and provide at least $55,000 worth of emergency response equipment for the City of Fremont Fire Department. This equipment will improve the department\u2019s ability to respond to hazardous materials incidents. The company has since addressed all the identified violations and has come into compliance with RCRA requirements. Tesla also delivered hazardous waste training to over 1,100 paint shop associates, technicians and supervisors at its facility.\nEPA led unannounced inspections at the Fremont facility in 2017 along with the California Department of Toxic Substances Control and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. The inspections identified violations of federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations. RCRA rules require the safe management of hazardous waste to protect public health and the environment and to prevent costly cleanups. The settlement is part of the EPA\u2019s National Compliance initiative to reduce hazardous air emissions at hazardous waste facilities.\nFor more information about the National Compliance initiative, please visit: https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/national-compliance-initiative-reducing-hazardous-air-emissions-hazardous-waste\nFor more information on RCRA, please visit: www.epa.gov/rcra # # # Contact Us to ask a question, provide feedback, or report a problem.

The grant runs for three years, through September 2021.\nThe funds are part of a performance partnership grant (PPG), which are given to states to help implement environmental programs that they have authority to run. Through this grant, NHDES will administer environmental programs for air, water and waste with flexibility to direct resources where they are most needed to address environmental and public health priorities.\n\"This grant gives New Hampshire the capacity to advance its work on a range of priority environmental issues across the state,\" said EPA New England acting Regional Administrator Deb Szaro. \"EPA is committed to providing funding to states across New England to enable them to deliver critical environmental and public health safeguards for residents and local communities.\"\nFunding will help protect citizens and the environment in New Hampshire by supporting the state's effort to reduce air and water pollution, improve waste management and promote pollution prevention and sustainable practices. NHDES will use a portion of the funding on public drinking water maintenance and supervision as well as and public beach protection.\nPPGs are important tools that allow EPA to provide financial assistance to states and tribes. These grants allow recipients to use EPA awards with greater flexibility for priority environmental problems or program needs, streamline paperwork and accounting procedures to reduce administrative costs, and try cross-program initiatives and approaches that were difficult to fund under traditional category grants.\nEPA's foundational laws, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, allow the agency to delegate authority to the states or local governments to implement and enforce those laws. These delegated entities may also develop their own regulations if they are more stringent than federal requirements. Contact Us to ask a question, provide feedback, or report a problem.

They were detained the same day.\nThe father has said that the boy was in good health when they were taken into custody. But days later he had flu symptoms and was brought to a hospital, where he died.\nGomez was the second Guatemalan migrant child to die in U.S. custody in December.\nAn autopsy released Friday on the other child, 7-year-old Jakelin Caal Maquin, found that her death Dec. 8 was also due to bacterial infection.\nThat report found bacteria in her lungs, liver, spleen and adrenal glands and said she suffered a rapid, progressive infection that led to multiple organ failure.\n\"We have not been able to establish where they were infected,\" Padilla said of Gomez and Caal. \"We do not know if it was in Mexico or in border custody. What we know is that the children left their homes healthy.\"\nJohana Samayoa, chief of chronic infections at the Roosevelt Hospital in Guatemala, said these kinds of infections typically have an incubation period of eight days and can be deadly if not treated, especially in combination with other factors such as malnutrition.\nIn recent days U.S. President Donald Trump has said he will cut aid to Guatemala as well as neighboring El Salvador and Honduras over Central American migration to the United States.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAssociated Press writer Susan Montoya in Albuquerque contributed to this report.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nA previous version of this story was corrected to reflect that autopsy details were about the girl who died, not the boy. bubble_chat", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sonia perez d. associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oscar padilla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "felipe gomez alonzo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catarina gomez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "abc news internet ventures", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sonia perez d. associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "guatemala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guatemala city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yalambojoch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T00:29:27.046+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0342d1b3bf621d84024278dd0d9b242a75cf7b40", "url": "https://www.foxsports.com/kansas-city/video/1468787267873", "site_full": "www.foxsports.com", "site": "foxsports.com", "site_section": "http://api.foxsports.com/v1/rss?partnerKey=zBaFxRyGKCfxBagJG9b8pqLyndmvo7UU&tag=kansas-city", "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "FOX Sports Digital", "title": "Yost on Giolito\u2019s no-hit bid against Royals: \u2018He\u2019s always good against us\u2019", "title_full": "Yost on Giolito\u2019s no-hit bid against Royals: \u2018He\u2019s always good against us\u2019", "published": "2019-04-01T00:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://b.fssta.com/uploads/2019/03/2019-03-31T21-21-30.633Z-1280x720.vresize.1200.630.high.75.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1307, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0342d1b3bf621d84024278dd0d9b242a75cf7b40", "url": "https://www.foxsports.com/kansas-city/video/1468787267873", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-01T00:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Yost on Giolito\u2019s no-hit bid against Royals: \u2018He\u2019s always good against us\u2019", "text": "FS1 | FOX | FOX News | Fox Corporation | FOX Supports | FOX Deportes\n\u2122 and \u00a9 2019 Fox Media LLC and Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.

Oscar Padilla, Guatemalan consul in Phoenix, Arizona, told The Associated Pres that a report on the autopsy of Felipe Gomez Alonzo was delivered in recent days and had found he died from the infection and \"complications from influenza B.\" The New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator said Monday that the report is still open and has not been finalized. The office previously reported in a Dec. 27 statement that the boy tested positive for the flu based on swabs of the lungs and nasal passage, but that \"determining an accurate cause of death requires further evaluation.\" Gomez and his 47-year-old father, Agustin Gomez, fled the poverty of their home village of Yalambojoch and crossed in the United States on Dec. 18 at El Paso, Texas. They were detained the same day. The father has said that the boy was in good health when they were taken into custody. But days later he had flu symptoms and was brought to a hospital, where he died. Gomez was the second Guatemalan migrant child to die in U.S. custody in December. An autopsy released Friday on the other child, 7-year-old Jakelin Caal Maquin, found that her death Dec. 8 was also due to bacterial infection. That report found bacteria in her lungs, liver, spleen and adrenal glands and said she suffered a rapid, progressive infection that led to multiple organ failure. \"We have not been able to establish where they were infected,\" Padilla said of Gomez and Caal. \"We do not know if it was in Mexico or in border custody.

In recent days U.S. President Donald Trump has said he will cut aid to Guatemala as well as neighboring El Salvador and Honduras over Central American migration to the United States. ___ Associated Press writer Susan Montoya in Albuquerque contributed to this report. ___ A previous version of this story was corrected to reflect that autopsy details were about the girl who died, not the boy.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "oscar padilla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gomez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "felipe gomez alonzo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "agustin gomez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "new mexico office of the medical investigator", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated pres", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "guatemala city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guatemala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yalambojoch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el paso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phoenix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T00:30:08.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "49d60a1062e58e1d5b18ded6773d8b6512c0245a", "url": "https://www.tovima.gr/2019/04/02/%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%b1%ce%be%ce%b9%ce%bd%cf%8c%ce%bc%ce%b7%cf%84%ce%b1/us-freezes-delivery-of-f-35-fighter-equipment-for-erdogan-to-back-down-on-s-400s/", "site_full": "www.tovima.gr", "site": "tovima.gr", "site_section": "http://www.tovima.gr/feed/allnews", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "\u0395\u03b9\u03b4\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u2013 \u03bd\u03ad\u03b1 \u2013 \u03a4\u03bf \u0392\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1 Online", "title": "US freezes delivery of F-35 fighter equipment for Erdogan to back down on S-400s", "title_full": "US freezes delivery of F-35 fighter equipment for Erdogan to back down on S-400s", "published": "2019-04-02T00:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.tovima.gr/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/01/trumpster1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7172, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "49d60a1062e58e1d5b18ded6773d8b6512c0245a", "url": "https://www.tovima.gr/2019/04/02/%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%b1%ce%be%ce%b9%ce%bd%cf%8c%ce%bc%ce%b7%cf%84%ce%b1/us-freezes-delivery-of-f-35-fighter-equipment-for-erdogan-to-back-down-on-s-400s/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ggilson", "published": "2019-04-02T00:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "US freezes delivery of F-35 fighter equipment for Erdogan to back down on S-400s", "text": "US freezes delivery of F-35 fighter equipment for Erdogan to back down on S-400s \u03a4\u03bf\u0392\u0397\u039c\u0391 Team | 02.04.2019 - 00:27 FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan gesture as they talk at the start of the NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium July 11, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo\nThe United States has halted delivery of equipment related to the stealthy F-35 fighter aircraft to Turkey, a Pentagon spokesman said on 1 April, marking the first concrete U.S. step to block delivery of the jet to the NATO ally in light of Ankara\u2019s planned purchase of a Russian missile defense system.\nIn recent days, U.S. officials told their Turkish counterparts they will not receive further shipments of F-35 related equipment needed to prepare for the arrival of the stealthy jet, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday.\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan has refused to back down from Ankara\u2019s planned purchase of a Russian S-400 missile defense system that the United States has said would compromise the security of F-35 aircraft.\n\u201cPending an unequivocal Turkish decision to forgo delivery of the S-400, deliveries and activities associated with the stand-up of Turkey\u2019s F-35 operational capability have been suspended,\u201d Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Mike Andrews, a Defense Department spokesman, said in a statement.\nTurkey has said it will take delivery of the S-400s in July.\nThe sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the next shipment of training equipment, and all subsequent shipments of F-35 related material, had been canceled. The aircraft is built by Lockheed Martin Corp. The disagreement over the F-35 is the latest of a series of diplomatic disputes between the United States and Turkey including Turkish demands that the United States extradite Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, differences over Middle East policy and the war in Syria, and sanctions on Iran.\nA Pentagon official had told Reuters in March that the United States had a number of items it could withhold in order to send Turkey a signal that the United States was serious about Ankara dropping its ambition to own the S-400. Turkish officials in Ankara were not immediately available for comment.\nNato summit\nThe U.S. decision on the F-35s was expected to complicate Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu\u2019s planned visit to Washington this week for a NATO summit. The latest development in the F-35 dispute came a day after Erdogan suffered one of his biggest electoral losses in decades in local elections.\nReuters reported last week that Washington was exploring whether it could remove Turkey from production of the F-35. Turkey makes parts of the fuselage, landing gear and cockpit displays. Sources familiar with the F-35\u2019s intricate worldwide production process and U.S. thinking on the issue last week said Turkey\u2019s role can be replaced.\nThe United States and other NATO allies that own F-35s fear the radar on the Russian S-400 missile system will learn how to spot and track the jet, making it less able to evade Russian weapons in the future.\nIn an attempt to persuade Turkey to drop its plans to buy the S-400, the United States offered the pricier American-made Patriot anti-missile system in a discounted deal that expired at the end of March. Turkey has shown interest in the Patriot system, but not at the expense of abandoning the S-400.\nTurkey has engaged with U.S. negotiators in recent days about buying the Patriot system, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The system is made by Raytheon Co.\nTurkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar in March said that despite some issues, Turkish pilots were continuing their training at an air base in Arizona on the F-35, each of which costs $90 million, and that Ankara was expecting the aircraft to arrive in Turkey in November.\nU.S. lawmakers also have expressed alarm over Turkey\u2019s planned purchase of the Russian system. Four U.S. senators last week introduced a bipartisan bill that would prohibit the transfer of F-35s to Turkey until the U.S. government certifies that Ankara will not take delivery of the S-400 system. \u0394\u03b5\u03af\u03c4\u03b5 \u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "erdogan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T00:30:49.044+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "67174ac21a38f95472f84ad2426bcde2c238fba3", "url": "https://www.foxbusiness.com/industrials/tesla-will-pay-31000-to-settle-us-epa-hazardous-waste-claims", "site_full": "www.foxbusiness.com", "site": "foxbusiness.com", "site_section": "https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Politics | Fox Business", "title": "Tesla will pay $31,000 to settle US EPA hazardous waste claims", "title_full": "Tesla will pay $31,000 to settle US EPA hazardous waste claims | Fox Business", "published": "2019-04-02T00:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/08/0/0/2018-08-14T124620Z_1_LYNXMPEE7D11K_RTROPTP_4_TESLA-MUSK-MARKETS.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5795, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "67174ac21a38f95472f84ad2426bcde2c238fba3", "url": "https://www.foxbusiness.com/industrials/tesla-will-pay-31000-to-settle-us-epa-hazardous-waste-claims", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Reuters", "published": "2019-04-02T00:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "Tesla will pay $31,000 to settle US EPA hazardous waste claims", "text": "Tesla will pay $31,000 to settle US EPA hazardous waste claims Published April 01, 2019 Tesla Reuters\n video Tesla is not a company that\u2019s slowing down production: Wedbush\u2019s Daniel Ives Wedbush managing director Daniel Ives discusses why he raised his price target for Apple and gives his outlook on Tesla.\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla Inc will pay a $31,000 penalty and purchase $55,000 in emergency response equipment for a California city under a settlement reached with the Environmental Protection Agency over federal hazardous waste violations at its automotive factory, the government said Monday.\nThe EPA said in a statement that Tesla will take specific steps to properly manage hazardous wastes at its factory after unannounced inspections in 2017 to its Fremont, California factory.\nThe EPA said Tesla had failed to comply with air emissions standards for equipment leaks and management requirements for generators of hazardous wastes.\nTesla did not immediately comment.

TROISE and ALEX VEIGA Published April 01, 2019 Energy Associated Press\nFacebook Twitter Comments Print article\nStocks closed solidly higher on Wall Street Monday after a batch of encouraging global economic data kept investors in a buying mood.\nContinue Reading Below\nFinancial and technology companies powered much of the rally, which extended the market&apos;s gains from last week, when the benchmark S&P 500 closed out its best quarter in nearly a decade.\nIn another hopeful sign, long-term bond yields rose above their recent lows, following a sharp drop last month that flashed a possible recession warning, rattling Wall Street.\nThose concerns were allayed Monday as new economic data suggested a brighter outlook for the U.S. economy. A gauge of U.S. manufacturing notched a big gain in March, while a separate report showed construction spending climbed in February. Meanwhile, an economic report out of China showed growth in exports, employment and orders.\nWhile the more encouraging data gave stocks a boost, the market could face some bumps ahead, said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.\n\"The hurdle in the near-term is still going to be earnings,\" she said. \"That&apos;s the next important phase.\"\nAdvertisement\nThe S&P 500 gained 32.79 points, or 1.2%, to 2,867.19, notching a three-day winning streak.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 329.74 points, or 1.3%, to 26,258.42. The Nasdaq composite climbed 99.59 points, or 1.3%, to 7,828.91. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks picked up 16.33 points, for a 1.1% gain, to 1,556.06.\nMajor European stock indexes finished broadly higher.\nMonday&apos;s gains followed a strong finish to the first quarter for U.S. stocks. The S&P 500 index is now up 14.4% this year, a big turnaround after the index skidded 14 percent in the final quarter of 2018.\nFinancial and technology companies powered the latest rally. Investors tend to favor those sectors when they&apos;re confident the economy will continue growing. Bank of America gained 3.4% and Intel rose 1.5%.\nConsumer product makers and utility companies, which are considered safe-play investments, lagged the market. Clorox fell 1.2% and NRG Energy slid 1.7%.\nBond yields continued rising in another sign that investors are confident in the economy&apos;s growth. That came as a welcome relief following a sharp drop in bond yields to their lowest levels in more than a year.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose sharply, to 2.50% from 2.41% late Friday. It also rose back above the yield on the three-month Treasury bill.\nThe shift reverses an \"inversion\" in bond yields that alarmed investors last month because such a phenomenon, when it persists over time, has preceded recessions in the past.\nKey bond yields fell to their lowest levels in more than a year on March 22 and continued to slide much of last week after the Federal Reserve said it was seeing slower growth in the economy and no longer expected to raise interest rates this year.\n\"You look to the bond market to be a bit more skeptical and a bit ahead of the equity market on where things are going,\" said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager with Globalt Investments. \"So, the movement upward in the 10 year (yield) is a bounce that says &apos;OK, we realize there are these issues of a slowdown, but it&apos;s not a disaster.&apos;\"\nThe rise in bond yields helped boost bank stocks. Higher bond yields mean that banks can benefit from higher interest rates on loans. Shares in JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Capital One Financial each posted a 3.4% gain.\nWynn Resorts led all stocks in the S&P 500 as traders welcomed a solid revenue report from the casino operator&apos;s businesses in Macau and upbeat economic data from China. The stock jumped 8.4%.\nLyft plunged 11.9% on its second full day of trading, falling below its initial public offering price of $72 a share. The ride-hailing company has consistently lost money but has posted supercharged growth.\nIts IPO had been seen as a harbinger for other hotly anticipated offerings in fast-growing, privately held companies such as Uber, Pinterest and Slack.\nKellogg slid 2.4% on news the packaged foods company is selling its Keebler cookie brand and other sweet snacks businesses to Ferrero, an Italian confectionary company best known for making Nutella, for $1.3 billion.\nInvestors will be focusing more on corporate earnings this month, as the next big wave of company results kick into gear next week.\nWall Street expects a contraction in earnings during the first quarter, followed by slow growth for the remainder of 2019. Any company commentary about their prospects for the next few quarters will be important in giving analysts and investors a better picture of the economy.\nTraders also have their eye on the U.S.-Chinese trade negotiations, which are due to resume this week.

Biggs: I would support a temporary closure of the border Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., on President Trump's threat to close the U.S. border with Mexico.\nThe Department of Homeland Security said it is redeploying hundreds of Customs and Border Protection personnel to the U.S.-Mexico border in an emergency surge operation, as the president threatens to shut down the border entirely.\n\u201cThe crisis at our border is worsening, and DHS will do everything in its power to end it,\u201d DHS Secretary Nielsen said in a statement on Monday. \u201cWe will not stand idly by while Congress fails to act yet again, so all options are on the table.\u201d\nThe Trump administration repeated threats to close the border over the weekend, after the president cut aid to three Central American countries that he accused of deliberately sending migrants to the U.S.\nTrump said Friday that there was a \u201cvery good likelihood\u201d the border could be shut down this week, which is likely to have economic consequences for both economies.\nSimon Lester, associate director of the Cato Institute&apos;s Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, told FOX Business that since many industries \u2013 particularly the auto industry \u2013 are highly integrated between both countries, the impact on companies could be substantial.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cParts are produced in one country, and then transported to the other country for final assembly,\u201d Lester noted. \u201cShutting down the border will essentially shut down the production process for these companies, making it impossible for them to produce.\u201d\nDan Griswold of the Mercatus Center said in a statement that an average of 15,000 trucks and $1.6 billion worth of goods cross the southern border each day, meaning U.S. producers could \u201csuffer crippling disruptions of their supply chains,\u201d leading to a spike in consumer prices.\nIn 2018, the U.S. imported $346.5 billion worth of goods from Mexico, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau . Exports were valued at $265 billion during the same time period.\nCouncil of Economic Advisers chair Kevin Hassett told reporters on Monday that a border shutdown could impact the U.S. economy, though he said he would have to get back to them with specifics and modeling projections.\nThe number of border apprehensions in March exceeded 100,000 in March, while more than 76,000 individuals illegally crossed the border in February.

Another political disarray for the UK\u2019s departure from the EU.\nGBP/USD declies to1.3040 at the start of the Asian trading session on Tuesday. The Cable drops more than 60 pips after the UK secretary Stephen Barclay said no solution has won a majority in today's indicative voting on Brexit proposals. The GBP/USD pair earlier rose on expectations that the members of parliament (MPs) could break the current political deadlock.\nDespite the US Dollar\u2019s (USD) overall gains on receding recession fears due to upbeat ISM manufacturing data, the greenback failed to rise versus the British Pound (GBP) on Monday. The result being market speculations that the House of Commons will deliver a solution to Brexit deadlock after British lawmakers continue to reject PM May\u2019s proposal while fail to support any of the parliament\u2019s options in the first go.\nHowever, UK MPs pour cold water on those expectations as results came out before few minutes show none of the four Brexit proposals were welcomed by the parliament voters. While another failure to deliver any meaningful direction to the Brexit process highlights brighter chances of a no deal Brexit on April 12, the House is of view that they can still avoid that situation if they again vote on the PM May\u2019s deal on this week.\nWith the political event over, traders may now concentrate on the UK Markit construction PMI and the US Durable Goods Orders for further direction.\nThe UK Markit Construction purchasing managers\u2019 index is likely to strengthen to 49.8 from 49.5 but still remain in contraction region under 50 whereas the US durable goods order could slip to 1.8% from revised +0.3%. Also, non-defence capital goods orders ex-air crafts may have 0.0% growth during February.\nGBP/USD Technical Analysis\nThe GBP/USD pair couldn\u2019t hold its upside break to 50-day simple moving average (SMA) and is likely coming down towards 200-day SMA level of 1.2980 with 100-day SMA level of 1.2925 being following rest to watch.\nAlternatively, 1.3155/60 and 1.3210 can limit the quote\u2019s immediate upside ahead of 1.3280 and 1.3315 resistances.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

A total of 387 individual cases of measles have been confirmed in 15 states from January 1 to March 28, 2019. This is the second greatest number of cases reported in the US since measles was eliminated in 2000.\nA total of 387 individual cases of measles have been confirmed in 15 states from January 1 to March 28, 2019, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is the second-greatest number of cases reported in the United States since measles was eliminated in 2000. The highest number of reported cases since elimination was 667 in 2014.\nMeasles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus that can spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or if a person comes into direct contact or shares germs by touching the same objects or surfaces.\nThe states reporting cases are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Texas and Washington.\nThe CDC says six outbreaks \u2014 defined as three or more cases \u2014 are ongoing in California (Santa Cruz and Butte County), New Jersey, New York (Rockland County and New York City) and Washington.\nThese outbreaks are linked to travelers who brought measles back from other countries such as Israel, Ukraine and the Philippines, where large measles outbreaks are occurring.\nTypical measles symptoms, including high fever, rash all over the body, stuffy nose and reddened eyes, usually disappear without treatment within two or three weeks, though a severe case of the measles can lead to death.\nLast week, in an effort to contain an outbreak of measles that began in October, Rockland County, New York, banned unvaccinated people under age 18 from public places. As of Friday, the county reported 153 confirmed cases, though state health officials noted that additional cases have not been reported.\nLast year the CDC reported 372 total cases and 17 outbreaks, with three areas \u2014 New York, New York City, and New Jersey \u2014 contributing most of the cases. All three area outbreaks were linked to travelers bringing measles back from Israel and then spreading the virus among unvaccinated people in Orthodox Jewish communities.\nA total of 82 people brought measles into the nation from other countries in 2018. This is the greatest number of imported cases since measles was eliminated in the US.\nSince 1963, when the vaccine was introduced, cases and deaths from measles in the United States and other developed countries have plummeted. Prior to the vaccine, measles caused approximately 450 to 500 deaths each year in the United States.\nThe measles vaccine \u2014 known as the MMR vaccine \u2014 is very effective. One dose is about 93% effective at preventing measles if you come in contact with the virus. Two doses are about 97% effective. Experts recommend that children receive the vaccine in two doses, first, between ages 12 months and 15 months and then a second between 4 and 6 years old.\nWith any medicine, including vaccines, there is a chance of reactions, according to the CDC. These are usually mild and go away on their own, but there is a \u201cremote chance\u201d of the vaccine causing side effects and even serious injuries, according to the CDC.\nThis content was republished with permission from CNN .

Cresco stated that it will be the biggest acquisition of a public U.S. cannabis company ever. With such a major deal, you might think that Origin House shareholders would be on cloud nine. However, that wasn't the case. Origin House shares dropped 5% in early trading on Monday. Why wasn't there more excitement over the acquisition? Here are three things you need to know about this transaction that promises to shake up the U.S. cannabis industry. Two small white figurines pushing green jigsaw puzzle pieces together More Image source: Getty Images. 1. Terms of less-than-endearment Probably the main reason Origin House shareholders weren't overly enthusiastic about the acquisition is the price tag. The deal values Origin House shares at 12.68 in Canadian dollars, or around $9.50. That's only a 5% premium over Origin House's closing price on Friday, March 29, 2019. Origin House shareholders won't get any cash, either. Cresco Labs plans to acquire all outstanding shares of Origin House, with each Origin House shareholder receiving 0.8428 shares of Cresco Labs for each Origin House share owned. Cresco Labs has been a solid winner, jumping 35% in 2018 and up 68% so far this year. But Origin House has been even hotter, soaring 59% last year and 85% year to date in 2019. It was even the No. 2 best-performing marijuana stock on the market in March . Some Origin House investors might think that they're getting ownership in a Corvette when they owned a stake in a Ferrari. 2. The case for why the deal makes sense Size matters. If you're looking for the main reason why a combination of Cresco Labs and Origin House makes sense, that's it. Cresco Labs is already one of the largest cannabis operators in the U.S. Cresco claims a 28% market share in Illinois and a 30% market share in Pennsylvania. It's awaiting licensure in Michigan and closing of an acquisition in Florida. Once these transactions are finalized, Cresco will have operations in 11 states, including 15 production facilities, 21 operational retail dispensaries, and licenses for another 30 retail dispensaries. Origin House is the leading distributor of cannabis products in California, which has the largest legal marijuana market in the world. It has an expanding lineup of its own cannabis brands. The company is also poised to move into the Canadian recreational marijuana market in a major way with its acquisition of vape retailer 180 Smoke. Cresco Labs thinks that its acquisition of Origin House will create a \"North American cannabis powerhouse.\" CEO Charlie Bachtell said that the deal will give Cresco \"the largest and most strategic distribution footprint of any cannabis company in the United States.\" Origin House CEO Marc Lustig also sees a big advantage with the combination of the two companies. He stated, \"By partnering with one of the largest and most innovative U.S. multi-state operators in existence today, Origin House will supercharge its growth and be in a position to offer its brand partners access to 10 additional states, with licenses and supporting infrastructure already in place.\" 3. What it means for investors going forward The deal isn't done just yet. Both companies' boards of directors have unanimously approved the transaction. Cresco Labs' shareholders don't have to vote on the acquisition. However, a meeting will likely be held in June for Origin House shareholders to vote. Two-thirds of shares must be voted in favor of the deal for it to close, in addition to the normal regulatory approvals. Assuming the transaction does successfully close, Origin House shareholders will own around 20% of Cresco Labs. The big question then will be: Now what? It could be smart for investors to hold on for the ride. Cresco Labs projects pro forma combined revenue with Origin House in its fold this year of $383 million. By 2021, the company expects revenue of $1.04 billion and EBITDA of $317 million. And that's probably just the beginning. The U.S. marijuana market is expected to grow dramatically over the next several years, with some projecting a market of $22 billion by 2022 . There's also a multibillion-dollar hemp opportunity thanks to the legalization of hemp in the U.S. in December 2018. In February, Cresco Labs launched a subsidiary to target the hemp cannabidiol (CBD) market. If the acquisition of Origin House by Cresco Labs goes through, Cresco appears likely to become the sixth-largest cannabis operator by market cap. Although there seems to be some degree of disappointment for Origin House investors, the combined entity could be just what the two companies hope it will be -- a North American cannabis powerhouse.

The workplace messaging provider has selected the NYSE for its direct listing, according to a Wall Street Journal report Monday citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. This makes Slack the latest in a slew of tech unicorns \u2013 or companies with private valuations north of $1 billion \u2013 to select the NYSE for a highly anticipated upcoming stock listing. Uber and Pinterest have also selected the NYSE for their initial public offerings, according to multiple reports . Lyft ( LYFT ), which saw shares begin trading Friday, selected the Nasdaq. Slack declined to comment on the report. In February, the San Francisco, California-based company announced that it had confidentially filed to go public and offer shares of its Class A common stock. In a direct listing, a company avoids using underwriters and instead sells shares directly to the public. The process allows companies to avoid a lock-up period on selling shares, and also does not involve a pre-public capital raise for the company, as with a typical IPO. Slack is still working with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding listing logistics and is not expected to go public until at least June or July, the WSJ report added. This comes following Spotify\u2019s ( SPOT ) decision to debut on the NYSE via direct listing last year. Spotify\u2019s market capitalization has now topped $25 billion, and shares have risen 6% since hitting the public markets last April. Slack was last valued privately at more than $7 billion. \u2014 Follow Yahoo Finance on Twitter , Facebook , Instagram , Flipboard , LinkedIn , and reddit .

In the footage, taken in Anchorage in the US state of Alaska, what looks like two plumes of black smoke are seen trailing a mysterious object.\nA variety of military aircraft operate out of the nearby Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, but spokeswoman Erin Eaton said the sighting was nothing to do with them.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t look like any of our planes,\u201d she said. Officials from the Federal Aviation Administration added that the object in the video was not an aircraft, and that it hadn\u2019t received any reports of aviation issues at the time.\nBut some experts still think a plane is the likeliest explanation. Peter Davidson, director of the Washington-based National UFO Reporting Center, said that the video showed \u201ca high-altitude jet airliner, with a contrail behind it, t is in level flight, but because it is flying away from the camera, it appears to be \u2018falling\u2019 he wrote.\nAdonus Baugh, who shot the video, was not convinced. The 18-year-old said the object looked like something coming into the atmosphere.\n\u201cMe and my mom were just coming in to the parking lot of our house and that\u2019s when I noticed that something was falling from the sky,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI thought it was a meteor or something coming into the atmosphere. \u201cI actually never saw something like this before.\u201d\nAnother witness, Bebe Kang, agreed. \u201cIt didn\u2019t look like an airplane or one of those jets. It was big, super slow and red,\u201d said Bebe.\nWhose is the right explanation remains a mystery.\n Source https://ufosightingshotspot.blogspot.com/\nSupport BeforeItsNews by trying APeX (far superior to colloidal silver) or any of our other great health products at www.mitocopper.com\nEMF Blocking Smart Meter Cover Smart Meter Dangers and a Solution !", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://ufosightingshotspot.blogspot.com/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/WGils9jgezo", "https://mitocopper.com/products/apex-direct-oxygen-infusion-protocol?afmc=6l&utm_campaign=6l&utm_source=leaddyno&utm_medium=affiliate", "https://5starshine.com/collections/cool-stuff/products/emf-blocking-smart-meter-cover?afmc=9a&utm_campaign=9a&utm_source=leaddyno&utm_medium=affiliate", "https://www.mitocopper.com/?afmc=63&utm_campaign=63&utm_source=leaddyno&utm_medium=affiliate", "https://mitocopper.com/collections/frontpage/products/apex-direct-oxygen-infusion-protocol?afmc=8q&utm_campaign=8q&utm_source=leaddyno&utm_medium=affiliate"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "adonus baugh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter davidson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erin eaton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "paranormal air", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "us air force", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "federal aviation administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national ufo reporting center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alaska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anchorage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T00:48:20.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5445116299f5013171ef174180017e37e76d7101", "url": "https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/us-transfers-six-more-patrol-boats-to-vietnam-coast-guards-3903157.html", "site_full": "e.vnexpress.net", "site": "vnexpress.net", "site_section": "https://vnexpress.net/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "VnExpress -

A look at the shareholders of Energy One Limited ( ASX:EOL ) can tell us which group is most powerful. Generally speaking, as a company grows, institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely, insiders often decrease their ownership over time. Warren Buffett said that he likes 'a business with enduring competitive advantages that is run by able and owner-oriented people'. So it's nice to see some insider ownership, because it may suggest that management is owner-oriented. Energy One is a smaller company with a market capitalization of AU$33m, so it may still be flying under the radar of many institutional investors. Our analysis of the ownership of the company, below, shows that institutions are not on the share registry. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholder can tell us about EOL. More What Does The Lack Of Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Energy One? Institutional investors often avoid companies that are too small, too illiquid or too risky for their tastes. But it's unusual to see larger companies without any institutional investors. There are multiple explanations for why institutions don't own a stock. The most common is that the company is too small relative to fund under management, so the institition does not bother to look closely at the company. On the other hand, it's always possible that professional investors are avoiding a company because they don't think it's the best place for their money. Energy One's earnings and revenue track record (below) may not be compelling to institutional investors -- or they simply might not have looked at the business closely. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Energy One. There is some analyst coverage of the stock, but it could still become more well known, with time. Insider Ownership Of Energy One The definition of company insiders can be subjective, and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own the majority of Energy One Limited. This means they can collectively make decisions for the company. Given it has a market cap of AU$33m, that means they have AU$24m worth of shares. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public Ownership The general public, with a 15% stake in the company, will not easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. Private Company Ownership We can see that Private Companies own 12%, of the shares on issue. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company. Next Steps: It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Energy One better, we need to consider many other factors. Many find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past.

In recent years, it\u2019s targeted Syrian territory numerous times, flagrantly violating international law.\nOn Monday, Sergey Lavrov said \u201c(o)ur military specialists have visited (the alleged) place (attacked), and they did not find any trace of chlorine or any other chemical substance used against civilians\u201d \u2013 nothing supporting the official narrative, clearly a bald-faced lie, Washington and Israel surely behind it.\nSyrian Arab Red Crescent medical personnel and doctors in Douma explained no one was treated for toxic agent poisoning.\nAl-Qaeda-connected White Helmets published images online, claiming to show the aftermath of a Douma CW attack \u2013 their operatives wearing no protective clothing, essential if protection from toxic agents was needed.\nAlleged images of suffocating babies in diapers breathing through oxygen masks were fake \u2013 perhaps from somewhere else earlier, clearly not from Douma.\nSputnik News said they \u201cappeared to be so focused on accusing President Bashar al-Assad of dropping a chemical bomb on Douma that they forgot to put on gas masks or protective suits themselves\u201d \u2013 appearing calm and unharmed in an image shown.\nOn Monday \u201cMad dog\u201d Mattis suggested a US military response could be coming, refusing to \u201crule out anything right now,\u201d adding:\n\u201cThe first thing we have to look at is why chemical weapons are still being used at all.

What Washington and its rogue partners intend doing should unfold in the hours or days following Monday\u2019s Security meeting on the issue.\nNote: On Monday, Trump said he\u2019ll decide in the next 24 \u2013 48 hours whether to strike Syria militarily.\nSurrounded by neocon lunatics, the damn fool in the White House risks starting global war.\nThe post US Confirms Israeli Warplanes Struck Syrian Airbase appeared first on The Sleuth Journal .\nSource: http://www.thesleuthjournal.com/israeli-warplanes-struck-syrian-airbase/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.thesleuthjournal.com", "http://www.thesleuthjournal.com/israeli-warplanes-struck-syrian-airbase/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sergey lavrov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douma", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nbc news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "douma cw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syrian arab red crescent", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T00:53:11.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0edafeac84190bcc5eed4da730ef05c4f3d34948", "url": "https://beforeitsnews.com/v3/alternative/2019/3673830.html", "site_full": "beforeitsnews.com", "site": "beforeitsnews.com", "site_section": "https://beforeitsnews.com/v3/list/v2_top_money.html", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Money | Featured List", "title": "US Military Places HUGE Gas Mask Order: What Do They Know That We Don\u2019t!?! | Alternative", "title_full": "US Military Places HUGE Gas Mask Order: What Do They Know That We Don\u2019t!?! | Alternative", "published": "2019-04-02T01:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://justusaknight.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-01-at-6.43.57-am.png?w=600&h=280&crop=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6659, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0edafeac84190bcc5eed4da730ef05c4f3d34948", "url": "https://beforeitsnews.com/v3/alternative/2019/3673830.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "beforeitsnews.com", "published": "2019-04-02T01:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "US Military Places HUGE Gas Mask Order: What Do They Know That We Don\u2019t!?! | Alternative", "text": "What happens when the U.S. places a large order for Gas Masks immediately after a report comes out on the \u2018emerging threat\u2019 of bio-warfare?!?

Sources familiar with the F-35\u2019s intricate worldwide production process and U.S. thinking on the issue last week said Turkey\u2019s role can be replaced.\nThe United States and other NATO allies that own F-35s fear the radar on the Russian S-400 missile system will learn how to spot and track the jet, making it less able to evade Russian weapons in the future.\nIn an attempt to persuade Turkey to drop its plans to buy the S-400, the United States offered the pricier American-made Patriot anti-missile system in a discounted deal that expired at the end of March. Turkey has shown interest in the Patriot system, but not at the expense of abandoning the S-400.\nTurkey has engaged with U.S. negotiators in recent days about buying the Patriot system, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The system is made by Raytheon Co.\nTurkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar in March said that despite some issues, Turkish pilots were continuing their training at an air base in Arizona on the F-35, each of which costs $90 million, and that Ankara was expecting the aircraft to arrive in Turkey in November.\nU.S. lawmakers also have expressed alarm over Turkey\u2019s planned purchase of the Russian system. Four U.S. senators last week introduced a bipartisan bill that would prohibit the transfer of F-35s to Turkey until the U.S. government certifies that Ankara will not take delivery of the S-400 system. \u0394\u03b5\u03af\u03c4\u03b5 \u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name":

Argentina Moves Again to Bolster the World's Weakest Currency (Bloomberg) -- Argentina\u2019s central bank said it won\u2019t allow its key interest rate to drop below 62.5 percent in April, buttressing its campaign to protect the peso.\nThe commitment comes on top of the central bank\u2019s pledge to freeze the monetary supply until the end of the year to cool inflation, part of a record $56 billion credit agreement with the International Monetary Fund. The peso gained as much as 1.5 percent to 42.70 per dollar on Monday, tracking gains in other emerging markets.\nThe latest step comes after a renewed slump in the peso pushed it to a record low on March 27, threatening to fuel an inflation rate that stood at 51 percent in February. Price-growth has proved stubbornly high after the bank eased policy this year, allowing the key rate, known as Leliq, to fall below 60 percent throughout January and February. The rate now stands at 68.2 percent, the highest in the world.\n\"Perseverance in the strict control of the evolution of the monetary base will lead to a reduction in inflation in upcoming months,\" the bank said in a statement after a meeting of its monetary policy committee.\nAll the same, the central bank expects inflation to remain elevated in March and April, based on high-frequency data it monitors.\nToday\u2019s announcement is the latest twist in the past year for the bank, which has had three presidents and a complete policy overhaul on top of the IMF bailout. It pulled out emergency measures last year to handle Argentina\u2019s currency crisis and recession. The peso lost more than half its value against the dollar and the economy fell into recession as investor concern about the nation\u2019s deficits helped spark the peso\u2019s plunge.\nThe government and IMF have long forecast that the economy will start to rebound in the second quarter of this year, backed by Argentina\u2019s soy harvest and exports. Some analysts say a rebound can\u2019t take place with rates and inflation this high. Economic activity barely rose in January compared with December, and fell 5.7 percent from a year ago, according to data published last week.\nFighting inflation while implementing austerity measures is challenging President Mauricio Macri\u2019s bid for re-election this year. His approval ratings declined to 30 percent in March. Argentines will cast their vote on Oct. 27, with a potential runoff vote between the two top candidates set for Nov. 24.\nMeasures the bank took last month included:\nTargeting an additional 10 percent reduction in the monetary base Extending its target for zero growth in the monetary base until December Adjusting its currency band 1.75 percent a month, compared with 2 percent Reducing the amount of dollars the central bank can buy if the peso falls below the currency band floor to $50 million a day from $75 million Expanding the limit Leliq banks can hold (Adds background on central bank in 6th-8th paragraphs.)\nArgentina Moves Again to Bolster the World's Weakest Currency", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://invst.ly/afnep", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fin.investing.com%2Fnews%2Fforex-news%2Fargentina-moves-again-to-bolster-the-worlds-weakest-currency-1517509&title=Argentina+Moves+Again+to+Bolster+the+World%27s+Weakest+Currency&summary=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=179222828858436&u=https%3A%2F%2Fin.investing.com%2Fnews%2Fforex-news%2Fargentina-moves-again-to-bolster-the-worlds-weakest-currency-1517509&display=popup&ref=plugin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "leliq", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg \u00a9 reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "international monetary fund", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "argentina", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T01:05:20.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dacbf0c1379e9a96e9568df62238cf04fa16c6bb", "url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-naked-protest-climate-change-withdrawal-agreement-nick-boles-house-of-commons-theresa-may-a8850136.html", "site_full": "www.independent.co.uk", "site": "independent.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.independent.co.uk/", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "The Independent | News | UK and Worldwide News | Newspaper", "title": "The nudists in the Commons spoke for all of us, turning their backsides towards the whole sorry spectacle", "title_full": "The nudists in the Commons spoke for all of us, turning their backsides towards the whole sorry spectacle | The Independent", "published": "2019-04-02T00:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.1, "main_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/04/01/18/d3fofwaxgailmct.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 568, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 634, "comments": 128, "shares": 175}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dacbf0c1379e9a96e9568df62238cf04fa16c6bb", "url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-naked-protest-climate-change-withdrawal-agreement-nick-boles-house-of-commons-theresa-may-a8850136.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "independent.co.uk", "published": "2019-04-02T00:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "The nudists in the Commons spoke for all of us, turning their backsides towards the whole sorry spectacle", "text": "It is a measure of how far we have travelled that the sudden, silent pressing of 22 naked buttocks against the window of the public gallery of the House of Commons felt like a moment of serenity.The first reactions to this scene, unfolding in slow motion above the Commons chamber, were almost quizzical. Ed Miliband appeared to do no more than raise an eyebrow, to acknowledge the increasingly unignorable reality that, here in the heart of the mother of parliaments, at this defining hour of history, were 11 naked men and women, each with their backsides mashed on to the glass, a flat panorama of squashed humanity, marked with unreadable protest slogans and vanishing undercrackers.It was the silence that did it, the eerie calm. No noise penetrates that glass, so even the wildest of commotions unfold like those climactic movie scenes in which heroes perish in slow motion beneath the sound of soft strings. It almost felt like it was happening underwater, their sheer pink flesh appearing suddenly from nowhere, like a family of giant turtles before a startled scuba diver, gliding serenely towards the shimmering sunlight.From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.At the moment it began, a Labour MP called Peter Kyle had been muttering something about the customs union. Or was it the single market? It might have been the backstop. Who even cares any more? Nothing of any interest whatsoever has been uttered in that chamber for at least two years. There is nothing left unsaid, no angle unworked, no debating point that has not been sanded away to nothing by Brexit \u2019s dreary tides. There was a gentle commotion, eventually. Members did their best to carry on as normal. Mike Gapes interrupted to make a point of order. Something to do with the 2016 referendum being advisory, I think. If it wasn\u2019t that, it can only have been another one of the approximately nine salient points about Brexit that have been repeated, ad infinitum, for three long dismal years.They were a work of art, up there, the Flat Arse society. This was humanity, turning its soft, inscrutable face towards its torturer, begging to be noticed, begging to be saved. Quite literally, in fact. The protest had nothing at all to do with Brexit.

Typically, consumers hold off on buying durable goods during poor economy conditions; thus, improved orders suggest confidence among American consumers with respect to their future financial security. The preliminary March print is expected to show a drop of - 1.2 % over the prior month after the 0.3 % increase in February .\nThe data may dent the rebound in US growth expectations seen in recent weeks. Based on the data received thus far about Q 1 \u20191 9 , the Atlanta Fed GDPNow forecast is looking for growth at 2.1 % after hitting a low of 0.2% in the second week of March . The next update to the Q 1 \u20191 9 forecast will be released after Tuesday\u2019s US economic data.\nPairs to Watch: DXY Index, EURUSD , USDJPY , Gold USDJPY Price Chart: Daily Timeframe (December 2018 to April 2019)\nThe break of the uptrend from the post-Yen flash crash low found little follow through to the downside last week, bottoming out on March 25 at 109.71. Since then, price action has been constructive, and now the downtrend from the March swing highs is under pressure. A break higher out of the downtrend would eye the March 20 bearish outside engulfing bar high at 111.69; a break down through the low at 110.80, established by the gap open at the start of the week, would suggest losses could accelerate back towards the March low.\nRead more : Top 5 Events: April RBA Meeting & AUDUSD Price Outlook FX TRADING RESOURCES\nWhether you are a new or experienced trader, DailyFX has multiple resources available to help you: an indicator for monitoring trader sentiment ; quarterly trading forecasts ; analytical and educational webinars held daily ; trading guides to help you improve trading performance , and even one for those who are new to FX trading .\n--- Written by Christopher Vecchio, CFA, Senior Currency Strategist\nTo contact Christopher, email him at\nFollow him in the DailyFX Real Time News feed and Twitter at @CVecchioFX\nDailyFX provides forex news and technical analysis on the trends that influence the global currency markets.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CVecchioFX"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christopher vecchio", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "christopher vecchio christopher vecchio", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "us durable goods & usdjpy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fx week ahead", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta fed", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T01:06:22.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4deffc2cf6e40557e0b065a5fc0576bad3ce3e7c", "url": "https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/04/01/currency-volatility-rba-could-jolt-audusd-price-action.html", "site_full": "www.dailyfx.com", "site": "dailyfx.com", "site_section": "https://rss.dailyfx.com/feeds/all", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "DailyFX - Feeds all", "title": "Currency Volatility: RBA Could Jolt AUDUSD Price Action", "title_full": "Currency Volatility: RBA Could Jolt AUDUSD Price Action", "published": "2019-04-02T00:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9130, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4deffc2cf6e40557e0b065a5fc0576bad3ce3e7c", "url": "https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/04/01/currency-volatility-rba-could-jolt-audusd-price-action.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rich Dvorak, Junior Analyst", "published": "2019-04-02T00:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Currency Volatility: RBA Could Jolt AUDUSD Price Action", "text": "by Rich Dvorak , Junior Analyst Macroeconomic trends, technical analysis and capital market alerts.

Back AUDUSD IMPLIED VOLATILITY \u2013 TALKING POINTS AUDUSD overnight implied volatility skyrockets to 10.7 percent in anticipation of the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s rate review expected Tuesday at 3:00 GMT Although markets are largely expecting the RBA to keep interest rates on hold at 1.50 percent, Governor Philip Lowe could provide supplemental information on the central bank\u2019s latest view on monetary policy and economic outlook New to Forex? Check out this free Forex for Beginners educational trading guide\nForex option traders have bid up implied volatility on overnight AUDUSD contracts ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s latest monetary policy decision slated for Tuesday at 3:00 GMT. While the central bank is widely expected to stay on the sidelines and leave its policy interest rate unchanged at 1.50 percent, follow-up commentary from Governor Lowe looks to provide AUD traders with additional insight on the RBA\u2019s next move. FOREX MARKET IMPLIED VOLATILITIES AND TRADING RANGES\nThe accompanying monetary policy decision statement will likely highlight the latest developments in Australia\u2019s labor and housing markets which largely contribute to the central bank\u2019s relative dovish or hawkish tilt. Despite the Australian unemployment rate recently dropping to 4.9 percent, its lowest reading since June 2011, the RBA could still refrain from taking a less-dovish stance in consideration of neighboring New Zealand whose central bank hinted at cutting the country's policy interest rate last week. AUDUSD CURRENCY PRICE CHART: 4-HOUR TIME FRAME (MARCH 05, 2019 TO APRIL 01, 2019)\nAUDUSD spot prices have recently traded between the 23.6 percent and 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement lines drawn from March\u2019s low and high. Although, the currency pair appears to have coiled between short-term trendlines which could position AUDUSD for a material break above downtrend resistance or below uptrend support. According to overnight implied volatility measures, however, currency market participants could expect AUDUSD to trade between 0.7076 and 0.7156. FOREX ECONOMIC CALENDAR \u2013 AUDUSD\nVisit the DailyFX Economic Calendar for a comprehensive list of upcoming economic events and data releases affecting the global markets.\nIn addition to the RBA\u2019s rate review, a handful of economic data out of Australia and the US could exacerbate AUDUSD price volatility. The latest reading on US Durable Goods Orders could move the market\u2019s needle if actual data crosses the wires materially above or below consensus. Also, AiG\u2019s Performance of Services Index has potential to send AUDUSD gyrating later in Tuesday\u2019s session depending on the reading. AUDUSD CLIENT SENTIMENT\nCheck out IG\u2019s Client Sentiment here for more detail on the bullish and bearish biases of EURUSD , GBPUSD , USDJPY , Gold , Bitcoin and S&P500 .\nAccording to IG\u2019s client positioning data, 61.3 percent of AUDUSD traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 1.59 to 1. Moreover, traders have grown increasing bullish AUDUSD as the number of traders net-long is 11.4 percent higher than Friday and 26.9 percent higher compared to last week. However, we typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment which suggests AUDUSD prices may continue to fall.\n- Written by Rich Dvorak , Junior Analyst for DailyFX\n- Follow @RichDvorakFX on Twitter", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/RichDvorakFX"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rich dvorak", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lowe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philip lowe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rba", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reserve bank of australia", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T01:06:35.039+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "683bc4e162cecec3e21ce3954c008e218ef513eb", "url": "https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/video/live_events/2019/04/01/gold-and-silver-prices-near-support-usdjpy-eyes-new-highs-JWweb-101.html", "site_full": "www.dailyfx.com", "site": "dailyfx.com", "site_section": "https://rss.dailyfx.com/feeds/all", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "DailyFX - Feeds all", "title": "Gold Prices Fall Towards Target While USD/JPY Works Higher", "title_full": "Gold Prices Fall Towards Target While USD/JPY Works Higher", "published": "2019-04-02T00:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9130, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "683bc4e162cecec3e21ce3954c008e218ef513eb", "url": "https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/video/live_events/2019/04/01/gold-and-silver-prices-near-support-usdjpy-eyes-new-highs-JWweb-101.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jeremy Wagner, CEWA-M, Head Forex Trading Instructor", "published": "2019-04-02T00:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "Gold Prices Fall Towards Target While USD/JPY Works Higher", "text": "by Jeremy Wagner, CEWA-M , Head Forex Trading Instructor Swing trading, chart patterns, breakouts, and Elliott wave.

USDJPY Elliott wave pattern is longer term bullish.\nThe video above is a recording of a US Opening Bell webinar from April 1, 2019. We focused on the Elliott Wave patterns for key markets such as gold, silver, crude oil , DXY , EURUSD , NZDUSD , and USDJPY. Gold prices approach wave relationships\nIn last week\u2019s webinar, we highlighted how the gold price chart is showing many symptoms of a near term bearish reversal . Since last week, gold prices have fallen nearly 2.5% holding to the bearish forecast.\nIt is anticipated that gold would hold below Monday\u2019s high of $1325 with some targets and wave relationships appearing below $1250. What this means is that if gold prices continue to fall below $1250, we will look for signs of a longer-term bottom forming.\nThough not expected, if gold prices do run higher above $1325 before dropping below $1250, then we will need to reassess the forecast and reconsider if the multi-year Elliott wave triangle has finished and found a low.\nTherefore, we are showing the current Elliott wave for gold to be wave \u2018c\u2019 ( zigzag ) of wave E of a triangle. We are counting the triangle as a larger wave (X) which began in July 2016.\nRead more\u2026\nTop gold trading strategies and tips Silver prices in a similar Elliott wave pattern as gold prices\nSilver price forecast is similar to gold in that we are looking for continued weakness to be temporary. We believe silver is in the \u2018c\u2019 wave of a zigzag pattern . Once this \u2018c\u2019 wave exhausts, we will anticipate a large rally to $17 and possibly $19 that may take many months to complete.\nUsing Elliott wave relationships, we forecast this current \u2018c\u2019 wave to fall towards 14.40-14.80. From there, we are anticipating a rally to above 16.20 and possibly to 17.00 while holding above 13.89.\nRead more\u2026\nTrading the gold-silver ratio: strategies and tips NZD/USD Breaks Temporary Key Level\nIn last week\u2019s webinar we followed up to our analyst pick from two week\u2019s ago how the Elliott wave triangle pattern may have finalized . We outlined a forecast that stated \u201cif NZDUSD were to unexpectedly fall below .6814, then some other wave pattern is at play.\u201d\nWell, NZDUSD did fall below .6814. Therefore, it appears the Kiwi may still be consolidating inside the triangle with another complex wave. The bullish forecast is essentially delayed on a temporary basis with prices holding above .6720. Below .6720 and more options are added back for consideration. USDJPY falls but longer term bullish pattern remains\nThe multi-year bullish forecast yielded on January 3 remains in place despite the recent correction for USDJPY. Last week\u2019s dip to 109.70 did meet some wave relationships. It is possible that after a brief rally to near 112, USDJPY may turn lower to retest 109.70 as the depth of the March 5 correction is a little short.\nWe are uncertain of the odds of a retest, but do believe that after the correction is over, a large rally may ensue as USDJPY wave be in a third wave of an impulsive wave sequence. Third waves tend to be the longest and strongest of the Elliott wave sequence. If correct, then wave 3 would break to new highs above 112 that may work up towards 117-122. Elliott Wave Theory FAQ\nHow does Elliott Wave theory work?\nElliott Wave theory is a trading study that identifies the highs and lows of price movements on charts via wave patterns. Traders analyze the waves for 5-wave moves and 3-wave corrections to determine where the market is at within the larger pattern. Additionally, the theory maintains three rules and several guidelines on the depth of the waves related to one another. Therefore, it is common to use Fibonacci with Elliott Wave analysis. We cover these topics in our beginners and advanced Elliott Wave trading guides.\nAfter reviewing the guides above , be sure to follow future Elliott Wave articles to see Elliott Wave Theory in action.\nNot sure if Elliott wave is right for you? Believe it or not, when I first started trading I couldn\u2019t understand why technical analysis worked. Now, I\u2019m 100% technical through Elliott wave.

Lam Research derives close to 15% revenue from Micron, while Micron incurs about 14% cost with Lam Research (Table 1). Their closely intertwined supply chain relationship provides a unique source of information for both companies' financial forecast and stock valuation. It is the purpose of this post to decide the direction of the information causality between the two companies. The practical implication of the conclusion will suggest whether Micron investors can use LRCX's financial information in valuing their stock or the other way around.\nMicron vs. Lam Research For the most part, Micron and Lam Research share the same outlook and destiny. LRCX's 2Q financials guide a weaker 3Q mainly from a continued weaker DRAM/NAND flash memory prices from their chip customers, such as Micron. Chip firm's recovery in investment in semiconductor-production equipment is a must for Lam's improving outlook. Although, most chip companies look to continue to reduce their capital expenditure in the near term. In its own right, Lam still has to face another weaker logic chips and foundry demand due to China slowdown from trade uncertainty. Although this revenue segment is expected to recover sooner in 1H 2019, it is yet to fully offset the softness in the chip demand. LRCX's management guided a 5% sequential decline in 3Q revenue.\nSimilarly, aided by management optimism and investors' lowered expectations, Micron post-2Q prices rally even with a weaker 3Q guidance. Micron has been cutting supply, reducing capital expenditure, and buying back stock. It is expected that China uncertainty and DRAM price especially will improve in 2H 2019, per management optimism. Micron's positive near-term outlook may be the basis for the LRCX's recent upward EPS revision.\nMicron's Demand and Lam Research's Supply LRCX sources the largest revenue from Micron. The sheer size suggests that LRCX's revenue growth will directly reflect the world demand on Micron's memory chips. Micron also incurs 13.93% of their cost of goods sold from LRCX, which makes LRCX the largest Micron supplier. Probably, the more plausible argument for the direction of supply chain may be described as follows: As Micron always has the most current information on its global product demand as well as the current inventory when Micron foresees changes, they will adjust new orders to the suppliers accordingly. As a result, LRCX's monthly revenue has to be the first place to reflect such changes. Through this link, LRCX's revenue is bound to correlate with Micron revenue growth over time, as shown by the close co-movement between LRCX's revenue and Micron's revenue (Figure 1). This is why LRCX's future revenue growth is an important indicator of Micron's future revenue growth. On average, for every $1 billion change in LRCX revenue, Micron's revenue will change by $2.15 billion.\nIn the past, there has been a causal relationship from LRCX revenue to Micron's revenue, as LRCX represents 13.93% of the cost of goods sold. In Figure 1A, it appears that LRCX revenue estimate led Micron revenue estimate, as indicated by the rise and fall of LRCX revenue (points A-C) often preceded the rise and fall of Micron revenue. The relationship may be due to the fact that LRCX's revenue change equates to Micron's cost change, which reflects the world demand change for Micron's product. The lead-lag relationship seems to work at both the top and the bottom of the revenue cycle. Roughly, there is a 2-3 month lead for LRCX revenue to rise or fall before Micron does. The same pattern of LRCX's EPS estimate leading Micron's EPS estimate can be observed in Figure 1B from the mapping of Point A through Point D. As both Micron and LRCX's forward financials exhibited a declining trend, it is interesting that LRCX's forward EPS indicates a mild uptick at Point E most recently, which has not been followed through by Micron's estimate revision.\nIt should be noted that such a repetitive lead-lag relationship is very difficult to obtain and thus extremely valuable. This is the beauty of a stable supply chain which can be used to predict the \"lager's\" (Micron's) future financials. For example, LRCX's revenue tends to rise 2 months before Micron's quarter revenue's rise. The same lead applies to the revenue decrease. In other words, Micron's revenue will only rise or fall two months after LRCX's changes. If this pattern is stable enough, it will provide a reasonable base for forecasting Micron's 1H 2019 revenue. Since LRCX's March 2019 revenue didn't change, its EPS estimate had a mild increase, this could be a possible sign of a better 2H 2019 for Micron.\nCaution For investors looking for early signals of future growth, caution should be taken in interpreting the seemingly obvious \"leading indicators\" which can be simply false signals. Clearly, LRCX has many other customers, so its forward financials change can be easily triggered by event risk of any one of those other customers. On the other hand, if the largest LRCX's tech customer Micron has been consistently and repetitively exhibiting a similar 2-month lagging pattern, I am fairly confident in the validity of the predictive power of the pattern.\nLRCX Financials Are More Important to Micron Further, since this (leading) relationship has been historically repetitive and can be easily reasoned through, any reasonable investors should also expect that the pattern may have been baked into the stock prices. Thus, is there any remaining value for this information for investors? For this question, I compared Micron's stock prices with LRCX's revenue and Micron's revenue estimates. The comparison is intended to see whether Micron's stock prices reflected the leading information in the LRCX revenue estimate and if there is any information left in the Micron's own revenue estimates. From Figure 3 and Figure 4, the answers are yes and yes. Yes! Micron's stock prices correlated more with LRCX's revenue (0.83) than with Micron's own revenue estimates (0.43). Yes! The Micron's own consensus revenue estimates, albeit lagging, still contain additional new information to affect Micron stock prices, as shown by a statistically significant correlation of 0.43. The result is both encouraging and interesting. It is encouraging because investors have incorporated the relevant information in the company's supply chain. It is also interesting that Micron's stock price is more responsive to its supplier LRCX's financials than its own financials, especially in the more recent period (circles in Figure 3 and Figure 4).\nTakeaways Using a company's supply chain, company stock prices are affected by their major suppliers' financials, especially if they are the largest supplier. In the case of Micron which has a large supply chain, its largest supplier LRCX's forward financials provide leading information regarding Micron's forward financials. Using this information, Micron's stock may be better valued.\nWhile the evidence in this post confirms my claim that stock prices move with its supplier's financial forecast more than with the company's own financial forecast, one practical question is that whether the current stock prices fully price in the information content in LRCX's monthly revenue. For that, I correlated the Micron's stock price with Micron's own quarterly revenue estimate as well as LRCX's monthly revenue. Using this approach, I was able to estimate Micron's current revenue-driven fair value at $42.7 compared to the actual price at $39.23 (3/27/2019).

Col. Mike Andrews told CNN in a statement. \"We very much regret the current situation facing our F-35 partnership, but the DoD is taking prudent steps to protect the shared investments made in our critical technology,\" he added. The news of the delivery suspension was first reported by Reuters. The announcement comes as the Turkish Foreign Minister heads to Washington for a ministerial meeting marking the 70th anniversary of NATO. Read More Pentagon warns of 'grave consequences' for Turkey if it purchases Russian missile system \"The US continues to warn Turkey of the negative consequences of its announced procurement of the S-400. We have, however, been clear that the acquisition of the S-400 is not compatible with the F-35 and Turkey's continued participation in the F-35 program is at risk,\" Andrews said. Turkey has been involved with the F-35 development for a long time but senior US military and defense officials have long warned Turkey about the consequences of its pursuit of the Russian-made system, saying it was not compatible with NATO systems and posed an intelligence risk to the aircraft. \"While we continue the dialogue with our Turkish counter-parts, the DoD has initiated steps necessary to ensure prudent program planning and resiliency of the F-35 supply chain, as a result, secondary sources of supply for Turkish-produced parts are in development,\" Andrews said. Members of Congress have also sought to block Turkey's receipt of the jet amid the deteriorating relationship between Washington and Ankara over a range of issues. Turkish pilots are currently training with the F-35 jets at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. Several Turkish companies have contributed to the development of the F-35 through work on the Lockheed Martin built airframe and the Pratt and Whitney propulsion system. Turkish firms were also to have a role in the maintenance of the jets. As a program partner, Turkish industries \"are eligible to become suppliers to the global F-35 fleet for the life of the program,\" according to information posted by Lockheed Martin, the jet's manufacturer. The company says Turkey plans to purchase \"100 of the F-35A Conventional Takeoff and Landing variant.\" Twelve countries participate in the F-35 program. The nine partner nations that participated in the plane's development include the US, Turkey, UK, Italy, Netherlands, Canada, Australia, Denmark and Norway. All of these countries except for Canada, Denmark and Turkey are already receiving deliveries of the F-35. Israel, Japan and South Korea also have received the jets through foreign military sales. A US defense official previously told CNN that a major concern is that the S-400, particularly if it's plugged into Turkey's integrated air defense system, could gather technical data on the F-35's capabilities and that critical information could be passed to Moscow either intentionally or unintentionally through a back door in the Russian-designed system. \"This issue, the S-400, is a tough issue. And we're having a hard time,\" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford said last month at an event at the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC. \"I think both the executive branch of our government, the legislative branch of our government are going to have a hard time reconciling the presence of the S-400 and the most advanced fighter aircraft that we have, the F-35,\" he said, adding \"our position has been made very clear to Turkey.\" \"We're hopeful that we can find a way through this.
