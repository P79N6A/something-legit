The United States said Monday it was halting all deliveries and joint work with Turkey on the F-35 fighter jet program after the NATO ally insisted on a major purchase from Russia.After months of warnings, the United States said that Turkey\u2019s decision to buy Russia\u2019s S-400 system was incompatible with remaining part of the emblematic US warplane program.\u201cPending an unequivocal Turkish decision to forgo delivery of the S-400, deliveries and activities associated with the stand-up of Turkey\u2019s F-35 operational capability have been suspended while our dialogue on this important matter continues with Turkey,\u201d the Pentagon said in a statement.US officials have voiced concern that, with Turkey in both camps, Russia could obtain F-35 data to improve the accuracy of the S-400 to shoot down Western aircraft.ALSO READ: Erdogan says Turkey will never go back from S-400 deal with RussiaThe Pentagon said that it had started to look at secondary sources to produce parts for F-35s that were being developed in Turkey.\u201cWe very much regret the current situation facing our F-35 partnership, but the (Defense Department) is taking prudent steps to protect the shared investments made in our critical technology,\u201d the statement said.The purchase of a Russian system is highly unusual for a member of NATO, the Western alliance forged to counter the Soviet Union.The US suspension announcement comes two days before foreign ministers from the 29 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are due in Washington to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the alliance.Last week, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu met in Turkey with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, and insisted that the S-400 purchase would go ahead.*AFP", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "united", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russiathe pentagon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T20:39:07.071+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d881fee88edcaa1f9d811bd700fe8d007641ed47", "url": "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/us/2019/04/02/us-supreme-court-rejects-oklahoma-death-row-inmates-appeal.html", "site_full": "www.thestar.com", "site": "thestar.com", "site_section": "http://www.thestar.com/feeds.articles.news.world.rss", "site_categories": ["media", "hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "TORONTO STAR", "title": "US Supreme Court rejects Oklahoma death row inmate\u2019s appeal", "title_full": "US Supreme Court rejects Oklahoma death row inmate\u2019s appeal | The Star", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.thestar.com/VjakB4Jhv4hbOakzJkzEwwgHxSc=/1280x1024/smart/filters:cb(1554226115782)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/us/2019/04/02/us-supreme-court-rejects-oklahoma-death-row-inmates-appeal/CER201-1031_2018_122005.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3654, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d881fee88edcaa1f9d811bd700fe8d007641ed47", "url": "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/us/2019/04/02/us-supreme-court-rejects-oklahoma-death-row-inmates-appeal.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "thestar.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "US Supreme Court rejects Oklahoma death row inmate\u2019s appeal", "text": "News World United States US Supreme Court rejects Oklahoma death row inmate\u2019s appeal By AP Member OKLAHOMA CITY - The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from an Oklahoma death row inmate who argued that a racist juror tainted the outcome of his trial.\nThe high court on Monday declined without comment to hear Julius Jones\u2019 case, The Oklahoman reported.\nThis Feb. 5, 2018, photo provided by the Oklahoma Department of Corrections shows Julius Jones. The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from the Oklahoma death row inmate who argued a juror during his trial harbored racial animosity toward him. The Oklahoman reports that the high court on Monday, April 1, 2019, declined without comment to hear Jones' case. Jones was sentenced to die for the July 1999 slaying of Paul Howell. ( AP / Oklahoma Department of Corrections ) Jones, who is black, was convicted of first-degree murder in the 1999 shooting death of Paul Howell, a 45-year-old Edmond man who was white. Jones argued that his case should be reviewed because a juror referred to him by a racial epithet.\n\u201cObviously, we are disappointed by the decision,\u201d said Dale Baich, a public defender in Arizona who represented Jones. \u201cThe systemic racial bias and the racist slur by a juror in this case led to a wrongful conviction. We will continue to investigate this and other issues as well.\u201d\nJones sought the appeal after Victoria Armstrong, a juror in the 2002 trial, told Jones\u2019 lawyers in 2017 that another juror commented that the trial proceedings were \u201ca waste of time.\u201d Armstrong said the juror used a racist slur to describe Jones and said authorities should \u201cshoot him behind the jail.\u201d\n The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals rejected his appeal last year, saying similar claims had been reviewed and rejected.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in January rejected another appeal Jones filed that argued that people of colour are more likely to be sentenced to death in Oklahoma when the victim is white.\nJones has now exhausted his appeals and could receive an execution date once the state resumes executions.\nOklahoma last executed an inmate in 2015. It put the process on hold after abandoning lethal injections to explore the use of nitrogen gas for executions.\n___\nInformation from: The Oklahoman, http://www.newsok.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.newsok.com"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul howell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edmond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julius jones", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "news world united states us supreme court", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "us supreme court", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "u.s. supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oklahoma department of corrections", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap / oklahoma department of corrections", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oklahoma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lahoma city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T20:41:49.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "55dbf665fb7ab1c301b2e94c715d859f14ff37d9", "url": "https://article.wn.com/view/2019/04/02/US_regulators_exploring_ways_CBD_products_could_be_legal_o/", "site_full": "article.wn.com", "site": "wn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.wn.com/English/keyword/world", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WN.com - World News", "title": "US regulators exploring ways CBD products could be legal", "title_full": "US regulators exploring ways CBD products could be legal - Worldnews.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5CHohD1ZDFk/0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5594, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "55dbf665fb7ab1c301b2e94c715d859f14ff37d9", "url": "https://article.wn.com/view/2019/04/02/US_regulators_exploring_ways_CBD_products_could_be_legal_o/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "wn.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "US regulators exploring ways CBD products could be legal", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 U.S. regulators say they're exploring ways CBD could be used legally in foods and dietary supplements, and will hold a public hearing on the cannabis compound next month.\nCBD comes from marijuana or hemp plants but does not cause a high.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ap", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T20:42:05.030+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "00d3709d581ef1ff02b0d14e2591d1b8ebc8734a", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/news/3447831-mastercard-invests-fintech-startup-focusing-small-mid-sized-firms", "site_full": "seekingalpha.com", "site": "seekingalpha.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "mutual_funds"], "section_title": "", "title": "Mastercard invests in fintech startup focusing on small/mid-sized firms - Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) | Seeking Alpha", "title_full": "Mastercard invests in fintech startup focusing on small/mid-sized firms - Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) | Seeking Alpha", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.999, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1432, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "00d3709d581ef1ff02b0d14e2591d1b8ebc8734a", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/news/3447831-mastercard-invests-fintech-startup-focusing-small-mid-sized-firms", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sa Editor Liz Kiesche", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Mastercard invests in fintech startup focusing on small/mid-sized firms - Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) | Seeking Alpha", "text": "Mastercard invests in fintech startup focusing on small/mid-sized firms Apr. 2, 2019 12:56 PM ET | About: Mastercard Incorporated (MA) | By: Liz Kiesche , SA News Editor Bill.com, a business payments and software platform, gets $88M in a funding round led by Franklin Templeton, with participation from Mastercard ( MA -0.1% ), Fidelity Investments Canada ULC, and others.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory\nA common refrain in right-wing circles and among centrist Democrats is that Americans fear socialism, so that the message and policy proposals of Democratic Socialists like Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) are dead on arrival everywhere except for urban enclaves populated by young hipsters.\nPresident Donald Trump has weaponized the idea that socialist policies turn off voters, blasting Democrats for allegedly going too far left.\n\u201cWe believe in the American Dream, not in the socialist nightmare,\u201d Trump told attendees of the Conservative Political Action Committee.\nBut socialist ideas have been tried in America before \u2014 and not in some hipster commune in Brooklyn.\nWriting in The Nation , the progressive journalist John Nichols describes how his hometown of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, embraced socialist figures and policies throughout the 20th century.\n\u201cIf I owned all the real estate in the world, I wouldn\u2019t feel so powerful as I do on the streets of this socialist city,\u201d declared former New York City councilman Baruch Vladeck when he arrived in Milwaukee in 1932 for the Socialist Party\u2019s national convention in that city.\nThat year, the socialist ticket did well, Nichols notes, prompting the winner, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, to meet with civil rights campaigner Norman Thomas. Thomas had been the Socialist Party\u2019s chosen candidate.\n\u201cRoosevelt\u2019s New Deal took the wind out of the Socialist Party\u2019s sails in the national arena, but the party remained a force in Milwaukee for decades to come,\u201d Nichols writes.\nMilwaukee would go on to elect three socialist Mayors, a historical fact referenced in the movie Wayne\u2019s World.\n\u201cI think one of the most interesting aspects of Milwaukee is the fact that it\u2019s the only major American city to have ever elected three Socialist mayors,\u201d rocker Alice Cooper observes in the film.\nNichols argues that instead of running from the word socialist, Democrats \u2014 who are holding their 2020 convention in Milwaukee \u2014 should use it.\n\u201cInstead of fearing mention of the S-word, Democrats can and should approach it as smart Republicans have the L-word\u2014\u201clibertarian.\u201d Republicans frequently borrow from the libertarian lexicon and toolbox, and acknowledge as much, without abandoning their essential partisanship,\u201d Nichols argues.\nAnd the demographics are changing.\n\u201cPolling tells us that young voters are more comfortable with socialism than capitalism,\u201d Nichols notes.\n\u201cOlder voters may still be susceptible to Republican appeals rooted in Cold War hysteria, but the challenges posed by the existential crisis of climate change and the radical transformation of our economy in an age of AI-driven automation are going to make everyone far more open to radical responses.\u201d\nAnd Democrats can pull from Milwaukee\u2019s history as a blueprint to best combat Trump in 2020 and Republicans beyond that. \u201cThat worked well for Milwaukee in the 20th century\u2014so much so that \u201csocialism\u201d ceased to be a scare word for the city\u2019s residents. What frightens Republicans today is that \u201csocialism\u201d is ceasing to be a scare word in our contemporary national discourse,\u201d Nichols concludes.

We've been following the villain.\"\nFurther explaining this theme of \"good vs. evil,\" Peele added that it's all up for interpretation.\n\"I say 'villain' lightly because I think there are many experiences of the film, and I think a lot of people go through a question of, 'What is good and evil?' Does that even exist?\" he continued. \"Both characters are lovable and terrifying, based on the lives they've led.

Court proceedings ended by late morning and were scheduled to resume Wednesday.\nThe presiding judge, Kathryn Quaintance, has barred prosecutors from presenting evidence of Noor's past work history.\nThat history includes an incident in which Noor allegedly pointed a gun at a motorist during a traffic stop, and occasionally refused to respond to police calls, according to The Minneapolis Star Tribune newspaper.\nMinnesota Public Radio reported that Noor was deemed \"asocial and socially introverted\" in his pre-employment psychological test, but that there were no signs of disqualifying mental illness.\nDamond's killing caused international outrage.\nThe 40-year-old Australian had moved to the United States to marry her American fiance, Don Damond, whose name she had already legally adopted, changing from her maiden name Ruszczyk.\nHer Australian relatives and the country's government demanded an explanation, while protests in Minneapolis led to the resignation of the city's police chief.\nAcross the country, prosecutors have had difficulty securing convictions against officers accused of wrongful shootings that often include racial overtones.\nTrials have mostly resulted in hung juries or acquittals, which at times have caused civil unrest in American cities.\nAnother Minnesota officer, Jeronimo Yanez, was fired from his job but acquitted after fatally shooting black motorist Philando Castile in 2016 .\nThere were several days of protests in Saint Louis, Missouri in 2017 , after a judge concluded there was not enough evidence to convict former officer Jason Stockley for shooting Anthony Lamar Smith after a 2011 car chase.\nIn Chicago , Jason Van Dyke was convicted of murder for killing black teen Laquan McDonald. The 17-year-old was shot 16 times, with most of those bullets striking him after he fell to the ground.

Negotiations between the two countries are due to kick off on Wednesday, with China's lead negotiator in Washington just days after wrapping up talks last week in Beijing.\nThe administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed import tariffs on Chinese goods to put pressure on Beijing to meet a long list of demands that would rewrite the terms of trade between the two countries.\nThe demands include changes to China's policies on intellectual property protection, technology transfers, industrial subsidies and other trade barriers.\nThis week, China's Vice Premier Liu He will meet with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to try to resolve U.S. demands that China make sweeping changes to policies governing intellectual property protections, technology transfers, industrial subsidies and market access.\n\"We're getting to the point where it's clear that both governments want a deal. The presidents want a deal, and they need to get through the end-game issues. This is a critical week,\" Myron Brilliant, the Chamber's head of International Affairs, told reporters on Tuesday.\nAbsent significant process this week on the \"tricky\" issues of tariffs and enforcement, the goal to complete a deal this month may be missed, Brilliant said.\nThe Trump administration and American companies want structural IP and market economy issues addressed, with a way to ensure China follows through on its promises, Brilliant said.\nU.S. officials favor tariffs as a way to maintain leverage on China and ensure those obligations are met. But it is unlikely that China would agree to an enforcement mechanism that included re-imposition of unilateral U.S. tariffs without the current tariffs being removed, Brilliant said.\nThe continued threat of tariffs hanging over commerce would mean a deal would not end the risk of investing in businesses or assets that have been affected by the trade war.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joseph dunford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark schiefelbein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fang fenghui", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "world chamber of commerce", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "chinese people's liberation army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mins ago reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. chamber of commerce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us joint chiefs of staff", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bayi building", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T22:28:21.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c814974cd66df1fd6faa2d47f542291a5e9f54e9", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/marijuana/2019/04/02/regulators-exploring-ways-cbd-products-could-legal/40nF0FnoM6L9Nzwmaz8QvO/story.html", "site_full": "www.bostonglobe.com", "site": "bostonglobe.com", "site_section": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/health-wellness?p1=BGHeader", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Health &amp; Wellness - The Boston Globe", "title": "US regulators exploring ways CBD products could be legal", "title_full": "US regulators exploring ways CBD products could be legal - The Boston Globe", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.198, "main_image": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2019/04/02/BostonGlobe.com/Metro/Images/2be11856db5046dc9b639cd52c22d8aa-2be11856db5046dc9b639cd52c22d8aa-0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2402, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c814974cd66df1fd6faa2d47f542291a5e9f54e9", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/marijuana/2019/04/02/regulators-exploring-ways-cbd-products-could-legal/40nF0FnoM6L9Nzwmaz8QvO/story.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bostonglobe.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "US regulators exploring ways CBD products could be legal", "text": " Jennifer Lett/South Florida Sun-Sentinel via Associated Press A worker adds CBD oil to a drink at a coffee shot in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

Davella III The US Navy amphibious assault ship USS Wasp was recently seen sailing through the South China Sea with an unusually heavy configuration of F-35s.\nThe Wasp deployed carrying at least 10 F-35B Lightning II stealth fighters, more than the usual load of six of these hard-hitting fifth-generation jet fighters, The National Interest first reported , noting that the warship may be testing the \"light carrier\" warfighting concept known as the \"Lightning Carrier.\"\n\u00a9 U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Daniel Barker The amphibious assault ship is participating in Exercise Balikatan 2019, during which \"US and Philippine forces will conduct amphibious operations, live-fire training, urban operations, aviation operations, and counterterrorism response,\" the US Navy said in a statement announcing the Wasp's arrival.\nThe annual exercise prepares troops for potential crises in the Indo-Pacific region. This year's drills are focused on maritime security, a growing concern as China strives to achieve dominance over strategic waterways.\n: US Marines are practicing seizing small islands as a possible China fight looms in the Pacific\nThis is the first time the Wasp and its Marine Corps F-35B fighters have participated in the Balikatan drills.\nTogether, the ship and its fighters \"represent an increase in military capability committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific region,\" the Navy said , using rhetoric consistent with US military freedom-of-navigation operations and bomber flights in the South China Sea, which are intended to check China.\n\u00a9 US Navy/USS Wasp/Facebook The F-35B is the Marine Corps' variant of the Joint Strike Fighter. The Air Force and Navy are also fielding versions of the fighter, the latter designed to operate on full-size carriers.\nThe F-35B, which was declared combat-ready in 2015, can perform short takeoffs and vertical landings and is suited for operating on amphibious assault ships.\n: US Navy wants to get rid of an aircraft carrier to buy new weapons needed for a next-level fight with China\nIn addition to at least 10 F-35s, the configuration seen on the Wasp reportedly includes four MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and two MH-60S Seahawk helicopters. Typically, there would be fewer fighters and more rotor aircraft, The War Zone reported .\nDeploying with more F-35s than usual could be a first step toward fielding of light carriers - an approach that could theoretically boost not only the size of the carrier force but also its firepower.\n\u00a9 U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Daniel Barker The concept is not without precedent. During the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, amphibious assault ships sailed with up to 20 AV-8B Harriers, becoming \"Harrier Carriers.\"\nThis concept has been rebranded as the \"Lightning Carrier,\" a reference to the fifth-generation fighters the warships would carry into battle.\nThe War Zone explains that an America-class amphibious assault ship, successors to the Wasp class, could carry between 16 and 20 F-35s in a light-carrier configuration.\n\u00a9 U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Benjamin F. Davella III Last fall, a US F-35B launched from the Wasp-class amphibious assault ship USS Essex and conducted the fifth-generation platform's first combat mission, striking militant targets in the Middle East.\nIn February, the F-35B achieved another first as it carried out strikes in \"Beast Mode,\" meaning an external ordnance loadout, in the Pacific.\n: US Navy's carrier-based F-35C stealth fighters may not be ready for combat after all\nThe light-carrier concept could see more F-35s doing maritime operations, delivering a massive increase in firepower.\nThis could prove beneficial if the Navy goes ahead with plans to scrap a Nimitz-class carrier as it bets big on the troubled Ford-class carriers and other future combat platforms.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.businessinsider.com/", "https://www.c7f.navy.mil/Media/News/Display/Article/1801132/uss-wasp-spmagtf-4-arrive-in-the-philippines-for-exercise-balikatan/", "https://www.businessinsider.com/us-navy-to-cut-carrier-to-buy-new-weapons-needed-against-china-2019-3?utm_source=msn.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=msn-story&utm_campaign=bodyurl", "https://www.businessinsider.com/us-marines-seize-small-island-to-train-for-a-possible-china-fight-2019-3?utm_source=msn.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=msn-story&utm_campaign=bodyurl", "https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=6134", "https://www.businessinsider.com/us-f-35-enters-combat-for-the-first-time-in-afghanistan-2018-9?utm_source=msn.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=msn-story&utm_campaign=bodyurl", "https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/light-aircraft-carriers-us-marines-might-have-more-f-35s-fighting-sea-50052", "https://www.businessinsider.com/us-navys-f-35cs-may-not-be-ready-for-combat-after-all-2019-3?utm_source=msn.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=msn-story&utm_campaign=bodyurl", "https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/27253/u-s-amphibious-assault-ship-in-south-china-sea-with-unprecedentedly-large-load-of-f-35bs", "https://www.military.com/dodbuzz/2019/02/12/f-35bs-conduct-strikes-beast-mode-first-time-pacific-region.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "benjamin f. davella", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel barker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan pickrell", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "us navy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "national interest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. navy", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south china sea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T22:43:23.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "860f1dd615db470aa41ed8b75d7942757043b1da", "url": "https://za.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-stocks-snapshotwall-street-opens-flat-after-threeday-surge-1441091", "site_full": "za.investing.com", "site": "investing.com", "site_section": "https://za.investing.com/news/stock-market-news", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Stock Market News - Investing.com ZA", "title": "US STOCKS SNAPSHOT-Wall Street opens flat after three-day surge By Reuters", "title_full": "US STOCKS SNAPSHOT-Wall Street opens flat after three-day surge By Reuters", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.017, "main_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB6J0AJ_L.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 699, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "860f1dd615db470aa41ed8b75d7942757043b1da", "url": "https://za.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-stocks-snapshotwall-street-opens-flat-after-threeday-surge-1441091", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Reuters", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "US STOCKS SNAPSHOT-Wall Street opens flat after three-day surge By Reuters", "text": "\u00a9 Reuters.

The United States Air Force has once again rejected taking delivery of new Boeing KC-46 Pegasus tanker jets after discovering foreign object debris (FOD) left inside the aircraft by Boeing workers . This is the second time the USAF has stopped accepting deliveries of new KC-46s this year for the same exact reason, Reuters reported. The Air Force initially halted deliveries of the Boeing 767 airliner-based tanker planes for two weeks in early March. At the time, assistant secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Will Roper, told reporters that debris such as tools was left in parts of the plane that could be a potential safety hazard, Defense News reported. According to Reuters, the Air Force decided to halt deliveries again on March 23. \"The Air Force again halted acceptance of new KC-46 tanker aircraft as we continue to work with Boeing to ensure that every aircraft delivered meets the highest quality and safety standards,\" a USAF spokesperson told the Air Force Times in an emailed statement . \"This week our inspectors identified additional foreign object debris and areas where Boeing did not meet quality standards.\" Read more : FAA expects Boeing to come up with new software to fix the grounded 737 Max in a matter of weeks . \"Resolving this issue is a company and program priority \u2014 Boeing is committed to delivering FOD-free aircraft to the Air Force,\" Boeing told Business Insider in a statement. \"Although we've made improvements to date, we can do better.\" \"We are currently conducting additional company and customer inspections of the jets and have implemented preventative action plans,\" the Boeing statement went on to say. \"We have also incorporated additional training, more rigorous clean-as-you-go practices and FOD awareness days across the company to stress the importance and urgency of this issue. Safety and quality are our highest priority.\" Boeing commenced deliveries of the KC-46 tanker in January. The plane was originally slated for delivery to the Air Force in 2017.

Not only had the team been fighting for pay equality via lawsuitssince their World Cup win in 2015, but it just so happened to be International Women's Day when news of the latest suit broke. Whether the timing was intentional or not,the team sent a clear message \u2014 the defaulted response that \"men are better to watch\" is no longer good enough. They are good enough, and they aren't about to settle for anything less than what they deserve.\nWhile the previous battle focused mostly on their paychecks, the women's national team is now expanding their grievances to include everyday discrimination. From whether or not they play on artificial turf or grass, to how often they play, and the medical attention they receive, the team is ready to address all levels of inequity that affect their game.\nFor Megan Rapinoe, forward and co-captain of the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team, these discrepancies have been part of her career from the very beginning. \"Traveling overseas, sitting in economy and knowing knowing the men always travel overseas and they fly first class, the different hotels, [and the fact] that we stay in playing on turf all the time [are some examples],\" she tells Bustle at a press event for Nike where the latest Word Cup jersey kits were revealed. \"We don't anymore because we actually had to cancel a game because the turf was so bad.\"\nShe says on top of the obvious pay discrepancies, the team's fight against injustices is aboutreading between the lines and looking to see if games are being invested in equally, how much marketing and promotion there is of games, and how many women have brand sponsorships compared to the men. When making those comparisons, the women's teams were still coming up woefully short, and it's perpetuating a notion that not investing in women's sports is justified.\n\"If you spend 10 times more on promoting the men, they're probably going to be 10 times more successful,\" Rapinoe says. \"So if everything's equal and they're 10 times more successful, then we can have a conversation. [...] But I think that there's just so much potential left on the table with this team because we're not funded equally.\" Courtesy of Nike\nBut the argument that \"women aren't as fun to watch\" is starting to become a moot point. According to the New York Times, the 2015 women's World Cup final was the most watched soccer game in U . S . history \u2014 25.4 million people tuned in to watch the U . S. victory over Japan. But if visibility and viewership is what it takes to achieve equity, there is still a ways to go. The Tucker Center for Research on Girls & Women in Sport found that, though women represent 40 percent of all participants in sports, they only represent four percent of media coverage. Al Jazeera also reports that 99 percent of all sponsorship money goes to men, with Serena Williams being the only female in the top 100 highest-paid athletes in the world.\nBut some brands arestarting to challenge the idea thatsports has to be a male-dominated industry solely targeting male viewership.For example, Nike's most recent \" Dream Crazier \" campaign shines a light on sexist double standards in sports, which does something incredibly unique \u2014 not only is the sports apparel brand marketing directlyto women, they're calling out the difficulties women face within sports. In 2017, Gatorade's \" Sisters In Sweat \" campaignfeatured Serena Williamstalking to her newborn daughter, encouraging her and all women to stay in sports as a source of strength.\n\"You look at branding agencies that are starting to catch on very quickly,\" Rapinoe says. \"You've got a huge share of the market controlled by women, whether because we're the buyers of the house or just that we're half of the population. So why wouldn't you brand directly towards women or cater directly towards women in all of these different ways?\"\nIn Rapinoe's opinion, making women a target audience is just one piece of the puzzle that can push the momentum forward for women's sports overall. The second is to simply show up and spread the word.\n\"Continue to tell people about it and talk about it,\" she says. \"If you are a hater and you've never been to game, then [...] go to the game and just watch. And then if you really truly have watched a number of games, and you hate it, then you don't have come.\"\nAs Rapinoe says, it all boils down to a choice. If the sports industry chooses to champion men's sports over women's by putting money, viewership, and representation behind them, the scales are obviously tipped in their favor. \"You're just choosing one team over another, it's not really about who's popular, and who's not.\"\nBut for Rapinoe, being a female soccer player isn't just an uphill battle to do what she loves on fairer terms. She finds herself at an interesting moment in history where she can spearhead a change not just in this traditional part of American culture, but in cultural attitudes toward women overall.\n\"I think we're at such an incredible moment to be at the forefront of all this and to be able to be leaders in the community and to be able to [...] just stand with the Times Up movement and stand with the Me Too movement, and stand with all these other women fighting to break that glass ceiling and achieve pay equity,\" Rapinoe says. \"It's inspiring to be able to be in proximity of all of that and all of these inspiring women, the people that we've been able to meet along the way and the gains that we've been able to make, it really is a transformational time.\"\nRapinoe says she feels hopeful when looking at her career's trajectory\u2014 things have changed a lot since she first started, and she's proud to be a part of something bigger that was able to engineer that change. And other women in sports are listening. The New York Times reported that after the U.S. women's team went public with their pay discrimination lawsuit, other teams from around the world, often in other sports, reached out to help fight for similar gains. The team has become a leader and an example in the space of what collective bargaining for women can look like, The New York Times states.\nAnd Rapinoe says that though future female athletes will inherent vestiges of these problems, they have opportunities to break similar ground.\n\"[Being a female athlete] is really is an opportunity to do something bigger than yourself, and to [...] move the needle, and in so many ways,\" she says. \"It's very inspiring to see that change happen in the world as you're happening with it.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. soccer star megan rapinoe", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fighting against pay inequality & other discrepancies in her sport u.s. soccer star megan rapinoe", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "united states soccer federation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "courtesy of nike", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T23:12:27.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b7d6385e2f19a41791ae207e8c664f06807a36c8", "url": "https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/04/02/apple-narrowly-eclipses-microsoft-to-regain-status-as-most-valuable-company-in-us", "site_full": "appleinsider.com", "site": "appleinsider.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["mac_support", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Apple narrowly eclipses Microsoft to regain status as most valuable company in US", "title_full": "Apple narrowly eclipses Microsoft to regain status as most valuable company in US", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/30248-49935-tim-cook-his-arms-up-xl.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6410, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 8}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b7d6385e2f19a41791ae207e8c664f06807a36c8", "url": "https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/04/02/apple-narrowly-eclipses-microsoft-to-regain-status-as-most-valuable-company-in-us", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Roger Fingas", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Apple narrowly eclipses Microsoft to regain status as most valuable company in US", "text": "\u2013 A + Apple narrowly eclipses Microsoft to regain status as most valuable company in US By Roger Fingas\nTuesday, April 02, 2019, 01:08 pm PT (04:08 pm ET)\nAfter a brisk day of trading, Apple regained its spot as the U.S.'s most valuable company by market value, hitting a cap of $914.86 billion at close.\nThe company beat out Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet, the only three companies within striking distance according to NASDAQ rankings . Microsoft was formerly the frontrunner, having surpassed Apple in November .\nMicrosoft closed Tuesday at $914.45 billion in market capitalization.\nThe reason for Apple's resurgence in the short-term isn't clear, given analyst reaction to the \"its show time\" Apple News event, but analysts and investors appear to be regaining confidence in the wake of a disastrous December quarter which saw iPhone sales tumble 15 percent year-over-year . The company saw its worst performance in China, battered by a combination of lower-cost local phone brands, a weak economy, and its decision to once again hike entry-level iPhone prices, exacerbated by exchange rates.\nIt has since adopted more aggressive sales tactics to compensate, cutting prices in some countries and extending extra trade-in credit.\nSome analysts are pinning their hopes on Apple's growing services business, which includes divisions like Apple Music, the App Store, and its upcoming Apple TV+ video service , coupled with the now-available Apple News+ .\nWhile the services themselves may add a modest boost to profits, the real benefit is expected to be keeping people locked into the Apple ecosystem. People may be less likely to switch to Android, Windows, or Chrome OS if they're invested in Apple services, even if its March 25 products are available on outside platforms.\nApple will reveal its quarterly results on April 30 .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roger fingas", "sentiment": "positive"}], "organizations": [{"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T23:16:32.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "93578f84175932fd3ba6ef6bff66e580f75f6980", "url": "https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/huaweis-urges-the-us-to-drop-losers-attitude-as-its-reiterates-allegations-for-spying-6354041.html", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Huawei's urges the US to drop 'loser's attitude' as its reiterates allegations for spying- Technology News, Firstpost", "title_full": "Huawei's urges the US to drop 'loser's attitude' as its reiterates allegations for spying- Technology News, Firstpost", "published": "2019-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/huawei-smartphone.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "93578f84175932fd3ba6ef6bff66e580f75f6980", "url": "https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/huaweis-urges-the-us-to-drop-losers-attitude-as-its-reiterates-allegations-for-spying-6354041.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-03-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Huawei's urges the US to drop 'loser's attitude' as its reiterates allegations for spying- Technology News, Firstpost", "text": "Huawei's network business first drop in revenue in two years causes slower pace of profit growth for 2018. Reuters Mar 30, 2019 10:08:17 IST\nChina\u2019s Huawei Technologies called on Washington to drop the \u201closer\u2019s attitude\u201d and once again rubbished U.S. allegations its gear could be used by Beijing for spying, as its network business weakened amid mounting global scrutiny. Image: Reuters\n\u201cThe U.S. government has a loser\u2019s attitude. It wants to smear Huawei because it cannot compete against Huawei,\u201d Guo Ping, rotating chairman of the world\u2019s top producer of telecoms equipment and No.3 maker of smartphones, said on Friday.\n\u201cI hope the U.S. can adjust its attitude,\u201d Guo said at a press briefing that was attended by more than 100 journalists from across the world.\nThe U.S. embassy in China declined to comment.\nHuawei reported a slower pace of profit growth for 2018 as its network business saw its first drop in revenue in two years, overshadowing a robust 45 percent jump in its smartphone unit.\nHuawei\u2019s outlook has come under a cloud over the past year with the United States voicing concerns that its equipment could be used for espionage. Washington has also urged its allies to ban Huawei from building next-generation 5G mobile networks.\nThe latest blow for the company came on Thursday when Britain rebuked it for failing to fix long-standing security flaws in its mobile network equipment and revealed new \u201csignificant technical issues\u201d.\nFor 2018, the Shenzen-based firm reported a net profit of 59.3 billion yuan ($9 billion), up 25 percent from a year ago, versus a 28 percent rise in 2017. Revenue from its carrier business fell 1.3 percent to 294 billion yuan, which it blamed on telecommunications industry investment cycles.\nHowever, the surge in its consumer business sales to a record 348.9 billion yuan, driven by demand for its premium smartphone models such as the P series and Mate series, helped push global revenue to above $100 billion for the first time.\nIts total revenue rose nearly 20 percent to about 721 billion yuan, marking the fastest pace of growth in two years.\nThe performance of consumer business was in line with what Huawei flagged in January, when it also said it could become the world\u2019s biggest-selling smartphone vendor this year.\nGuo said he expects all three business groups - consumer, carrier and enterprise - to post double-digit growth this year, although he did not provide a specific number.\nThe company has previously said it was targeting total revenue of $125 billion this year, a record high.\n\u201cMoving forward, we will do everything we can to shake off outside distractions, improve management and make progress towards our strategic goals,\u201d Guo said.\nHuawei has \u201cprepared some inventories for uncertainties\u201d that has reduced its net cash position, Guo added, without giving any details.\nSPYING WOULD BE \u201cSUICIDE\u201d\nTo fight global concerns over its gear, Huawei has launched an unprecedented media blitz by opening up its campus to journalists and parading its typically low-key founder, Ren Zhengfei, in front of media.\nIt has stepped up the campaign in recent months after Meng Wanzhou , Huawei CFO and Ren\u2019s daughter, was arrested in Canada in December at U.S. behest on charges of bank and wire fraud in violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran. She denies wrongdoing.\nThe company has said the spying concerns are unfounded.\n\u201cSpying would be equal to suicide,\u201d said Song Liuping, Huawei\u2019s chief legal officer.\n\u201cWe have no intention of committing suicide.\u201d\nHuawei derived 48.4 percent of its business from overseas markets in 2018, versus 49.5 percent a year earlier.\nTech2 is now on WhatsApp. For all the buzz on the latest tech and science, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

Uber has been told by its investment bankers that it could be valued at as much as $120 billion.\nThe success of the IPO came despite Lyft\u2019s steep loses, criticism of its dual-class share structure and some concerns over its strategy for autonomous driving, for fear of missing out on the company\u2019s strong revenue growth. For representational image. Reuters\n\u201cIn a good market, people look beyond things. They don\u2019t see the problems as much,\u201d said Brian Hamilton, co-founder of data firm Sageworks, speaking before the pricing.\nThe ride-hailing industry is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years, as young millennials in big cities choose not to buy their own car. Yet the sector is fraught with questions about the future of automated driving, regulatory pushback and legal challenges over drivers\u2019 pay and benefits.\nLyft\u2019s valuation makes it the biggest company to go public since Alibaba Group Holding Ltd in 2014. It paves the way for other Silicon Valley companies seeking to float in the stock market this year, including Pinterest Inc, Slack Technologies Inc and Postmates Inc.\nLyft raised $2.34 billion its IPO. It said it priced 32.5 million shares, slightly more that it was offering originally, at $72, the top of its already elevated $70-$72 per share target range. Lyft started its IPO investor road show earlier this month with a target range of $62-$68 per share.\nThe stock is set to begin trading on the Nasdaq on Friday under the symbol \u201cLYFT\u201d.\nThe IPO market had a slow start in 2019 due to volatile markets at the end of last year and the government shutdown in January blocking US regulators from processing new IPO applicants.\nWith startups like Lyft staying private for longer, there is a backlog of demand to allocate more money to stocks which are considered high-growth in order to diversify away from Wall Street\u2019s FAANG trade which is made up of Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Netflix Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc.\nNevertheless, there are concerns among some investors that these IPOs may be coming at the peak of the market, when the benchmark S&P 500 Index has risen more than 200 percent since 2008.\n\u201cThey\u2019re buying at the top of a bull market that\u2019s lasted for nine years,\u201d said Roberts.\nProfitabiliy questions\nLyft, which was valued at $15 billion in final private fundraising round in 2018, kicked off its 10-day IPO roadshow on 18 March. The company\u2019s executives made stops in cities such as New York, Baltimore, Kansas and Los Angeles. Reuters reported the IPO was oversubscribed after just two days.\nIt has now nearly 40 percent of the US ride-sharing market, according to its regulatory filing.\nLyft\u2019s revenue was $2.16 billion for 2018, double the previous year\u2019s and far higher than $343 million in 2016. It posted a loss of $911 million in 2018 versus $688 million in 2017.\nLyft was launched in 2012 and is led by its founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer. The company has not laid out a timeline for when it will turn a profit, but stock investors have shown patience in the past if they feel the growth will pay off, with companies like Amazon staying in the red until years after its IPO.\nLyft is smaller than rival Uber and so far has focused on the US and Canadian markets. Uber, a global logistics and transportation company most recently valued at $76 billion in the private market, is seeking a valuation as high as $120 billion, although some analysts have pegged its value closer to $100 billion based on selected financial figures it has disclosed.\nUnlike Uber, which has developed its own self-driving division, Lyft has chosen to strike partnerships to expand in the sector, including with car parts suppliers Magna International Inc and Aptiv Plc.

Source: Hartford police More A university student has been charged with attempted murder after allegedly stabbing his classmates while re-enacting a scene from the movie The Butterfly Effect. Jake Wascher, 20, was working on a production in a dormitory at the University of Hartford in the US state of Connecticut on Sunday at about 1pm when he allegedly stabbed a 21-year-old in the chest and arm with a knife, The Hartford Courant reports. The 21-year-old had been directing a film Wascher was in. A 19-year-old with the pair pleaded for the stabbing to stop and it is alleged Wascher then turned to him, stabbed him in the chest and back, threw the knife at him and fled the dorm. A witness claims a kitchen knife about 15cm long was used. The teenager was hospitalised in a critical condition in intensive care while the other victim has since been discharged from hospital. Wascher was arrested at a wooded area near campus two hours after the alleged attack and told police he \u201cleft the scissors on the basketball court that I used to do it\u201d, according to a police report seen by the Hartford Courant. Police said the students were re-enacting a scene from the 2004 film The Butterfly Effect. The University of Hartford (pictured) said in a statement the incident was frightening and unsettling.

April 2, 2019 More\nBy AMY BETH HANSON, Associated Press\nHELENA, Mont. (AP) \u2014 The Montana Senate has endorsed a bill that would require the state to provide services to struggling families so fewer children are placed in foster care.\nA plan is required for Montana to be eligible for federal funding for mental health and substance abuse treatment, parenting skills training or counseling for families whose children are in danger of being removed from their home.\nThe bill already passed the House and was unanimously endorsed by the Senate Tuesday. It faces a final Senate vote before being submitted to the governor.\nThe Department of Public Health and Human Services says it is developing a plan to identify available services, the expected results and how child welfare workers would be trained.\nThe legislation gives the agency until August 2020 to develop the plan so it can apply for funding in 2021.\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press .

I just spent Thursday with him filming a video for a beautiful new song we created with Khaled. We filmed in Inglewood, close to where he grew up.

Utterly stunned that he's gone so soon.\n\u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) April 1, 2019\nIt was in March 2019, during a broadcasted conversation on REAL 92.3, the rapper gave an insight into what fans can expect in the year ahead, announcing his joint album with Meek Mill. \"We've been cutting ideas and just getting in. We got a couple records that's going to go off for the summer. It's not hard at all we just got to lock in and get the records done,\" Nipsey shared. \"We working right now as we speak. We on album time right now. Next thing we going to put out musically is an album,\" he said.\nHe added, \"Wisdom. You be in the game for a while and you learn this shit and you figure out what works for you,\" Nipsey explained, touching on Meek Mill's growth as a person and artist. \"I just think Meek's elevated. He applied the game he got from being in the game for a while.\"\nUnfortunately, he couldn't stay alive for long.

Santosh Giri, 32, was produced in the court in San Jose on March 28 | TNN | Apr 2, 2019, 20:01 IST HYDERABAD: Three Indian businessmen were arrested by US authorities in California in an alleged visa fraud and conspiracy case. They pleaded not guilty and have been granted bail by the court. Their next date of trial is May 13. Kishore Dattapuram, Kumar Aswapathi and Santosh Giri hail from the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and set up a consulting firm in Santa Clara in the US. The allegation against them is they set up Nanosemantics Inc and between May 2012 and 2015 submitted fraudulent H-1B visa applications. The Department of Justice in an indictment said this was \u2018in order to gain a competitive advantage over competing firms\u2019. The three of them were arrested on March 27. While Kishore Dattapuram, 49, was produced in the federal court in San Jose, Kumar Aswapathi, 49, was produced in the federal court in Austin. Santosh Giri, 32, was produced in the court in San Jose on March 28. \u201cAn indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt,\u201d the Department of Justice said. However, if convicted, the defendants face a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a fine of 2.5 lakh dollars plus restitution if appropriate for each violation of 18 USC 1546 (a) (visa fraud). They can also face a maximum sentence of five years in prison and fine of 2.5 lakh dollars, plus restitution if appropriate for the conspiracy count. The Department of Justice, US Attorney\u2019s Office, Northern District of California said a federal grand jury had indicted the three defendants in the visa fraud scheme. US attorney Adavid L Anderson and Department of Homeland Security, Home Security Investigations special agent in charge Ryal L Spardlin said there were indicted on 11 counts. The defendants company allegedly submitted fraudulent applications for high-tech worker visas. Their Santa Clara-based consulting firm provided services including placing skilled foreign workers at software and technology companies in the Bay Area. According to the indictment, the defendants worked together to submit the fraudulent H-1B visa applications so that foreign workers could obtain temporary authorities to live and work for employer in the United States. The Department of Justice explained that in order to secure an H-1B visa, an employer or other sponsor must submit an \u201cI-129\u201d petition to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. A petition and association documentation must confirm the existence and duration of the job waiting for the worker, and describe key details including wages. However, the defendants allegedly used Nanosemantics to submit I-129 petitions and obtain H-1B visas for workers that the defendants could later place at local companies. \u201cBy maintaining a group of available workers, the defendants could gain a competitive advantage over consultants that properly applied for paperwork only after matching a qualified worker to the available job,\u201d the Department of Justice said. According to the indictment, several of the I-129 petitions submitted by defendants started that particular workers had specific jobs waiting for them at designated companies when, in reality, the defendants knew that these jobs did not exist. \u201cFurther, the defendants allegedly sought the cooperation of third parties to conceal their fraud,\u201d the indictment said. The defendants allegedly orchestrated payments by Nanosemantics to at least one individual for permission to list his company as the employer for foreign workers even though Nanosemantics actually intended to place the workers else. \u201cFurther, defendants coached foreign workers and others, to respond to government inquiries in a way that would prevent the government from discovering the fraud,\u201d the Department of Justice said", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kishore dattapuram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kumar aswapathi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santosh giri", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nanosemantics inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa clara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "telangana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andhra pradesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san jose", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T01:00:30.056+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6be0739ce1ad40391101dbda47268caaa4b40644", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/news/3447377-lithium-americas-gets-160m-investment-cauchari-olaroz-project", "site_full": "seekingalpha.com", "site": "seekingalpha.com", "site_section": "https://seekingalpha.com/market-news/commodities", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "mutual_funds"], "section_title": "Commodity News | Seeking Alpha", "title": "Lithium Americas gets $160M investment for Cauchari-Olaroz project - Lithium Americas Corp.

Over time, they say, it will only worsen the problem.\nAt risk of falling on the chopping block are development programs that work to tackle the root causes driving migration: poverty, inequality, violence and corruption. These include outreach to at-risk youth to combat forced gang recruitment as well as programs to address gender-based violence and support education, workforce development and the uphill fight to root out endemic graft.\nIn this Nov. 25, 2018 file photo, a migrant woman helps carry a handmade U.S. flag up the riverbank at the Mexico-U.S. border after getting past Mexican police at the Chaparral border crossing in Tijuana, Mexico, as a group of migrants tries to reach the U.S. Activists, officials and social workers in Central America were staggered by the idea that U.S. President Donald Trump thinks he will help reduce immigration, by cutting off nearly $500 million in aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador; exactly the opposite will happen, they say. ( Ramon Espinosa, File / AP Photo ) In this June 16, 2016 file photo, inmates ride in a bus out of the Cojutepeque prison in El Salvador. El Salvador had a homicide rate of 50.3 per 100,000 people in 2018. President Donald Trump said that he is cutting off nearly $500 million in aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador help reduce immigration.

( Charlie Riedel, File / AP Photo ) \u201cIt\u2019s illogical and it\u2019s irresponsible. ... You\u2019re talking about long-term challenges that are going to require long-term, sustainable solutions,\u201d said Adriana Beltr\u00e1n, a Central America specialist at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u201cSo rather than helping to stabilize the situation and try to address these long-term challenges, the cut in assistance will only make the situation worse.\u201d\n\u201cGutting important programs,\u201d she added, \u201cwill eventually lead to more migration, more insecurity, more corruption, more impunity in these countries.\u201d\nIt\u2019s still not clear exactly what, when or how much could be cut.\n Trump said last week that \u201cwe were paying them tremendous amounts of money and we\u2019re not paying them anymore because they haven\u2019t done a thing for us,\u201d and mentioned a figure of $500 million.\nState Department spokesman Robert Palladino said Tuesday that the amount affected by any aid cut would be $450 million from fiscal year 2018 as well as an as yet undetermined amount from 2017.\n\u201cThe president has made clear that the decision is aimed at securing the United States borders and protecting American citizens,\u201d Palladino said. \u201cThese programs have not effectively prevented illegal immigration from coming to the United States, and they\u2019ve not achieved the desired results.\u201d\nThe aid is meant to promote democracy-building, good governance, trade, agriculture, education, health, public safety and law enforcement. Experts say all of those areas play a direct role in whether people feel they can get by or even survive in their home countries.\nReaction from the three governments has been muted so far, perhaps for fear of angering Trump.\nBoth Honduras and El Salvador pointedly said they had not been formally notified of any specific cuts in U.S. aid. Honduran Defence Minister Fredy D\u00edaz said co-operation with the United States on security is \u201cunchanged,\u201d while the Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the relationship has been \u201csolid, close and positive.\u201d\nSalvadoran Vice-President Oscar Ortiz said Tuesday that an aid cut would not solve the migration problem but have the opposite effect. \u201cThe best way to tackle the issue of migration ... is not with this type of decision,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best way to tackle the issue is to keep working together.\u201d\n Guatemala, the source of much of the recent migration from the region, was particularly circumspect, with presidential spokesman Alfredo Brito saying simply that the official response was not to comment for the time being.\nBut those carrying out the boots-on-the-ground work are concerned.\nRick Jones, who works in El Salvador as the youth and migration policy adviser for Catholic Relief Services, counsels young people to keep them out of gangs and help them get jobs. He also runs behavioural therapy for inmates to deter them from returning to crime \u2014 all things that have \u201ca positive impact to help guys think about and change their behaviour,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s seen as unglamorous but badly needed work, especially in a place like El Salvador, which has a homicide rate that is among the world\u2019s highest at more than 50 per 100,000 people last year.\nBut all $38 million that Catholic Relief Services gets from U.S. government agencies to run programs in the three countries \u2014 including ones on education and jobs \u2014 could disappear if the cutoff goes through.\nIf that happens, \u201cit will be sending the message, \u2018Help is not on the way ... and you\u2019re going to be left on your own,\u2019\u201d Jones said. \u201cAnd basically people left on their own are going to be more desperate and more people are going to leave.\u201d\nLikewise, Vicki Gass, Oxfam America senior policy adviser for Central America and Mexico, said that axing funding for programs that have been running for years, would, in many cases, \u201cwaste U.S. taxpayer dollars that have already been invested\u201d and \u201cfoster the same instability that is making people flee in the first place.\u201d\nSome government programs aimed at persuading Central Americans not to emigrate have been put in place, in part in response to Trump\u2019s earlier criticism about the migrant caravans that brought thousands trekking toward the U.S. border, and the threatened aid cutoff does not take that into account, officials say.\n\u201cThis goes against what we have seen in reports that show there have really been some decreases in migration, and that they are the result of the efforts being made on this issue,\u201d said lawmaker Yanci Urbina of the left-leaning FMLN party in El Salvador, the least populated of the three countries and a distant third in terms of how many migrants are heading for the U.S.\nSalvadoran Treasury Minister Nelson Fuentes said U.S. aid in his country includes $20 million in technical and fiscal funding over five years, and the government has not gotten word of any cuts. Another $200 million to spur growth and employment is managed in tandem with the World Bank, and it remains to be seen whether this will be reduced. Finally there are direct donations from Washington to the Salvadoran government and private organizations.\nFuentes said aid for security and migration could be affected, but that actively funded contracts should not be.\nIn Guatemala, the most significant aid comes in security assistance to fight drug trafficking \u2014 and that has already come under scrutiny recently over questionable use of armoured vehicles donated by Washington. Other funds through USAID go to help programs on things like agriculture and education in poor rural communities, plus training for prosecutors, who have waged a high-profile fight against corruption in recent years, or for judges.\nHonduran political analyst Omar Garc\u00eda called U.S. aid to his country \u201cvital\u201d and said the threatened cuts show that Washington is \u201can unreliable ally for Honduras.\u201d\nLike Guatemala, Honduras has backed the Trump administration on key issues such as recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and on the political crisis in Venezuela. It remains to be seen whether such support could waver.\n\u201cA sense of nationalism is surging in this country ... and that could be a good thing,\u201d Garc\u00eda said.\nBeltr\u00e1n noted that most of the assistance now in jeopardy does not go directly to the three countries\u2019 governments but to agencies, NGOs, church groups and others.\nShe predicted that an attempt to cut aid could face pushback in Congress if funds are reprogrammed without lawmakers\u2019 consent. Particularly in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, members and committees could try to place holds on money in the next funding bill, she said.\n\u201cIt is going to ensue into a battle,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n said, \u201cbecause it is Congress that at the end of the day has the power of the purse.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writers Sonia Perez D. in Guatemala City, Freddy Cuevas in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, Matthew Lee in Washington and Mark Stevenson and Peter Orsi in Mexico City contributed to this report.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to fix misattributed Quote: s which came from Honduran political analyst Omar Garc\u00eda.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marcos aleman th", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "central america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "news world americas us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tijuana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el salvador", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san salvador", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guatemala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "honduras", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T01:26:54.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "90688df400fde6dde4e8a5badeb19d303f13a508", "url": "https://www.fxstreet.com/news/nzd-usd-better-than-forecast-new-zealand-gdt-data-triggered-short-covering-from-200-day-sma-201904022219", "site_full": "www.fxstreet.com", "site": "fxstreet.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "", "title": "NZD/USD: Better than forecast New Zealand GDT data triggered short covering from 200-day SMA", "title_full": "NZD/USD: Better than forecast New Zealand GDT data triggered short covering from 200-day SMA", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.023, "main_image": "https://editorial.azureedge.net/images/Markets/Currencies/Majors/NZDUSD/new-zealand-dollars-16422943_Large.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9758, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "90688df400fde6dde4e8a5badeb19d303f13a508", "url": "https://www.fxstreet.com/news/nzd-usd-better-than-forecast-new-zealand-gdt-data-triggered-short-covering-from-200-day-sma-201904022219", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "NZD/USD: Better than forecast New Zealand GDT data triggered short covering from 200-day SMA", "text": "Upbeat GDT Price Index favored buyers from 200-day SMA support.

work on its proposed fix to 737 MAX aircraft before it can be submitted for review, US officials said Monday, suggesting the planes could stay grounded a while longer.\nAdditional work is needed \u201cto ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues,\u201d a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said in a statement.\n\u201cThe FAA will not approve the software for installation until the agency is satisfied with the submission,\u201d he added.\nRead more Boeing anti-stall system was activated in Ethiopia crash: source Daily Business Wrap - Boeing issues software update following crashes EU agency said to have skipped 737 Max meeting in snub to Boeing The FAA statement is the bureaucratic equivalent of a \u201cstop\u201d sign after Boeing officials touted their proposed remedy last week during a media tour at the company\u2019s manufacturing plant in Seattle, Washington.\nBoeing\u2019s 737 MAX planes were grounded globally last month following the second of two deadly crashes to occur in less than five months.\nScrutiny has centered on an anti-stall system developed specifically for the planes that has given pilots problems.\nA preliminary report into the second calamity \u2014 the March 10 crash of a Boeing 737 MAX 8 that killed 157 people \u2014 will likely be issued this week, the Ethiopian government said Monday.\nBoeing last week gathered hundreds of pilots and reporters at its Renton, Washington manufacturing site for a presentation on proposed changes to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which is believed to have been a key factor in the Ethiopian crash and in an October crash of a Lion Air in Indonesia that killed 189 people.\nAmong the changes, the MCAS will no longer repeatedly make corrections when the pilot tries to regain control, and will automatically disconnect in the event of disagreements between the two \u201cangle of attack,\u201d or AOA sensors, the company said last week.\nBoeing is anxious to win approval for a proposed remedy that could get the planes back in the air.\nBut the FAA, which faced harsh questioning last week at a congressional hearing regarding its oversight of Boeing, said it expected Boeing to submit the proposed fix \u201cover the coming weeks\u201d after it undertakes additional work.\nAfter that, the proposal will be submitted to a \u201crigorous safety review,\u201d the FAA spokesman said.\nPreliminary report this week Earlier Monday, Ethiopian foreign ministry spokesman Nebiat Getachew said the transport ministry would release \u201ca preliminary report into its investigation\u201d of the March 10 accident in which a Nairobi-bound Boeing 737 MAX crashed shortly after taking off from Addis Ababa.\nThe Ethiopian government gave no details on the exact timing of the release, nor hints about the report\u2019s findings.\nNebiat initially said the report would be released Monday but the transport ministry, which is in charge of investigations, later said it would still be some days.\n\u201cThe report will most likely be released some day later this week,\u201d ministry spokesman Mussie Yiheyes said.\nIt was not clear Monday if the transport ministry\u2019s preliminary report would be made public straight away, or limited to the eyes of authorities including the FAA.\nThe plane\u2019s black boxes are being examined by France\u2019s BEA air safety agency, working with American and Ethiopian investigators to determine what went wrong.\nAnti-stall system A source with knowledge of the investigation has said an anti-stalling system, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), was activated shortly before the crash.\nBoeing designed the automated MCAS system \u2014 which lowers the aircraft\u2019s nose if it detects a stall or loss of airspeed \u2014 for this particular model.\nThe same system was implicated in the October crash, with initial investigations finding that a sensor on the plane had transmitted incorrect information to the MCAS system.\nThe pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 struggled to control the aircraft as the MCAS repeatedly pushed the plane\u2019s nose down, according to the flight data recorder.\nThe pilot had tried repeatedly to regain control and pull the nose up but the plane crashed into the sea.\nBoth the planes in Indonesia and Ethiopia reportedly experienced erratic steep climbs and descents, as well as fluctuating airspeeds, before crashing shortly after takeoff.\nEthiopia has already said there were \u201cclear similarities\u201d between the two MAX 8 crashes.\nEthiopian Airlines is Africa\u2019s largest carrier and in many ways the international face of the nation.\nMore From Aviation Ethiopia to issue first Boeing investigation report

The material excesses of their closets and cars and homes grosses me out, and I don\u2019t care about their super-curated drama or celebrity or style, but the family has had me since the beginning, when Keeping Up With the Kardashians was an insecure hour on E! about a regular-if-fame-adjacent L.A. clan.\nThe trailer for the sixteenth season just dropped, and while Kim is having another baby, and Kendall seems mad about something, the main dramz is that Khloe\u2019s boyfriend, her baby\u2019s father, cheated on her with her little sister Kylie\u2019s best friend. Still, as always, they\u2019re in it together. The Kardashians sisters love and like each other and are a great inspiration for family-togetherness, writes Kate Carraway. ( instagram.com )\nThe secret of the Kardashian-Jenner\u2019s sustained, almost indomitable success, is not the canny leverage of a sex tape into an empire made of iPhone apps and lip kits, but the fact that they are a large, noisy family that both likes and loves each other. They talk to each other, about everything; they fight and make up; they travel together. While a lot of the antics on the show are super-produced in the reality-TV tradition \u2014 pranks, athletic challenges, sitcom-y misunderstandings \u2014 the best parts of the show are the scenes of the five sisters, either doing nothing and hanging out, or experiencing their fame and money and the adventures that affords, together: hotel-room antics, charity-related athletic challenges, chill family dinners and weird, wild parties.\nThe show is also aspirational for hair-extension reasons, but mostly, as a model of how to be a family: together, a lot, and doing a lot of new things. I can\u2019t think of anything I aspire to more.\nDoing new, novel things together is the best way to be together, and be happy together, in a family or a marriage or a friendship, for the long haul. When I got married, and was absorbing everything I could about how to make it work, I kept encountering the same, related ideas, over and over, across psychology and sociology and crappy listicles: experiencing new, interesting things together, is bonding. So is laughter; so is responding to \u201cbids\u201d for attention, even when you don\u2019t necessarily care about the same stuff (which is why I try so hard to listen to facts about hockey.) Article Continued Below\nWith this in mind, I\u2019m trying to get my family \u2014 fourteen people \u2014 on a pizza tour of New York. (What brings people together more than pizza? ) As the youngest grown-up in the mix, it\u2019s been my responsibility, or just obsession, to emphasize fun times together. I often feel like I missed something crucial, without the ten years everyone else in my immediate family got together, and want to make up for it. Since I was a kid, I\u2019ve organized ping-pong tournaments, White Elephant games at Christmas, and short-lived, competitive, ill-advised \u201cdetox\u201d diets. It\u2019s easy, especially when everyone is busy and tired, to do the same, familiar things which is why it\u2019s so exceedingly important to create fun with the people you know the best.\nEven when a months-long group safari isn\u2019t in the cards I think it\u2019s important to regularly encounter all of our closest people in unfamiliar, un-habitual situations. A bestie and I are hunting around for a book club, because we know every vegetarian restaurant in town inside out. My husband and I have done a lot of random whatevers, like hit up a driving range, volunteer, and adopt a nervous, sensitive dog, which sends you into an orbit of trainers and classes that, while not fun, was definitely \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cchallenging.\u201d\nWhen life is rammed, I try to meet my husband for mid-week, mid-day, super-fast coffees to spend a different kind of time together, in a different context than \u201cthe couch,\u201d to re-familiarize ourselves with each other, a process that has to happen over and over again if you want to keep a long-term relationship popping. The freshness is as enlivening as spring. (Seeing my husband in a nice, dark suit in our kitchen, and then in a nice, dark suit on Bay Street, also has a different effect .) Making an effort can feel impossible, but if you do, there might be pizza.\nKate Carraway is a Toronto-based writer and a freelance contributing columnist for the Star.

Can I still vote?\nYes, you can. The Elections Alberta website has detailed instructions for those who are planning to be out of the country on April 16, but still want to cast their ballot. Article Continued Below\nThose who will be away on election day have two options \u2014 vote at an advance polling station, or request a special ballot. Advance polling stations will run from April 9 to April 13, and for the first time, Albertans can now cast their ballot at any polling station , regardless of where their riding is located.\nIf you happen to be away during the advance voting days as well, you may vote using a special ballot. Those ballots can be requested in writing, by telephone, email, or online . They must be mailed back before 8 p.m. on April 16. Pamela Renwick, director of operations and communications at Elections Alberta, said over 8,000 special ballots have been requested so far.\nQ: United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney has spoken out about repealing Alberta\u2019s carbon tax if elected. What would happen if the provincial carbon tax is eliminated?\nIn an effort to combat climate change, the Canadian government asked each province to submit a plan for a carbon tax by Sept. 1, 2018. Provinces that missed the deadline had a federal carbon tax imposed on them beginning April 1, 2019. Alberta\u2019s NDP was one of the provincial governments that put their own carbon tax into effect, starting on Jan. 1, 2017. Under this tax right now, Albertans pay $30 per tonne on carbon emissions.\nCarbon taxes are meant to encourage households and businesses to reduce their fuel emissions. Revenue from Alberta\u2019s carbon tax is used to pay for rebates to consumers, as well as infrastructure or energy-efficiency programming. A previous report here breaks down how the carbon tax has affected Alberta households since its implementation.\nKenney has been vocal in opposition to both federal and provincial carbon taxes, saying they\u2019re \u201call economic pain and no environmental gain,\u201d despite a major United Nations report that underscored the importance of a price on carbon in combating climate change.\nIf elected, Kenney said the first bill introduced by a UCP government will be to repeal Alberta\u2019s carbon tax. Trevor Tombe, an economics professor at the University of Calgary, said this would invoke the federal carbon tax on Alberta, which is currently priced at $20 a tonne and will increase by $10 per year to $50 a tonne in 2022. Kenney said he will sue the federal government, like Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe has done , if Alberta is forced to comply with the federal carbon tax.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear what will come of a potential court action against the federal government\u2019s carbon tax.\nQ: Where do the major political parties stand on health care?\nUCP Leader Jason Kenney has made a few announcements in the last few months regarding health care. He said he plans to conduct a \u201ccomprehensive performance review\u201d on Alberta Health Services, the provincial health authority, to reallocate resources \u201caway from administration to delivery of front-line services.\u201d The review is expected to cost $2 million to $3 million.\nKenney also said he is open to allowing private clinics to \u201cbid into the public system,\u201d providing private health-care options for Albertans. He added he would \u201cmaintain or increase\u201d spending on health care if elected.\nOn the opioid crisis, Kenney said his party would impose tougher rules on supervised consumption sites , and would focus resources instead on opioid treatment centres and additional beds for detox centres to reduce wait times. He added the UCP will spend $100 million on a provincial mental health and addictions strategy, and appoint an associate minister to the file.\nThe NDP released a plan of its own, as well \u2014 promising to spend $90 million a year on to reduce surgery wait times if elected. Party leader Rachel Notley added the NDP would continue to fund emergency services so that ambulance crews could be on the street faster. Later on the campaign trail, she also announced a plan to fully cover prescription costs for low- and middle-income seniors.\nThe Alberta Party and the Alberta Liberal Party have not released comprehensive health-care platforms yet. But Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel has expressed his party\u2019s plans to instil mandatory vaccinations for children attending publicly funded schools if elected.\nQ: How much is Alberta\u2019s deficit right now, how does it differ from four years ago, and what does each party plan to do to balance the province\u2019s budget?\nThe third-quarter numbers for Alberta\u2019s budget were released in February, providing the latest update on how the province is faring financially as voters head to the polls. There is a projected $6.9-billion deficit for the 2018-2019 fiscal year. This number is lower than the projected deficit last year, which sat at around $8.8 billion.\nAt the time, finance minister Joe Ceci credited the shrinking number to higher than expected bitumen royalties. While Alberta\u2019s deficit has significantly increased under the NDP government, the province has been running negative numbers since 2008 under the Progressive Conservatives. Former premier Jim Prentice forecast a $5-billion deficit heading into the 2015 election, which was the largest to date.\nDuane Bratt, a political science professor at Mount Royal University, said the reason behind the growing deficit is a combination of both the Alberta NDP\u2019s spending policy, and the falling price of oil. Bratt said when oil was priced at $100 a barrel, the Alberta government capitalized on about $15 billion a year from resource revenues. Now, revenue from oil is around $3 billion a year.\nBoth the UCP and the NDP have released plans to balance Alberta\u2019s budget in their platforms. The NDP said it would balance the budget by 2024, and is planning to do so by relying on non-renewable resource revenue without making massive cuts to services. A detailed report on the NDP\u2019s plan can be found here.\nThe UCP said it will reach a surplus by 2023, despite plans to cut the carbon tax, which is to bring in $5.7 billion in estimated revenue over the next four years, and to lower the corporate tax by 8 per cent. Leader Jason Kenney said his party will cancel the $4-billion oil-by-rail program put forward by the NDP, and save that money instead. More on the UCP\u2019s platform can be found here.\nThe Alberta Party has not released its detailed budget plan yet, but leader Stephen Mandel said in an interview that his party also plans on balancing the budget by 2023.\nAs for the Alberta Liberal Party, it has proposed an 8 per cent provincial sales tax, and a plan to eliminate personal tax for \u201cmost Albertans,\u201d leader David Khan said. More on the Liberals\u2019 plan can be found here.\nQ: Small businesses in the province have been struggling in the face of tough economic times. What does each party plan on doing to help business get back up on their feet?\nWe\u2019ve reached out to the major parties with this question. Here are their responses:\nThe UCP said it plans on helping small business with the introduction of Bill 2: The Open for Business Act. This includes the creation of a $13 an hour minimum wage for workers who are 17 years old or younger \u201cto encourage job creators to hire young Albertans,\u201d a spokesperson for the UCP said in an email.\nThe party also plans to reverse changes made under the Alberta NDP to holiday pay \u2014 in which all eligible employers are entitled to holiday pay, regardless of whether they work the day or not. The UCP said it will return to a holiday pay qualifying period of 30 work days in the last 90 days preceding a general holiday.\nFor the NDP, the party pointed to its lowering of the small business tax rate by 33 per cent during its time in office. The tax rate for small businesses right now sits at 2 per cent. Leader Rachel Notley also announced her party will create a \u201cSmall Business Investment Office\u201d as a one-stop destination for small businesses looking to get answers or support from the provincial government.\nAlberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel said in an interview that, if elected, his party will focus on creating a \u201cpositive economic environment\u201d for small businesses in the province to succeed. This includes eliminating the carbon tax, which he said will put more money in the pockets of consumers, as well as evaluating challenges faced by small businesses today as a result of changes to the holiday pay policy, among other things.\nMandel added his party will not reverse the current $15 an hour minimum wage.\nFun facts about the April 16 election\nIt is Alberta\u2019s 30th general election, with 87 seats up for grabs in the legislature. In order to win a majority, a party needs 44 seats. There are 22 new ridings on the ballot this year \u2014 including four in Calgary, three in Edmonton, and two in Airdrie.\nIn the 2015 election, the Alberta NDP made history by breaking 44 years of rule by the Progressive Conservatives. The party\u2019s win marked the fourth change of government in the province\u2019s history.\nThe April 16 election marks the first one since the inception of the United Conservative Party (UCP) in 2017, after both the Wildrose Party and the Progressive Conservatives dissolved.\nSince the writ dropped March 19, a Mainstreet poll conducted that day finds the UCP ahead among decided voters, with 50.7 per cent of those surveyed supporting the party. The NDP is trailing behind at 37.8 per cent, but is up 10 points since January.\nDespite the NDP and the UCP holding much of the province\u2019s attention, there are actually 13 registered political parties in Alberta. Among them: the Freedom Conservative Party of Alberta, the Pro-Life Alberta Political Association, and the Communist Party of Alberta. The Wildrose Party and Progressive Conservatives remain registered as official political parties in the province.\nHave more questions?

The average family of four throws away about $1,484 worth of food and drink each year, according to its foundation.\n\"We all can do a better job to avoid wasting food,\" spokeswoman Caroline Passerrello said in an academy news release. \"Everyone can do their part by planning their meals with the foods they already have and storing leftovers properly to eat another day.\"\nReducing food waste is a good way to save money, she said.\n\"Before you go to the grocery store, check your refrigerator,\" Passerrello suggested. \"You'll often be surprised at what meals you can whip up with the foods you already have.\"\nAnother way to reduce waste: Know what the dates on food packaging mean.\nThe \"sell by\" date tells the store when it should stop selling an item for inventory control purposes, while the \"best if used by\" date is when the product is past its peak quality.\nNeither date reflects a product's safety, but some people think that's so and throw away perfectly good food.\n\"However, if you have any doubts about the food's safety, don't eat it,\" Passerrello said.\nMake the most of leftovers. Wrap and refrigerate right away to avoid contamination. Don't eat foods that have been left out for two hours, or one hour during warmer temperatures.\nFreeze leftovers that you don't plan to eat within a few days. \"Wrap items in heavy freezer paper, plastic wrap, freezer bags or foil. Date all frozen items and use the oldest first when planning your next meal,\" Passerrello said.\nMore information\nThe Natural Resources Defense Council has more on food waste .\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 HealthDay .

They are next scheduled to appear on May 13 for a status conference before Judge Edward J Davila, US District Judge.\nIf convicted, the defendants face a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution if appropriate for each violation.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kishore dattapuram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kumar aswapathi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aswapathi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nanoseman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santosh giri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dattapuram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giri", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "united states citizenship and immigration services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa clara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san jose", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T02:50:22.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "08b51ba935586aec8a05e4a938d42e65b8a526ac", "url": "https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/04/02/us_customs_mozilla_cto/", "site_full": "www.theregister.co.uk", "site": "theregister.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.theregister.co.uk/headlines.rss", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "The Register", "title": "Ex-Mozilla CTO: I was grilled for three hours at San Francisco airport by US border cops \u2013 and I'm an American citizen", "title_full": "Ex-Mozilla CTO: I was grilled for three hours at San Francisco airport by US border cops \u2013 and I'm an American citizen \u2022 The Register", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://regmedia.co.uk/2016/06/27/us_border_agent.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 4611, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 476, "comments": 156, "shares": 267}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "08b51ba935586aec8a05e4a938d42e65b8a526ac", "url": "https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/04/02/us_customs_mozilla_cto/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Shaun Nichols in San Francisco", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ex-Mozilla CTO: I was grilled for three hours at San Francisco airport by US border cops \u2013 and I'm an American citizen", "text": "SHARE \u25bc\nFormer Mozilla CTO Andreas Gal says he was interrogated for three hours by America's border cops after arriving at San Francisco airport \u2013 because he refused to unlock his work laptop and phone.\nGal, now employed by Apple, today claimed he was detained and grilled on November 29 after landing in California following a trip to Europe.\nHe had attempted to pass through US customs via a Global Entry electronic kiosk. He wasn't expecting a problem, since the Hungarian-born techie is now an American citizen, but it was not to be.\n\"On this trip, the kiosk directed me to a Customs and Border Patrol agent who kept my passport and sent me to secondary inspection,\" Gal said. \"There I quickly found myself surrounded by three armed agents wearing bullet proof vests. They started to question me aggressively regarding my trip, my current employment, and my past work for Mozilla, a non-profit organization dedicated to open technology and online privacy.\"\nGal said the g-men were rather interested in his time at Firefox-maker Mozilla, and of his recent trip to Canada. They also went through his wallet and luggage, and this led to a request by the agents for Gal to unlock his Apple-issued iPhone XS and MacBook Pro, it is claimed.\nGiven the devices were emblazoned with big red stickers reading \"PROPERTY OF APPLE. PROPRIETARY,\" and he had signed confidentially agreements with Cupertino, Gal said he asked for permission to call his bosses and/or a lawyer to see if he would get into trouble by handing over access. When this request was repeatedly refused, we're told, he clammed up, taking the Fifth, and citing constitutional rights against unwarranted searches.\nIrked by Gal's refusal, it is claimed, the border agents told him he had no constitutional nor any legal protections, and threatened him with criminal charges should he not concede to the search. He said he was eventually allowed to leave with his belongings, the devices still locked, and no charges were pressed. Gal said the agents did take away his Global Entry pass, which allows express entry through customs, as punishment for not complying with their demands. How random is random?\nGal believes the ordeal was not a random search gone awry, but rather a targeted attempt by the government to send a message. Certainly more and more security researchers report being grilled by US border patrol, if they can even get a visa to enter the country, that is.\n\"My past work on encryption and online privacy is well documented, and so is my disapproval of the Trump administration and my history of significant campaign contributions to Democratic candidates,\" Gal noted. \"I wonder whether these CBP [Customs and Border Patrol] programs led to me being targeted.\" US border cops told to stop copying people's files just for the hell of it READ MORE\nNow, Gal has enlisted the help of the ACLU to probe into the brouhaha, and determine whether his civil rights were violated. The civil-liberties watchdog has filed a complaint [PDF] with the Department of Homeland security to determine whether the search violated the US Constitution and demand an investigation of whether the CBP's entry policies are illegal.\n\"CBP's baseless detention and intrusive interrogation of Andreas Gal and the attempted search of his devices violated his Fourth Amendment rights,\" ACLU Northern California senior counsel William Freeman said of the complaint.\n\"Furthermore, CBP\u2019s policies lack protections for First Amendment rights by allowing interrogation and device searches that may be based on a traveler\u2019s political beliefs, activism, nation of origin, or identity.\"\n\"As a matter of policy CBP can\u2019t comment on pending litigation,\" CBP told The Register . \u00ae", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.aclunc.org/docs/ACLU-NC_2019-03-28_Letter_re._Electronic_Device_Search_SFO.pdf", "https://medium.com/@andreasgal/no-one-should-have-to-travel-in-fear-b2bff4c460e5"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "former mozilla cto andreas gal", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gal", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "customs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mozilla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "border patrol", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mozilla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T03:02:05.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "61c1ba9b972ac2004fc4f3602c008616af738c4e", "url": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2019-04-02-the-raconteurs-officially-announce-new-album-help-us-stranger/", "site_full": "www.iheart.com", "site": "iheart.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "The Raconteurs Officially Announce New Album 'Help Us Stranger' | 100.1 WKQQ", "title_full": "The Raconteurs Officially Announce New Album 'Help Us Stranger' | 100.1 WKQQ", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5ca3d68a640b3a3114736c48", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1524, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "61c1ba9b972ac2004fc4f3602c008616af738c4e", "url": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2019-04-02-the-raconteurs-officially-announce-new-album-help-us-stranger/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Raconteurs Officially Announce New Album 'Help Us Stranger' | 100.1 WKQQ", "text": "The Raconteurs Officially Announce New Album 'Help Us Stranger' posted by Katrina Nattress - Apr 2, 2019\nWhen The Raconteurs released two new songs in December, we knew it was only a matter of time until they officially announced their third album.
