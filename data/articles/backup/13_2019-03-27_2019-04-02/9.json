Activity in the services sector to highlight Wednesday, with updates for all major economies. The USD/JPY pair ended the day unchanged in the 111.30 price zone, having spent the day consolidating Monday gains. The absence of relevant macroeconomic news coming from Japan at the beginning of the day and the poor performance of Asian equities kept the pair ranging, while later on the day, dollar's strength offset equities' declines. In the meantime, US Treasury yields eased just modestly, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note spending the day in the 2.47/9% range. Early Wednesday, the Japanese Nikkei Services PMI is expected to come in at 52.1, slightly below the previous 52.3. Local share markets may follow the lead of Wall Street in its way lower and somehow pressure the pair. The daily chart shows that, for a second consecutive day, the pair was unable to surpass a flat 200 DMA at around 111.45, holding, however, above the longer ones. The pair also held above the 61.8% retracement of its March slide at around 111.20. The 4 hours offers a neutral-to-bullish stance as the pair keeps developing above all of its moving averages, and with the 20 SMA crossing above the larger ones, while technical indicators eased just modestly within positive levels.\nSupport levels: 111.20 110.90 111.55\nResistance levels: 111.70 112.05 112.40 View Live Chart for the USD/JPY\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

On the other hand, the consensus forecasts are calling for Australia's February month balance of trade to flash a soft figure of $3.8 billion AUD, down from the last reading of AUD 4,549 million. The Australian exports in January last came in at +5.0%, while Imports for the same period arrived at +3.0%.\nWhile latest reports on retail sales and trade balance were positive, various banks have their own forecasts for the current data ahead of the release.\nWestpac seems upbeat on trade balance but not the same while looking at retail sales. It says,\nConsensus is for a pickup to 0.3%mth in Feb but Westpac is on a gloomy -0.1%, given poor consumer sentiment, including survey detail showing elevated risk aversion. The industry breakdown in Jan also concerned us, with poor sales in discretionary categories.\nAustralia\u2019s trade balance is a much more positive story. Dec 2018 and Jan 2019 were the second- and third-largest surpluses on record, with Jan A$4.5bn. We look for -0.9%mth on exports, as falls in gold and coal offset gains for iron ore, while imports may have risen 1.1%, led by fuel. This would trim the surplus to a still historically very large $3.8bn. The median forecast is $3.7bn.\nOn the other hand, TD Securities has its own belief as follows:\nRetail sales are expected to lift by 0.2%. After the recent Dec qtr private consumption report revealed that spending tended to be on services and no net spending on goods, we don\u2019t expect a lot of growth in this report. The February trade surplus is expected to be relatively steady at +$A4.9b. We expected exports to correct by -1.5%/m after the surprise blockbuster +6.2%/m in Jan, while imports pullback by a decent -3%/m taking the signal from the Chinese trade report, showing a holiday slump in exports to Australia in February (that is not quite seasonally adjusted away).\nHow could they affect the AUD/USD?\nWhile recently positive data from China and optimism surrounding the US-China trade deal haven\u2019t been highlighted by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), traders might take serious note of the scheduled data if negative outcomes arrive.\nTechnically, the AUD/USD pair can take rest around 0.7050 in case of soft data but further weakness beneath the same support could drag the quote towards 0.7015 and 0.6980 important rest-points. Alternatively, 0.7075 and 50-day simple moving average (SMA) around 0.7120 can act as immediate resistances for the buyers to watch in case of positive data.\nKey Notes\nAUD/USD Analysis: RBA weighed the Aussie, China can save it\nAbout the Australian retail sales\nThe Retail Sales released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics is a survey of goods sold by retailers is based on a sampling of retail stores of different types and sizes and it's considered as an indicator of the pace of the Australian economy. It shows the performance of the retail sector over the short and mid-term. Positive economic growth anticipates bullish trends for the AUD, while a low reading is seen as negative or bearish.\nAbout the Australian trade balance\nThe trade balance released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics is the difference in the value of its imports and exports of Australian goods. Export data can give an important reflection of Australian growth, while imports provide an indication of domestic demand. Trade Balance gives an early indication of the net export performance. If a steady demand in exchange for Australian exports is seen, that would turn into a positive growth in the trade balance, and that should be positive for the AUD.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Wall Street's decline added pressure on the AUD at the end of the day.\nThe AUD/USD pair fell to 0.7052, its lowest in three weeks, following RBA's monetary policy announcement. The central bank left the cash rate unchanged at 1.5% as expected, although the wording in the accompanying statement had a dovish tilt that heightened expectations of a rate cut, the main reason behind Aussie weakness. Policymakers acknowledged softer economic growth, removing their forecast of local growth of around 3.0% for this year. \"Further progress in reducing unemployment and having inflation return to target is expected, although this progress is likely to be gradual,\" said Governor Lowe, who said that monetary policy would be set to support sustainable growth. Another dovish turn was seen in the language about the labor market, as despite improvement there remains strong, policymakers now expect wages growth to be a \"gradual process.\"\nSome encouraging headlines related to US-China trade talks failed to boost the pair. A US official said that, at this point, \"a deal is more likely to go forward than not.\" The Australian macroeconomic calendar will be quite busy, as the country will release the AIG Performance of Services Index for March, previously at 44.5, February Retail Sales, seen up by 0.2%, and February trade data, with the monthly surplus forecast at 3,800M. China will release the Caixin Services PMI, foreseen at 52.3 vs. the previous 51.1. This last has more chances of moving AUD/USD than local data.\nThe pair bounced just modestly from the mentioned low, maintaining the sour tone ahead of the Asian opening as it hovers around 0.7060. In the 4 hours chart , the bearish case is firming up, as the price is now below all of its moving averages, while the Momentum indicator maintains a strong bearish slope well below its midline, as the RSI hovers around 28 without directional strength.\nSupport levels: 0.7055 0.7020 0.6980\nResistance levels: 0.7090 0.7130 0.7170\nView Live Chart for the AUD/USD\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

The study, based on over 300,000 respondents between 2002 and 2013, shows that seasonal allergic rhinitis, or hay fever, increases when the timing of spring \u201cgreenup\u201d changes. The findings were published today in the journal PLOS ONE .\nHay fever, or \u201cseasonal allergic rhinitis,\u201d affects 25 million adults in the United States and results in $11.2 billion in related medical expenses annually.\nCredit: UMD \u201cWe found that areas where the onset of spring was earlier than normal had 14% higher prevalence of hay fever,\u201d said Associate Professor Amir Sapkota in the Maryland Institute for Applied Environmental Health. \u201cSurprisingly, we also found similar risk in areas where the onset of spring was much later than what is typical for that geographic location,\u201d he added.\nThe study provides the first national-level quantitative data showing how ongoing climate change is increasing the allergic disease burden in the United States. Hay fever, or \u201cseasonal allergic rhinitis,\u201d affects 25 million adults in the United States and results in $11.2 billion in related medical expenses annually.\nDr. Sapkota and his team used satellite data collected by NASA\u2019s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to identify the start of the spring season throughout the US and linked these data to National Health Interview Survey data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\u201cPrevious studies have shown that plant phenology is highly dependent on temperature. As such, it is one of the most sensitive indicators of how our ecosystem is responding to climate change,\u201d said Dr. Chengsheng Jiang, co-author of the paper. \u201cWe show that such climate change-driven ecological changes are directly linked to allergic disease burden in the United States. Even a relatively small change in the timing of tree flowering can have a significant economic impact given that 25 million American adults already suffer from hay fever each year.\u201d\nThe reason for increased hay fever when spring arrives early seems to be related to pollen exposure. An earlier onset of spring means trees flower sooner and create a longer season for tree pollen, which is the major source of spring seasonal allergens. But a very late onset of spring may mean many species of trees simultaneously burst in bloom, blasting allergy sufferers with a high concentration of pollen for a shorter duration.\nDr. Sapkota suggests this is yet another example of how climate change is impacting burden of allergic disease right here in our backyard. Given that climate change is projected to intensify, Dr. Sapkota argues such data are critical to inform public health adaptation strategies, including early warning systems. \u201cClimate change impacts our health in more ways than we can imagine. We need community-specific adaptation strategies to increase resilience and minimize disease burden associated with climate change,\u201d he urged.\n Contacts and sources:\nAmir Sapkota, Chengsheng Jiang\nUniversity of Maryland Citation: .
