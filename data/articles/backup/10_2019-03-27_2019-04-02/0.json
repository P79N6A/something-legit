By PTI\nDUBAI: The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has approved a new rule for expats under which foreign workers will now be able to sponsor their family members if they fulfil a certain income criteria, a move which will benefit lakhs of Indians.\nIndians in the UAE constitute the largest part of population of the country.\nApproximately 3.3 million non-resident Indians constitute about 30 per cent of the total population of the UAE, according to the Indian Embassy in the UAE.\nIncome will be the only requirement for UAE expatriates to sponsor their family members as opposed to the previously listed 'professions', the UAE Cabinet announced on Sunday as it adopted a decision to amend provisions of the resolution on foreign workers sponsoring their families.\nThe Cabinet made the decision to reaffirms the UAE's position \"as a hub for talents and a land of opportunities\", the Khaleej Times reported.\nUnder the prevalent guidelines, male expats can sponsor their immediate family members such as wife and children if he earns a monthly salary of Dh 4,000 (approximately Rs 75,000) or Dh 3,000 (Rs 56,000) plus accommodation provided by his company.\nHe also had to be employed in certain categories for him to be eligible to sponsor his family.\nFor example, domestic helpers and certain other categories were not entitled to sponsor their families irrespective of their monthly income, the report said. The UAE Cabinet approves new facilitation for expats sponsoring family members and reaffirms UAE\u2019s position as a hub for talents and the land of opportunities. #UAEGov pic.twitter.com/SFPI8TSDkI \u2014 UAEGov (@uaegov) March 31, 2019\nSimilarly, a female resident could sponsor her family only if she was a teacher, engineer or a health professional and earned Dh 4,000 per month.\nIf she worked in any other sector, she needed to have a minimum monthly salary of Dh 10,000 (Rs 1.88 lakhs) and a special approval from the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs.\nThe latest Cabinet announcement has done away with the requirement for residents to have certain professions.\nHowever, it was not immediately clear if there are any changes to the salary requirements.\nAccording to a UAE Cabinet statement, \"The decision aims at enhancing family stability of foreign workers and social cohesion, as well as attracting highly skilled workers while maintaining a healthy balance between professional and personal lives.\" Stay up to date on all the latest World news with The New Indian Express App. Download now (Get the news that matters from New Indian Express on WhatsApp. Click this link and hit 'Click to Subscribe' .

More Verizon Communications (VZ) closed at $59.07 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.11% move from the prior day. This change lagged the S&P 500's 1.16% gain on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 1.27%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 1.29%. Heading into today, shares of the largest U.S. cellphone carrier had gained 3.88% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.18% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.92% in that time. VZ will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be April 23, 2019. On that day, VZ is projected to report earnings of $1.17 per share, which would represent no growth from the year-ago period. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $32.26 billion, up 1.55% from the year-ago period. VZ's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.66 per share and revenue of $132.29 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -1.06% and +1.09%, respectively. Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for VZ. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.

The AP reported :\nThe Trump administration is considering bringing on a \u201cborder\u201d or \u201cimmigration czar\u201d to coordinate the president\u2019s immigration policies across various federal agencies, according to three people familiar with the discussions.\nTrump is weighing two potential candidates for the post: Former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach and former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli \u2014 two far-right conservatives with strong views on immigration, according to the people, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the conversations publicly.\nHowever, the report does not say if the appointee would be responsible for the border only or for the much broader issue of immigration, which includes visa workers, legal immigration, deportations, and much else. The AP described the job vaguely either as \u201ca \u2018border\u2019 or \u2018immigration czar.'\u201d\nThe leak may be designed to rally opposition to the proposal by pairing it with two advocates who are strongly opposed by the business wing of the GOP. Kobach is a strong supporter of Trump, but he is opposed by business groups that support a large-scale inflow of foreign workers. In 2013, Cuccinelli narrowly lost his race for Virginia governor after the Republican National Committee provided him little funding.\nIn the White House, Trump does not have a deputy to daily push his goals and to coordinate the agencies\u2019 rival priorities. As Trump deals with many top-level issues, his competing deputies tend to dominate low-priority debates. For example, Trump\u2019s deputies sidelined his demand for border funding during congressional budget talks in 2017 and 2018. According to the Wall Street Journal :\nIn March [2018], Congress completed a $1.3 trillion spending package, but included just $1.6 billion for a border barrier, with most of the money intended to replace existing fencing. It banned the money from being spent on concrete slabs or any other of the wall prototypes the White House was considering.\nUpset there wasn\u2019t more money for the wall, Mr. Trump threatened to veto it. At an emergency meeting at the White House with his staff and Republican leaders, Mr. Trump learned that the spending bill incorporated all of the border wall money that was requested in the White House budget proposal.\n\u201cWho the f\u2014 put that in my request?\u201d Mr. Trump shouted.\nA top-level coordinator is also needed because immigration issues are divided among several agencies.\nFor example, visas are reviewed and approved by the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State.\nRequests for workers are approved by the Department of Labor, DHS, and the state department.\nAsylum requests are processed by DHS and the justice department.\nThe flow of \u201cUnaccompanied Alien Children\u201d is managed by DHS and the Department of Health and Human Services.\nLawsuits and appeals involving immigration are handled by the Justice Department.\nThe border wall is being managed by the Pentagon\u2019s Corps of Engineers and the DHS.\nA White House czar \u201ccould work, but it is often a bureaucratic way to be seen as doing something,\u201d said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. \u201cIt is probably is a good idea to have one person oversee all the immigration stuff \u2026 but if you just have a border czar, I\u2019m not sure how useful that is.\u201d\nThe czar\u2019s personal authority could be weak or strong, he said. \u201cIt certainly could not hurt \u2014 but it would depend on who it was and how much juice that person had compared to other people in the administration.\u201d Also, he said, the czar \u201cshould be somebody who does nothing but immigration,\u201d he added.\nThe ideological priorities of the person for the job are critical, he said. \u201cThe fact is that we have a DHS Secretary [Kirstjen Nielsen] who does not agree with the administration \u2026 Clearly, if there was a DHS Secretary who actually shared the administration\u2019s professsed goals on immigration, of tightening up the labor market as well as enforcing the border, that would help.\u201d\nEach year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or university. But the federal government then imports approximately 1.1 million legal immigrants, refreshes a resident population of roughly 1.5 million white-collar guest workers and roughly 500,000 blue-collar visa workers, and also tolerates about eight million illegal workers.\nThis federal policy of flooding the market with cheap white-collar graduates and blue-collar foreign labor is intended to boost economic growth for investors. This policy shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors, widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts children\u2019s schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\nGoldman Sachs says Trump's tight labor-market policy (AKA 'Hire American') gave 4% raise to blue-collar/middle-class in 2018. But upper-income graduate salaries lagged \u2013 maybe b/c of 1.5 million visa-worker graduates who work for spaghettiOs & green cards https://t.co/g6jtv9BS81\n\u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 14, 2019\nEconomy Immigration Politics asylum Border Wall Corps of Engineers Department of Health and Human Services department of homeland security Department of Justice Department of Labor Department of State Donald Trump Kirstjen Nielsen Migrant unaccompanied alien children visa workers", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/a-ticking-time-bomb-ms-13-threatens-a-middle-school-warn-teachers-parents-students/2018/06/11/7cfc7036-5a00-11e8-858f-12becb4d6067_story.html?utm_term=.8427cedf78fd", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-promised-to-build-that-wall-then-ran-out-of-time-and-options-11550262854?ns=prod/accounts-wsj", "https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-715222-1", "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/font-awesome@4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css", "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/immigrant-surge-pressures-distant-cities/", "https://media.brei", "https://www.googletagservices.com/tag/js/gpt.js", "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/animate.css@3.5.2/animate.min.css", "https://twitter.com/NeilMunroDC/status/1106196559878938630?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.edpolicyinca.org/blog/how-does-language-mix-students-affect-student-achievement", "https://twitter.com/NeilMunroDC/status/1101926420987760640", "https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/07/social-mobility-america/491240/", "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/trump-clinton-immigration-economy-unemployment-jobs-214216", "https://apnews.com/40654a1b83eb45e3b661903305083d9e"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ken cuccinelli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kris kobach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T02:47:13.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ba4c0b0fd269194535402e609061210944a6005b", "url": "https://paultan.org/2017/09/13/bmw-m8-gte-race-car-previews-production-model", "site_full": "paultan.org", "site": "paultan.org", "site_section": "https://paultan.org/topics/special/2017-frankfurt-motor-show/page/2/", "site_categories": ["vehicles", "business"], "section_title": "2017 Frankfurt Motor Show Archives - Page 2 of 5 - Paul Tan's Automotive News", "title": "BMW M8 GTE race car previews production model", "title_full": "BMW M8 GTE race car previews production model", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "news", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s2.paultan.org/image/2017/09/P90276602_highRes-e1505280435201-1200x631.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3936, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 187, "comments": 1, "shares": 8}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ba4c0b0fd269194535402e609061210944a6005b", "url": "https://paultan.org/2017/09/13/bmw-m8-gte-race-car-previews-production-model", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jonathan Lee", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "BMW M8 GTE race car previews production model", "text": "The new BMW 8 Series may not even be in production yet \u2013 let alone the high-performance M8 \u2013 but Munich is getting the ball rolling with a racing version of the upcoming luxury coup\u00e9. The BMW M8 GTE will be campaigned in international GT racing next year ahead of the road car\u2019s launch.\nIt will be entered in the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC), the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC) and the 24 Hours of Le Mans, where BMW hopes it will fight for victory. The car will make its official race debut at the 24 Hours of Daytona on January 27.\nVisually, the M8 GTE looks to be faithful to the Concept 8 Series , with slim headlights that feature hexagonal corona rings, flanking massive trapezoidal kidney grilles that are joined in the middle. The long, rakish silhouette also remains, as do the L-shaped tail lights.\nOn top the production-ready body, BMW Motorsport has fitted a swathe of aerodynamic addenda to make the M8 fit for racing. These include boxy flared fenders to hide the wider track, sizeable air intakes and bonnet vents, additional lighting for night racing, streamlined door mirrors, a massive rear diffuser and the obligatory rear wing. The livery was designed specifically for the car\u2019s Frankfurt Motor Show debut.\nUnder the bonnet is the M8\u2019s twin-turbocharged V8 (likely the new M5 \u2018s 4.4 litre unit) albeit downsized to 4.0 litres to meet GTE regulations \u2013 it makes a nominal output of over 500 hp, depending on the classification. Drive is sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed sequential manual transmission.\nExtensive use of carbon fibre components mitigates the M8 GTE\u2019s considerable girth \u2013 despite being nearly five metres long (4,980 mm) and over two metres wide (2,046 mm), it weighs just 1,220 kg. The company says that it made extensive use of virtual development, with 3D printing giving engineers greater freedom and rapid prototyping allowing for a 24-hour turnaround to create a usable prototype component.\nThe team also used new algorithm to create more computational flow dynamics (CFD) calculations, enabling greater computing power to increase the number of simulations before using the wind tunnel \u2013 the aero wheels you see here is one of the products of this development. The use of 3D measurement technology, first used on this year\u2019s M4 DTM , also ensures perfect quality control once the hand-built car is assembled.\nThe M8 road car, which will be developed in concert with the race programme, will likely feature the new M5\u2019s 600 hp/750 Nm V8 powertrain, plus that car\u2019s eight-speed automatic transmission and an M xDrive all-wheel drive system with a drift-happy rear-wheel drive mode.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mun", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "imsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "le mans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bmw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bmw motorsport", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "daytona", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T05:38:51.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b0f0e5e5fcc832e088b78ed8b423e71732a00721", "url": "https://www.thenational.ae/world/gcc/iran-and-iraq-put-visa-waiver-agreements-into-effect-in-a-loss-to-baghdad-1.843918", "site_full": "www.thenational.ae", "site": "thenational.ae", "site_section": "https://www.thenational.ae/international", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "International - The National", "title": "Iran and Iraq put visa waiver agreements into effect in a loss to Baghdad", "title_full": "Iran and Iraq put visa waiver agreements into effect in a loss to Baghdad - The National", "published": "2019-04-01T09:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.thenational.ae/image/policy:1.843917:1554130689/image.jpg?f=16x9&q=0.6&w=1200&$p$f$q$w=70c86c9", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9696, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b0f0e5e5fcc832e088b78ed8b423e71732a00721", "url": "https://www.thenational.ae/world/gcc/iran-and-iraq-put-visa-waiver-agreements-into-effect-in-a-loss-to-baghdad-1.843918", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "thenational.ae", "published": "2019-04-01T09:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Iran and Iraq put visa waiver agreements into effect in a loss to Baghdad", "text": "The Iranian embassy in Baghdad has announced that it will waive all visa fees for Iraqis looking to visit Iran starting on Monday.\nIt is a reciprocal measure that will leave Baghdad at a loss, with millions more Iranians visiting Iraq every year than Iraqis going the other way.\nThe move comes as part of Tehran\u2019s efforts to warm ties with Baghdad after the US administration of President Donald Trump imposed an embargo and sanctions after Washington pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal.\nIt comes after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s trip to Iraq last month, which saw the two countries restore the 1975 Algiers Agreement as part of a drive to improve relations and to deal with border disputes along the Shatt Al Arab waterway.\nThe agreement also made pledges to make tourism, pilgrimage and commerce visas free to citizens of both countries starting from April 1.

Read on for advice on UK work visas and the application requirements\u2026 Working in the UK during your studies\nIf you\u2019d like to find part-time work while studying in the UK, you\u2019ll need to be aware of the requirements and restrictions that apply to students from your country:\nStudents from the EU, EEA, or Switzerland\nIf you\u2019re from a country within the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, you can work in the UK while studying, without any restrictions or permissions. You should be prepared to show your passport or identity card to your employer to prove you\u2019re an EU national, and should apply for a National Insurance number (scroll to the end of this article for details).\nStudents from outside the EU\nIf you\u2019re a student from outside the EU, you\u2019ll most likely be in the UK on a Tier 4 (General) student visa , which will tell you the number of hours you can work during term-time. If you\u2019re attending a publicly funded UK university at degree level or above, or taking part in a study abroad program at an overseas higher education institution, you can work for up to 20 hours per week during term-time and full-time during the Christmas and Easter breaks.\nYou can\u2019t work if you\u2019re attending a private university (of which there are only five in the country) or a publicly funded college. If you\u2019re aged 16 or 17 or studying below degree level, you are only permitted to work for up to 10 hours per week during term-time. You can have more than one employer as long as you don\u2019t go beyond the 10/20 hours per week limit.\nTime spent completing a permitted work placement as part of your studies will not count as part of your 10 or 20 hours. However, any work placements must not take up more than a third of your total study time \u2013 or half if you\u2019re studying at an overseas higher education institute or on a Tier 4 (Child) visa.\nYou can take up most types of employment, but cannot be self-employed or work in business activity, a role as an entertainer or professional sportsperson (including sports coach), or any permanent full-time position, unless it\u2019s on a recognized foundation program or as a students\u2019 union sabbatical officer. You can work full-time after finishing your degree as long as your visa status is still valid and you don\u2019t work in a permanent position, self-employed, as a doctor or any of the other prohibited roles mentioned above. Working in the UK after graduation\nStudents from the EU, EEA, or Switzerland\nStudents from the EU/EEA and Switzerland are entitled to work and stay in the UK without the need for a visa \u2013 so far there have been no changes to this following the UK\u2019s referendum on membership of the EU . If the UK withdraws from the existing freedom of movement agreement, future EU students may need to apply for visas for study and post-graduation employment.\nStudents from outside the EU/EEA\nThere are various visa schemes open for non-EU students to remain and work in the UK after completing their studies. The Start Up Visa , which will replace the Tier 1 (Graduate Entrepreneur) visa in July 2019, is intended for people outside the EU and Switzerland who want to start their own business in the UK. To apply for this visa, you\u2019ll need to get endorsement from an authorized body , which can be a UK university. You could also be endorsed by the Sirius Programme . You\u2019ll need to pay a fee for this visa, as well as the healthcare surcharge to access the National Health Service (NHS). If your application is successful, you can stay in the UK for two years.\nHowever, the most popular way to gain a UK work visa is through the Tier 2 (General) visa , which is for skilled workers from outside the EEA and Switzerland who have a job offer to work in the UK. To be eligible, the job will usually need to have a salary of at least \u00a320,800 (~US$27,300) per year, although there are some roles excluded from this.\nTo switch from the Tier 4 Student Visa to the Tier 2 visa, you\u2019ll need to have successfully gained a degree from a licensed Tier 4 sponsor . You must be applying from inside the UK and apply before your current visa expires.\nOther eligibility requirements and documents needed include: Evidence that you can support yourself financially \u2013 you must prove with bank statements that you have at least \u00a3945 (~US$1,240) in your account for 90 days before you apply, or a certificate of sponsorship if applicable. A certificate of sponsorship from a licensed sponsor. Proof that you can speak English to the required level, unless you\u2019re from a country where this is not required (list here ). Biometric information (fingerprints and a photograph). Current passport. Tuberculosis test results if you\u2019re from a country where this is required . A criminal record certificate (if you\u2019re working with vulnerable people).\nTo apply, you\u2019ll need to pay the appropriate visa charge and healthcare surcharge for yourself and any dependents . If your application is successful, you can stay in the UK with a Tier 2 (General) visa for a maximum of 5 years and 14 days, or the time given on your certificate of sponsorship plus one month, whichever is shorter. Your stay must start no more than 14 days before the start date on your certificate of sponsorship. After five years, you can apply for a permanent residency card.\nIf you\u2019d prefer to work in the UK for a shorter period, you could apply for the Tier 5 (Temporary Worker - Government Authorised Exchange) visa , which is for those undertaking work experience or training programs. The requirements for this are similar \u2013 you\u2019ll need \u00a3945 in savings and a certificate of sponsorship from your UK sponsor (your employer). This UK work visa allows you to stay in the country for 12 or 24 months, depending on which scheme you apply for. National Insurance numbers\nEveryone who wants to work in the UK will need a National Insurance (NI) number, a unique code which is used to track your tax payments and contributions to the UK\u2019s social security system. This is free to obtain \u2013 you\u2019ll need to apply by phone as soon as possible, and can only do so in the UK. You should have your passport/visa information to hand when you call.\nThe NI number will take around four weeks to be issued, and depending on your visa status, you might be asked to attend an interview. You can start work without a NI number but will need to prove to your employer that you\u2019ve applied for it and give them the number once it\u2019s issued. If you have a biometric residence permit (BRP) you may already have a NI number printed on the back, so you won\u2019t need to apply for another one.\nThis article was originally published in December 2016.

Whether you want to work or simply visit the UAE, several visas are available that can suit your travel plans. While the country issues many other kinds of visas, we're just going to talk about the most common ones. Below are five visas one can use to enter the UAE. Tourist visa As it says on the tin, a tourist visa is used by travellers whose purpose in the country is for tourism. The visa permits the holder to stay in the country for 30 days. To get one, you'll need sponsorship by a UAE airline, hotel and tour operators. Each UAE airline offers visa services when you fly with them. Apart from that, travel agents and hotels can also arrange a tourist visa for you. Visit visa You'll need a friend or relative residing in the country to sponsor your UAE visit visa. They can apply for your visa at any GDRFA office across the emirate and the process takes a few days. After the visa is issued, your sponsor should send you a copy of your permit through fax or email. He should submit the original permit to the airport. When you arrive at the airport, you can collect it from there. It is necessary for you to receive a copy of your entry permit before you leave your country. Transit visa Have a connecting flight with a lengthy stopover? If you're just passing by, UAE airlines also issue transit visas valid for those whose stopover exceeds 8 hours. Passengers with transit visas must leave the country within 96 hours of arrival. If you have a shorter transit time, worry not! Dubai Airports recently proposed that transit passengers may soon be able to experience the city as part of the Dubai 10X initiative.

It's valid for two months from the date of issuance and you'll need one if you're looking to work in the UAE. As of late February, residents who are changing jobs in the UAE will no longer need a good conduct certificate for the visa if they are in the country. Residence visa The residence visa is the next step after securing an employment visa. Think of it as an evolution of the latter. To secure this, you'll need to get a medical test and apply for another document - the Emirates ID. The UAE Resident Identity Card certifies that the holder is a valid UAE resident. After the whole process is complete, you can now sponsor your family members and bring them into the country as well.

Millions come to UAE from around the world every year. Be it as a tourist or to settle in the country as an expat, the number of visa applications received by UAE authorities every year is phenomenal. Applying for a visit or work visa is a hassle-free process that requires you to fill an application form and provide the necessary documents - scanned copies of your passport, invitation letter from a host in UAE, return tickets (for tourist visa), among others. Please check with your travel agency or company PRO for more details. While it is a seamless process, there are times when the visa may be rejected. Below are the most common reasons: 1. If you held a residence visa previously and left the country without cancelling the UAE visa. To get an approval, the PRO will have to go to the immigration department and clear your previous residency visa. 2. Hand written passports will automatically get rejected by the UAE Immigration. 3. Visa applicants with previous criminal offence, fraud or misconduct committed in the UAE. 4. Previously applied for tourist visa but did not enter the country. In order to get an approval, PRO of the travel agency or sponsor must go to the immigration to clear the previous UAE visa. 5. Applicants who applied for employment visa via a company (prospective employer) but did not enter the country. To get an approval, the PRO of a travel agency or sponsor must go to the UAE immigration and clear the previous employment visa. 6. Visa application with typo errors of name, passport number, and profession code will see a delay in getting approval, or result in rejection of the passport. 7. When photo of the passport copies are not clear or blurred when applied in the online UAE immigration system, the approval might get delayed or rejected. NOTE: Visa rules are subject to changes. Follow UAE embassy in your country or the relevant authority in the UAE.

Share Via Email Published: 02nd April 2019 11:08 AM | Last Updated: 02nd April 2019 11:08 AM | A+ A A- For representational purposes By PTI WASHINGTON: Three Indian-origin consultants have been charged in the US with visa fraud for allegedly submitting sham applications for H-1B visas to gain a competitive advantage over competing firms.\nA federal grand jury last month indicted Kishore Dattapuram, of Santa Clara, Kumar Aswapathi, of Austin, Texas, and Santosh Giri, of San Jose, on 10 counts of substantive visa fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud, the Justice Department said in a statement.\nThe H-1B visa programme allows foreign workers to obtain temporary authorisation to live and work for employers in the United States.\nIn order to secure an H-1B visa, an employer or other sponsor must submit an 'I-129' petition to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.\nA petition and associated documentation must confirm the existence and duration of the job waiting for the worker, and describe key details including the wages associated with the position.\nAccording to the eight-page indictment, Dattapuram, 49, Aswapathi, 49, and Giri, 42 operated Nanosemantics, Inc, a Santa Clara-based consulting firm whose services included placing skilled foreign workers at software and technology companies in the Bay Area.\nThey worked together to submit fraudulent H-1B visa applications on behalf of foreign workers in order to gain a competitive advantage over competing firms.\nThe defendants allegedly used Nanosemantics to submit fraudulent I-129 petitions and obtain H-1B visas for workers that the defendants could later place at local companies.\nBy maintaining a group of available workers, the defendants would gain a competitive advantage over consultants that properly applied for paperwork only after matching a qualified worker to and available job.\nAccording to the indictment, several of the I-129 petitions submitted by defendants stated that particular workers had specific jobs waiting for them at designated companies when, in reality, the defendants knew that these jobs did not exist.\nFurther, the defendants allegedly sought the cooperation of third parties to conceal their fraud.\nFor example, defendants allegedly orchestrated payments by Nanosemantics to at least one individual for permission to list his company as the employer for foreign workers even though Nanosemantics actually intended to place the workers elsewhere.\nFurther, defendants allegedly coached foreign workers and others, to respond to government inquiries in a way that would prevent the government from discovering the fraud.\nThe defendants were charged with one count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud and ten counts of substantive visa fraud.\nThe defendants were arrested last week in their respective towns of residence.\nAll three defendants entered pleas of not guilty and were released on bonds.\nThey are next scheduled to appear on May 13, 2019, for a status conference before Judge Edward J Davila, US District Judge.\nIf convicted, the defendants face a maximum sentence of ten years, and a fine of USD 250,000, plus restitution if appropriate for each violation.

Credit: Daniel Munoz\nBusinesses that apply for the global talent scheme program can then lodge applications for candidates to be granted four-year visas for sought-after talent who would otherwise only be able to stay in Australia for two years.\nLast month, the effectiveness of the program was questioned after a freedom of information request revealed no visas had been issued in the first six months of the visa's one-year pilot.\nAdvertisement StartupAus chief executive Alex McCauley said visa policies take time to \"filter into consciousness\" of the startup community.\n\"It's a critical need area for startups, but it's also hard to convince founders to take the time to solve five-year problems when they're usually focused on five-week problems,\" he said.\nBusinesses that sign up to the scheme before June 30 can enter labour agreements that will last for five years even if the scheme gets axed after the pilot, StartupAus said.\nThe visa is on offer until at least the end of its pilot on July 1. The Labor opposition has its own policy, the SMART visa, a four-year option for those in the science, medicine, academia, research and tech sectors.\nShadow minister for the digital economy, Ed Husic, said besides this policy, Labor would soon \"be announcing reforms to improve the sector's access to digital talent\".\nGeneral manager at Fintech Australia Rebecca Schot-Guppy says regardless of the visa policy on offer, many fintech businesses can't find or recruit the talent they need and complexity is rife.\n\"Examples overseas have shown that it's not enough for government to just introduce a policy. For it to be successful it needs to be promoted and encouraged by government. This includes listening to the community and ensuring the processes involved in applying are straightforward and aren't too time-consuming,\" she said.\nFinTech Australia general manager Rebecca Schot-Guppy.\nMs Schot-Guppy said it was time policymakers started putting themselves in a \"founder mindset\" when designing these policies, including considering the time required for applications.\nOthers believe Australian startups should be looking closer to home to fill tech recruitment roles.\n\"I used to agree that Australia had a lack of tech talent and that the only solution was to source more IT workers from overseas. Then, after starting a business helping connect tech talent with companies, I found this to be far from the truth,\" co-founder of IT solutions firm TechDirect Paula Barry said.\nThe issue is more that upskilling doesn't happen when it is needed, she believes, meaning training policies should be front and centre for policymakers.\n\"The skills that many of our tech workers held as little as five years ago are now no longer relevant.\"\nThe government has been contacted for comment.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_1.37%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_672%2C$y_49/t_crop_custom/w_1456/q_62%2Cf_auto/457ac014af331fd9789bd0fb8cdd3c979a9dfa44", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_1.51%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_672%2C$y_49/t_crop_custom/w_1600/q_62%2Cf_auto/457ac014af331fd9789bd0fb8cdd3c979a9dfa44", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.249%2C$multiply_1.37%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/w_1456/q_62%2Cf_auto/57c15e50c72b3749ceb20e7d8d56b8f285189440", "https://twitter.com/mysmallbusiness", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.249%2C$multiply_1%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/w_750/q_62%2Cf_auto/57c15e50c72b3749ceb20e7d8d56b8f285189440", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.249%2C$multiply_1%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/w_375/q_86%2Cf_auto/57c15e50c72b3749ceb20e7d8d56b8f285189440", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_1%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_672%2C$y_49/t_crop_custom/w_375/q_86%2Cf_auto/457ac014af331fd9789bd0fb8cdd3c979a9dfa44", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.249%2C$multiply_1%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/w_800/q_86%2Cf_auto/57c15e50c72b3749ceb20e7d8d56b8f285189440,", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_1%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_672%2C$y_49/t_crop_custom/w_800/q_86%2Cf_auto/457ac014af331fd9789bd0fb8cdd3c979a9dfa44,", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_1%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_672%2C$y_49/t_crop_custom/w_750/q_62%2Cf_auto/457ac014af331fd9789bd0fb8cdd3c979a9dfa44", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.249%2C$multiply_1.51%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/w_1600/q_62%2Cf_auto/57c15e50c72b3749ceb20e7d8d56b8f285189440", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.249%2C$multiply_1%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/w_728/q_86%2Cf_auto/57c15e50c72b3749ceb20e7d8d56b8f285189440,", "https://www.facebook.com/mysmallbusinessau/", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysmallbusiness", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.249%2C$multiply_1%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/w_375/q_86%2Cf_auto/57c15e50c72b3749ceb20e7d8d56b8f285189440,", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_1%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_672%2C$y_49/t_crop_custom/w_375/q_86%2Cf_auto/457ac014af331fd9789bd0fb8cdd3c979a9dfa44,", "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_1%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_672%2C$y_49/t_crop_custom/w_728/q_86%2Cf_auto/457ac014af331fd9789bd0fb8cdd3c979a9dfa44,"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "emma koehn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alex mccauley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "startupaus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel munoz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T12:27:27.081+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d1f54077bcfbe50b60e361a41edf5f4c06fe0832", "url": "https://article.wn.com/view/2019/04/02/3_Indians_charged_in_US_with_visa_fraud_again/", "site_full": "article.wn.com", "site": "wn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.wn.com/English/keyword/america", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WN.com -

And that's where our plan comes in.\"\nThe plan, which limits data to 5G or 4G LTE service, also includes the company's suite of parental controls, called Verizon Smart Family Premium . Verizon usually charges $9.99 per month for the app that lets parents manage screen time and set limits on what kids can see via content filters, and that includes location tracking so parents can keep tabs on their kids' whereabouts.\nThe 5GB of data included in the plan is another way parents can limit how much their kids use the phones. And they don't have to worry about overage fees. Safety Mode, which slows down service when it reaches the 5GB limit, ensures that parents' aren't socked with any surprise fees at the end of the month.\nVerizon The Just Kids plan is part of Verizon's mix-and-match data plans, which allow you to select different tiers within the same family plan. In order to get the plan, you need at least one device on an unlimited plan.\nPrices for Just Kids range between $35 and $55, depending on the number of unlimited lines signed up to the account. The service will be available starting April 4.\nNow playing: Watch this: Don't hold your breath for Verizon 5G Home service 1:45 Apple News Plus service for news junkies : Get all the articles you want from select publishers.\nEverything we know about the Pixel 4 and 4 XL : Keep tabs on the rumors about Google's upcoming marquee phones.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "angie klein", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "verizon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnet verizon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "verizon smart family premium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pdt sopa images verizon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T13:31:49.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "99d7fc9bc9cf01182e07540cf49d88d6f72f9515", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/three-indian-origin-consultants-charged-in-us-with-h-1b-visa-fraud/articleshow/68688242.cms", "site_full": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/rssfeedsdefault.cms", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "The Times of India", "title": "H1B visa: Three Indian-origin consultants charged in US with H-1B visa fraud", "title_full": "H1B visa: Three Indian-origin consultants charged in US with H-1B visa fraud -

Suffolk County businesses have experienced uncertainty year after year and they need stability and consistency.\" By Lisa Finn, Patch Staff | Apr 1, 2019 9:09 pm ET 0 (Courtesy Lee Zeldin.) EAST HAMPTON, NY \u2014 After an outcry from East End business owners worried that they wouldn't have enough workers to meet the seasonal demand, Rep. Lee Zeldin applauded Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, who decided to allocate an additional 30,000 H-2B visas for the remainder of 2019.\n\"However, the fight isn't over,\" Zeldin said. \"Suffolk County businesses have experienced uncertainty year after year and they need stability and consistency for the seasons ahead. I look forward to continuing to advocate on behalf of these hardworking Long Islanders so they can continue to grow their businesses in our community and strengthen our local economy.\"\nLast week, Zeldin met with local business owners in Westhampton to call upon the Department of Homeland Security to raise the H-2B visa cap, and to work toward a permanent, long-term solution to improve the H-2A and H-2B Visa programs.\nSeasonal visa programs allow employers to supplement their current workforce by hiring foreign workers on a seasonal basis; these foreign workers come to the United States legally filling jobs not already filled by U.S. employees in areas of labor shortage, Zeldin said.\nThe outcry came after U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services had already notified employers the 66,000 visa cap had been reached for the second half of the year for H-2B, despite the fact that many businesses locally and throughout the country had not received the workforce they needed for the furiously busy summer season \u2014 even though the local workforce just is not available in many communities, Zeldin said.\nHe added that he believes it is clear the current H-2B visa cap cannot adequately meet the demands of today's seasonal businesses, and DHS should lift the cap to provide certainty and stability.\n\"If you employed every single able-bodied person in Suffolk County it would still not be enough to fill all of the open positions these business owners have,\" Zeldin said. \"It is a great problem to have, when our local economy has more available jobs than people available to fill the positions, but it is imperative our employers are able to somehow fill their work force legally and immediately. Peak season is upon us and the Secretary of Homeland Security must utilize her authority to raise the cap to ensure Suffolk County businesses have the workforce they need for this peak season as well as stability and consistency in the years ahead.\"\n\"This program is the lifeblood of our resort town and many others just like it throughout America.\"\nOthers agreed.\n\"It's no secret that our sleepy little hamlet of Montauk has become a well-known and extremely popular vacation destination,\" said President of the Montauk Chamber of Commerce Paul Monte. \"Each year, thanks to our residents and loyal visitors, hundreds of millions of dollars in spending are generated just by the accommodations, food and beverage and retail industries in our little hamlet. Over the past 10 years it has become increasingly difficult to find homegrown labor to fill our seasonal positions, and now, with our booming economy and record low unemployment it is almost impossible.

They pleaded not guilty and have been granted bail by the court. Their next date of trial is May 13. Kishore Dattapuram, Kumar Aswapathi and Santosh Giri hail from the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and set up a consulting firm in Santa Clara in the US. The allegation against them is they set up Nanosemantics Inc and between May 2012 and 2015 submitted fraudulent H-1B visa applications. The Department of Justice in an indictment said this was \u2018in order to gain a competitive advantage over competing firms\u2019. The three of them were arrested on March 27. While Kishore Dattapuram, 49, was produced in the federal court in San Jose, Kumar Aswapathi, 49, was produced in the federal court in Austin. Santosh Giri, 32, was produced in the court in San Jose on March 28. \u201cAn indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt,\u201d the Department of Justice said. However, if convicted, the defendants face a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a fine of 2.5 lakh dollars plus restitution if appropriate for each violation of 18 USC 1546 (a) (visa fraud). They can also face a maximum sentence of five years in prison and fine of 2.5 lakh dollars, plus restitution if appropriate for the conspiracy count. The Department of Justice, US Attorney\u2019s Office, Northern District of California said a federal grand jury had indicted the three defendants in the visa fraud scheme. US attorney Adavid L Anderson and Department of Homeland Security, Home Security Investigations special agent in charge Ryal L Spardlin said there were indicted on 11 counts. The defendants company allegedly submitted fraudulent applications for high-tech worker visas. Their Santa Clara-based consulting firm provided services including placing skilled foreign workers at software and technology companies in the Bay Area. According to the indictment, the defendants worked together to submit the fraudulent H-1B visa applications so that foreign workers could obtain temporary authorities to live and work for employer in the United States. The Department of Justice explained that in order to secure an H-1B visa, an employer or other sponsor must submit an \u201cI-129\u201d petition to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. A petition and association documentation must confirm the existence and duration of the job waiting for the worker, and describe key details including wages. However, the defendants allegedly used Nanosemantics to submit I-129 petitions and obtain H-1B visas for workers that the defendants could later place at local companies. \u201cBy maintaining a group of available workers, the defendants could gain a competitive advantage over consultants that properly applied for paperwork only after matching a qualified worker to the available job,\u201d the Department of Justice said. According to the indictment, several of the I-129 petitions submitted by defendants started that particular workers had specific jobs waiting for them at designated companies when, in reality, the defendants knew that these jobs did not exist. \u201cFurther, the defendants allegedly sought the cooperation of third parties to conceal their fraud,\u201d the indictment said. The defendants allegedly orchestrated payments by Nanosemantics to at least one individual for permission to list his company as the employer for foreign workers even though Nanosemantics actually intended to place the workers else. \u201cFurther, defendants coached foreign workers and others, to respond to government inquiries in a way that would prevent the government from discovering the fraud,\u201d the Department of Justice said", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kishore dattapuram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kumar aswapathi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santosh giri", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nanosemantics inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa clara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "telangana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andhra pradesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san jose", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T01:00:30.056+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "640f161060d26b232fd856bfc9b3fb7638d33355", "url": "https://patch.com/new-york/easthampton/zeldin-lauds-allocation-30k-more-visas-meet-seasonal-need", "site_full": "patch.com", "site": "patch.com", "site_section": "https://patch.com/new-york/easthampton", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "East Hampton, NY Patch - Breaking Local News Events Schools Weather &amp; Sports", "title": "Zeldin Lauds Allocation Of 30K More Visas To Meet Seasonal Need | East Hampton, NY", "title_full": "Zeldin Lauds Allocation Of 30K More Visas To Meet Seasonal Need | East Hampton, NY Patch", "published": "2019-04-02T05:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.013, "main_image": "https://cdn20.patchcdn.com/users/1296254/20190401/090939/styles/T800x600/public/processed_images/zeldinvisas-1554167215-7355.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 465, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 14, "comments": 2, "shares": 7}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "640f161060d26b232fd856bfc9b3fb7638d33355", "url": "https://patch.com/new-york/easthampton/zeldin-lauds-allocation-30k-more-visas-meet-seasonal-need", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lisa Finn", "published": "2019-04-02T05:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Zeldin Lauds Allocation Of 30K More Visas To Meet Seasonal Need | East Hampton, NY", "text": "politics & government Zeldin Lauds Allocation Of 30K More Visas To Meet Seasonal Need \"The fight isn't over. Suffolk County businesses have experienced uncertainty year after year and they need stability and consistency.\" By Lisa Finn, Patch Staff | Apr 1, 2019 9:09 pm ET 0 (Courtesy Lee Zeldin.) EAST HAMPTON, NY \u2014 After an outcry from East End business owners worried that they wouldn't have enough workers to meet the seasonal demand, Rep. Lee Zeldin applauded Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, who decided to allocate an additional 30,000 H-2B visas for the remainder of 2019.\n\"However, the fight isn't over,\" Zeldin said. \"Suffolk County businesses have experienced uncertainty year after year and they need stability and consistency for the seasons ahead. I look forward to continuing to advocate on behalf of these hardworking Long Islanders so they can continue to grow their businesses in our community and strengthen our local economy.\"\nLast week, Zeldin met with local business owners in Westhampton to call upon the Department of Homeland Security to raise the H-2B visa cap, and to work toward a permanent, long-term solution to improve the H-2A and H-2B Visa programs.\nSeasonal visa programs allow employers to supplement their current workforce by hiring foreign workers on a seasonal basis; these foreign workers come to the United States legally filling jobs not already filled by U.S. employees in areas of labor shortage, Zeldin said.\nThe outcry came after U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services had already notified employers the 66,000 visa cap had been reached for the second half of the year for H-2B, despite the fact that many businesses locally and throughout the country had not received the workforce they needed for the furiously busy summer season \u2014 even though the local workforce just is not available in many communities, Zeldin said.\nHe added that he believes it is clear the current H-2B visa cap cannot adequately meet the demands of today's seasonal businesses, and DHS should lift the cap to provide certainty and stability.\n\"If you employed every single able-bodied person in Suffolk County it would still not be enough to fill all of the open positions these business owners have,\" Zeldin said. \"It is a great problem to have, when our local economy has more available jobs than people available to fill the positions, but it is imperative our employers are able to somehow fill their work force legally and immediately. Peak season is upon us and the Secretary of Homeland Security must utilize her authority to raise the cap to ensure Suffolk County businesses have the workforce they need for this peak season as well as stability and consistency in the years ahead.\"\n\"This program is the lifeblood of our resort town and many others just like it throughout America.\"\nOthers agreed.\n\"It's no secret that our sleepy little hamlet of Montauk has become a well-known and extremely popular vacation destination,\" said President of the Montauk Chamber of Commerce Paul Monte. \"Each year, thanks to our residents and loyal visitors, hundreds of millions of dollars in spending are generated just by the accommodations, food and beverage and retail industries in our little hamlet. Over the past 10 years it has become increasingly difficult to find homegrown labor to fill our seasonal positions, and now, with our booming economy and record low unemployment it is almost impossible. The solution to this ongoing problem has been the H-2B visa, guest worker program. This program is the lifeblood of our resort town and many others just like it throughout America. Without the seasonal workers provided by this program many businesses would be forced to scale back on their services or in some cases actually close their doors for good.\"\nThe agricultural community has the potential to be hit especially hard, many agreed.\n\"The workforce provided by the H-2A visa program is vital to enabling the farmers in Suffolk County to continue to feed our local communities,\" said Rob Carpenter, director of the Long Island Farm Bureau after the event. \"At every level \u2014 from the farms to the halls of Congress \u2014 it is critical that everyone understands what an important role this program, and the workforce it provides, plays in our communities and for our small businesses that are the backbone of our towns.\"\nWith the busiest season fast approaching, local business owners were worried that their hands would be tied and businesses crippled, explained landscape specialist Gordon Andrews of Hampton Bays before the event.\n\"Year after year, we experience the same uncertainty, which hurts the potential growth of our business and our local economy.

They are next scheduled to appear on May 13 for a status conference before Judge Edward J Davila, US District Judge.\nIf convicted, the defendants face a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution if appropriate for each violation.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kishore dattapuram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kumar aswapathi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aswapathi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nanoseman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santosh giri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dattapuram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giri", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "united states citizenship and immigration services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa clara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san jose", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T02:50:22.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6893d5629d3a184cadacaa7cb5deda53cefc78a2", "url": "https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/368657/visa-v-gains-but-lags-market-what-you-should-know", "site_full": "www.zacks.com", "site": "zacks.com", "site_section": "http://feed.zacks.com/commentary/AllStories/rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance", "mutual_funds"], "section_title": "Zacks Investment Research - All Commentary Articles", "title": "Visa (V) Gains But Lags Market: What You Should Know", "title_full": "Visa (V) Gains But Lags Market: What You Should Know", "published": "2019-04-02T00:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/default_article_images/default225.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8414, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6893d5629d3a184cadacaa7cb5deda53cefc78a2", "url": "https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/368657/visa-v-gains-but-lags-market-what-you-should-know", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Zacks Equity Research", "published": "2019-04-02T00:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Visa (V) Gains But Lags Market: What You Should Know", "text": "You follow Tale of the Tape - edit You follow Zacks Equity Research - edit What would you like to follow?

On that day, VZ is projected to report earnings of $1.17 per share, which would represent no growth from the year-ago period.

If you are over 44 but less than 50 years old, you can still apply for the Australian PR visa. But you will not get any PR point under the Australian immigration point calculation system.
