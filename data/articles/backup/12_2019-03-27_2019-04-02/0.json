In actuality, the series is wrapping up with Dark Phoenix , the Simon Kinberg-directed installment that will debut in theaters in June, because the minds behind the franchise always saw it as a \"kind of natural culmination\" of the X-Men stories.\n\"We felt like we were completing certain emotional arguments. We were completing certain emotional ideas. And in trying to take the story further, it dictated we make certain choices from which we couldn't come back. You know, [like] Raven's death. Certain choices,\" said Parker. \"One of the challenges of doing the sequel to a franchise is how do you keep it fresh? How do you keep pushing forward? And I think too often we treat the ground is we play it safe and we don't make movies that are as interesting as they should be. So we tried to free ourselves from that hesitation this time and kind of let it fly. And so in its own way, that became a kind of natural culmination.\"\nAs past trailers for Dark Phoenix so boldly revealed, Sophie Turner's Jean Grey kills Jennifer Lawrence's Raven, better known as Mystique, while she's in her deadly and dangerous Dark Phoenix form. Many X-Men fans will remember witnessing Jean become the Dark Phoenix in an earlier franchise entry \u2013 X-Men: The Last Stand , which saw Jean (then played by Famke Janssen) assuming her vicious alter-ego after a flood and turning against her X-family. Parker explained how Dark Phoenix differentiates itself from The Last Stand .\n\"This is pretty different than the third movie. I mean the decision here, it was really Simon [Kinberg]'s decision was to tell the Dark Phoenix story but really tell it as Jean's story. So that was first and foremost. So it's a much more thorough investigation of that saga of the story at that heart of the saga and much truer to Jean as a character. I think you're right that one of the challenges was how do we balance what is in the comics in the galactic and intergalactic nature of that storyline with wanting to stay more Earth centric. And you know, we obviously made the decision to include some of that, but to keep it rooted in and around the characters we've come to know and love within the X-Men .\"\nEven Kinberg agrees that Dark Phoenix is an organic stopping point for the series, which will expand into fresh territory under the watchful eyes at Marvel Studios \u2014 namely president Kevin Feige, who is poised to take over the franchise and make some big changes of his own. The creative stated during CCXP back in December of 2018, three months before Disney's $71.3 billion acquisition of the majority of Fox's assets, that Dark Phoenix is the end of the era of Fox-produced X-Men movies and will allow for Marvel to create a whole new chapter moving forward.\n\"I see it as taking the franchise in a different direction tonally. And that doesn't mean that the next one will have the same tone, it just means that the next one can have a different tone,\" Kinberg said of Dark Phoenix (via ComicBook.com ). \"I think for many years, the X-Men, Bryan [Singer] really transformed the superhero genre in 2000 or 2001 when the first one came out. That's almost 20 years ago. It is a long time ago. And at that time, superhero movies were not wildly popular, actually. There had been a few failures in the mid-90s, and there hadn't been a lot of superhero movies, if any, around that time and X-Men sort of was revolutionary in its moment.\"\nAs mentioned before, Marvel Studios head honcho Feige is set to shake up the X-Men franchise now that he's taken the keys under the terms of the Disney-Fox merger. Prior to the deal going through, it was confirmed that all of Fox's X-Men movies would be placed on hold until all parties signed on the dotted line, which they did on March 20 . These include Gambit , X-Force , and the rumored Kitty Pryde solo film \u2014 all of which should, theoretically, be on Marvel's radar now that Disney and Fox are now one entity. We haven't heard official word on what Feige and Marvel brass plan to do with the trio of projects, but what we have heard is that Feige wants to carve out a place for a new Wolverine in the Marvel Cinematic Universe \u2014 someone younger than original actor Hugh Jackman.\nFor now, though, Feige and co. are still mapping out plans for the MCU post-merger. Feige previously mentioned that it would be quite a while before the deal directly impacted Marvel's movie universe, and (now ex) X-Men franchise producer Lauren Shuler Donner once said that Feige is \"still dealing with the wealth of characters and trying to make sense of it all.\" Disney and Marvel did take ownership over a ton of incredible characters formerly housed at Fox, but what the companies actually end up doing with them is anyone's guess at this point.\nAll things considered, fans of the X-Men franchise shouldn't start waving their pitchforks at the House of Mouse for ending the movie series by acquiring Fox, as that just isn't the truth. Instead, they can take a deep breath, calm their minds, count down the days until Dark Phoenix opens on June 7, and look forward to seeing what Marvel's vision of the X-Men will turn out to be.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://comicbook.com/2019/03/31/dark-phoenix-producer-explains-how-film-different-x-men-last-stand/", "https://www.grunge.com/39740/untold-truth-marvel-cinematic-universe/", "https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/03/31/dark-phoenix-producer-says-disney-purchase-not-reason-series-ending/", "https://comicbook.com/2019/03/31/dark-phoenix-director-addresses-missteps-previous-x-men-movies/", "https://www.slashfilm.com/x-men-in-the-mcu/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hutch parker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "disney-fox", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "walt disney company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wondercon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "anaheim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T00:02:58.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a9a28371a1ff54f5f00fb3367d7558a4a7dab6c0", "url": "https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stephen-smith-and-centerbridge-partners-l-p-complete-acquisition-of-walmart-canada-bank-1028076176", "site_full": "markets.businessinsider.com", "site": "businessinsider.com", "site_section": "https://markets.businessinsider.com/news", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance", "options"], "section_title": "Stock Market News | Financial &amp; Business News | Markets Insider", "title": "Stephen Smith and Centerbridge Partners, L.P.

The Pure Spa 4-person inflatable hot tub, $380, is here just in time for (hopefully) warmer weather-and you can bet we'll be purchasing one ASAP before they sell out. The hot tub is suitable for indoor or outdoor use and features a 210-gallon pool with 120 air jets and a 2200W heater. A HEATER, yes, that's right. Four people can fit comfortably inside at one time, and it even comes with an insulating lid to keep the water warm if you decide to hop out for a BBQ burger or two. Sure, summer might feel like nothing but a far away dream right now, but imagine having all your pals over for some quality time and some bubbles (literally) in this perfect product. BLISS.

Disney Last year\u2019s The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is mostly cinematic cotton candy, but it\u2019s been stuck in my craw ever since I saw it. Despite not being a remake of, or a sequel to, any Disney movie I\u2019d seen before, it gave me a powerful sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Recently, it dawned on me why: The Nutcracker and 2017\u2019s live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast each denote a progressive and feminist sensibility by outfitting their heroine in pants, and giving her exactly one personality trait: a fondness for science. I have no problem with Disney pivoting all of its live-action heroines to being science nerds. But the devil is in the details: Along the characters\u2019 actual journeys, there\u2019s no subtlety to the way these traits are integrated, or any use when it comes to their place in the story. In both movies, the leads demonstrate their love for science in facile ways, bluntly stating their interest or tinkering (to debatable effect) with some curio that would fit more comfortably on the floor of a steampunk convention. The use for their scientific pursuit is limited to scenarios engineered for them, rather than being a meaningful contribution. For instance, Belle comes up with a washing machine prototype at the beginning of Beauty and the Beast that never crops up again. Otherwise, the scientific method is largely forgotten. Belle (Emma Watson) and her father (Kevin Kline) in Beauty and the Beast . Disney Tim Burton\u2019s new take on Dumbo cements this penchant for STEM topics as a trend, as that single trait once again defines its lead, Milly Farrier (Nico Parker). Repeatedly, she tells people about her love of science. She owns a chemistry set (that she never uses) and does a little animal training \u2014 the latter of which she constantly refers to as employing \u201cthe scientific method\u201d or \u201cthe rules of science,\u201d despite it bearing no discernible connection to the field. There\u2019s no question that these characteristics are well-intentioned, but there\u2019s a chasm between good intentions and affecting results. Science amounts to little more than a costume for Clara, Belle, and Milly. Their single interest doesn\u2019t inform their growth. Instead, all three movies default to the same broad thematic arc about not doubting oneself. And yet, the lead\u2019s interest in science is made to be such a big deal early in each story that the degree to which they ultimately don\u2019t factor into the conclusion is jarring. At its worst, science feels almost like a last-minute character addition. The script for Dumbo tells us that Milly loves science, but has to twist itself into pretzels to hide the fact that her ultimate purpose isn\u2019t to be unique, but to facilitate Dumbo\u2019s flight \u2014 which doesn\u2019t require scientific inquiry at all. If anything, the film could have made Dumbo\u2019s gift and Milly\u2019s scientific mind a source of friction. No such luck. I reserve some hope for future female leads with a knack for science. The Disney movies that don\u2019t fall short in this respect are those in which that love is naturally integrated and engaged with, rather than used as a prop \u2014 but also, granted, they\u2019re adapted from non-Disney source material. A Wrinkle in Time and Black Panther both feature young women with an interest in science and technology: Meg Murry (Storm Reid) and Shuri (Letitia Wright). Their passions make a dramatic impact on the problems they face. T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman) and Shuri (Letitia Wright) in her lab. Marvel Studios/Walt Disney Studios Meg\u2019s parents are scientists, and she quite literally has to follow in her father\u2019s footsteps in order to find him. Shuri\u2019s interest in and talent for tech is just as much personal as it is part and parcel with her responsibilities as a princess. In Black Panther \u2019s big car chase sequence, she\u2019s operating the vehicle remotely, working in real time to keep the tech (and the car) from crashing. By contrast, Disney uses book smarts and curiosity as a substitute for female independence in the same way that proficiency in martial arts or a leather jacket once signaled that female characters were \u201ctough\u201d and \u201ccool.\u201d They\u2019re visual signifiers or traits not traditionally considered \u201cgirly,\u201d but they\u2019re also only surface-level indicators. Milly cites Marie Curie as a role model multiple times, but there\u2019s no explanation of who she was or why she\u2019s so significant to Milly as a scientific hero, beyond a diorama in which Curie is the only woman in a room full of men. The movie is taking advantage of the way the field of science was historically considered unsuitable for women as shorthand for how its young heroine is going against the grain, but places no emphasis on the actual work women did. Changing a character in thoughtful and rewarding ways isn\u2019t impossible, but it can\u2019t be done for the sake of lip service. Cinderella and Maleficent , for instance, both revisited and revitalized well-known characters by fleshing out the extant material (and an entire backstory, in the latter case) instead of \u201cupdating\u201d these characters in a way that, ironically, comes across as directly contradictory to the \u201cyou are enough\u201d message that these films are meant to send. Broadly speaking, the big thing these young women learn is that they\u2019re more than good enough just as they are. Their shiny new interests suggest that someone thought otherwise, but ultimately just prove the point: To paraphrase Annie Lennox and Aretha Franklin, sisters have to do it for themselves, not to keep up appearances with others.

Now, the retailer is taking over the swimsuit arena, with its in-house Time and Tru collection of mix and match separates.\nAccording to Walmart reps (and the endless amounts of praise on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram), shoppers can't get enough of the best-selling bikinis by Time and Tru , which are made to fit sizes small all the way up to a 3x. And get this: the affordable designs are less than $18, so you'll have plenty of money leftover to sip pi\u00f1a coladas by the pool.\nWhat's even better are the functional details in the Time and Tru lineup, which include underwire finishes and adjustable straps to ensure the perfect fit, as endorsed by influencer Noelle Downing , who posted a sponsored post in the underwire bikini top ($16; walmart.com ) and lace-up bottoms ($16; walmart.com ) above. They're so good, in fact, that people are passing on Victoria's Secret push-up styles for Walmart's selects. One of InStyle 's Facebook followers tipped us off in the comment section underneath a VS post, admitting to finding awesome plus-size options at Wally World, for a fraction of the price.\nAnd Walmart's also giving Target's beloved swimsuits a run for their money. On Twitter Emmie wrote, \"I tried a lot on at Target and wasn\u2019t feeling it. Online Walmart!!! That\u2019s where I found two Time and Tru plus size swimsuits!\"\nPeak season to grab the Time and Tru swimsuits is in May. But if you wait to late your favorite style or size might be sold out.

Collapse\nJust like we witnessed during the last recession, major retailers are laying off tens of thousands of workers, and it looks like this will be the worst year for store closings in all of U.S. history. Many are referring to this as \u201cthe retail apocalypse\u201d , and without a doubt this is one of the toughest stretches for retailers that we have ever seen. But many believe that what we have witnessed so far is just the beginning . After all, if retailers are struggling this much now, how bad will things be once the next recession really gets rolling?\nOf course the truth is that things have been rocky for the retail industry for quite a few years, but the numbers are telling us that this crisis is really starting to accelerate.\n***Support BeforeItsNews by trying APeX (far superior to colloidal silver) or any of our other great health products at www.mitocopper.com *** According to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, retail layoffs were up a whopping 92 percent in January and February compared to the same period a year ago. The following comes from NBC News \u2026\nMore than 41,000 people have lost their jobs in the retail industry so far this year \u2014 a 92 percent spike in layoffs since the same time last year, according to a new report.\nAnd the layoffs continue to mount, with JCPenney announcing this week it would be closing 18 stores in addition to three previously announced closures, as part of a \u201cstandard annual review.\u201d\nYes, competition from Internet commerce is hurting the traditional retail industry, but it certainly doesn\u2019t explain a 92 percent increase.\nAnd very few retailers have been able to avoid this downsizing trend. At this point, even the largest retailer in the entire country has begun \u201cquietly closing stores\u201d \u2026\nWalmart is closing at least 11 US stores across eight states.\nThe stores include one Walmart Supercenter in Lafayette, Louisiana, and Walmart Neighborhood Market stores in Arizona, California, Kansas, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Washington.\nFor decades, Wal-Mart has been expanding extremely aggressively.\nThey have plenty of cash, and so the only way that it would make sense for them to close stores is if they anticipated that we are heading into a recession.\nHere is a list of the addresses where Wal-Mart stores are closing \u2026\n6085 W. Chandler Blvd., Chandler, Arizona\n3900 W. Ina Road, Tucson, Arizona\n1600 Saratoga Ave., San Jose, California\n712 N. Western Ave., Liberal, Kansas\n1229 NE. Evangeline Trwy., Lafayette, Louisiana\n3603 Broad River Road, Columbia, South Carolina\n1757 W. Andrew Johnson Hwy., Morristown, Tennessee\n2501 University Commons Way, Knoxville, Tennessee\n7000 Iron Bridge Road, North Chesterfield, Virginia\n2864 Virginia Beach Blvd., Virginia Beach, Virginia\n7809 NE. Vancouver Plaza Dr., Vancouver, Washington\nOf course Wal-Mart is in far better shape than almost everyone else in the industry.\nOne of Wal-Mart\u2019s key competitors, Shopko, has just announced that they will be shutting down all of their stores \u2026\nShopko will liquidate its assets and close all of its remaining locations by mid-June.\nThe company was unable to find a buyer for the retail business and will begin winding down its operations beginning this week, the company said in statement released Monday. The decision to liquidate will bring an end to the brick-and-mortar business that began in 1962 with one location in Green Bay, Wisconsin.\nAnd personally I was very saddened to learn that Lifeway Christian Bookstores has also decided to close all their brick and mortar stores \u2026\nLifeway Christian Bookstores announced last week it would be closing the doors of all 170 brick and mortar stores, in a pivot to focusing on digital and e-commerce.\n\u201cThe decision to close our local stores is a difficult one,\u201d said Lifeway Chief Executive Officer Brad Waggoner. \u201cWhile we had hoped to keep some stores open, current market projections show this is no longer a viable option.\u201d\nWhenever I do an article like this, I always have some readers that try to convince me that this is only happening because of the growth of Internet retailing.\nAnd yes, Internet retailing has been growing, but it still accounts for less than 10 percent of all U.S. retail sales. In addition, it is important to point out that Internet retailers had a very disappointing holiday season just like brick and mortar retailers did.\nUltimately, the truth is that the U.S. economy has been steadily slowing down in recent months.\nDuring the months of December, January and February, the amount of stuff being moved around the country by truck, rail and air was lower than during all of those same months a year earlier. The following comes from Wolf Richter \u2026\nNow it\u2019s the third month in a row, and the red flag is getting more visible and a little harder to ignore about the goods-based economy: Freight shipment volume in the US across all modes of transportation \u2013 truck, rail, air, and barge \u2013 in February fell 2.1% from February a year ago, according to the Cass Freight Index , released today. The three months in a row of year-over-year declines are the first such declines since the transportation recession of 2015 and 2016.\nI have a feeling that when we get the final numbers for March that they will show that this streak has now extended to four months.\nRight now, unsold goods are starting to pile up in U.S. warehouses at a rate that we haven\u2019t seen since the last recession. Many retailers that are barely clinging to life will simply not survive if economic conditions continue to deteriorate.\nUnfortunately, it appears that things are only going to get rougher for the U.S. economy in the months ahead.\nSo more retail workers are going to get laid off, more stores are going to close, and there are going to be a lot more stories about our ongoing \u201cretail apocalypse\u201d in the mainstream media.\nAbout the author: Michael Snyder is a nationally-syndicated writer, media personality and political activist.

A Disney heiress who has donated $70 million over the past 30 years says she would outlaw private jets if she could By Abigail Disney said she would outlaw private jets if she could. source Amanda Edwards/Getty Images\nPrivate jets allow rich people to \u201cget around a certain reality,\u201d the Disney heiress Abigail Disney told The Cut . Disney said that though her family had a 737 private jet, she decided to stop using it once she considered her carbon footprint and the cost her trips incurred. Private jets are popular purchases among many millionaires and billionaires looking for quick and easy travel.\nMark Cuban , Jeff Bezos , and other billionaires may own private jets, but the heiress Abigail Disney has a different set of thoughts on the topic.\n\u201cIf I were queen of the world, I would pass a law against private jets, because they enable you to get around a certain reality,\u201d Abigail Disney recently told The Cut . \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go through an airport terminal, you don\u2019t have to interact, you don\u2019t have to be patient, you don\u2019t have to be uncomfortable. These are the things that remind us we\u2019re human.\u201d\nDisney \u2013 who is the granddaughter of Roy Disney, a cofounder of The Walt Disney Co. \u2013 is an heiress to the Disney fortune. While she stayed mum on the exact size of her inheritance, she told The Cut that she could be a billionaire if she wanted to be and that she\u2019s donated more than $70 million since turning 21.\nHer dad\u2019s plane was a 737 with a queen-size bed and a shower, she said: \u201cWe would use the plane occasionally because I have four kids, so it was much easier, obviously, to ride on my dad\u2019s plane with them. Then, at a certain point, I just said, \u2018No, I think this is really bad for everybody.'\u201d\nThat defining moment, she told The Cut, came after thinking about her carbon footprint and the cost of her trip while riding on the jet alone for a quick trip from New York to California.\nRead more : An heiress to the Disney fortune has given away $70 million, and teaches her kids that money is the least important thing about them\nOwning a private jet is typically a hallmark among millionaires and billionaires, especially high-powered executives and investors working in the tech industry. For them, a private jet can allow for quick and easy travel if they need to be on the other coast on the same day, according to Business Insider\u2019s Paige Leskin .\nEven the notoriously frugal Warren Buffett has his own private jet. He once told CNBC it\u2019s \u201cthe only thing that I do that costs a lot of money.\u201d\nBut design trends in planes are evolving: Business Insider\u2019s Katie Warren previously reported that the super-wealthy no longer want their private jets to look like private jets. Instead, they want them to look like extensions of their homes or offices, and they are designing them in clean lines and cool color tones.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.businessinsider.my/", "https://www.thecut.com/2019/03/abigail-disney-has-more-money-than-shell-ever-spend.html", "https://www.businessinsider.my/category/finance/", "https://www.cnbc.com/id/49787452"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "heiress abigail disney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abigail disney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "disney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff bezos", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "disney", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T00:56:49.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ec9325c1e4cb43bb55d0d8cf18eed6b945dfbff9", "url": "https://in.pcmag.com/gallery/129576/disney-warnermedia-the-new-streaming-giants-explained", "site_full": "in.pcmag.com", "site": "pcmag.com", "site_section": "http://in.pcmag.com/feed.xml", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "PCMag India", "title": "Disney+?

The New Streaming Giants Explained Between Netflix, Amazon and Apple, and the media conglomerates such as Disney all launching their ow Rob Marvin April 1, 2019, 7:26 p.m.\nThe video-streaming industry is crowded with big names\u2014some with already-existing services and others with impending apps. Considering the current three largest platforms, the agglomeration of media companies, and the tech companies investing heavily in video, it can be hard to wrap your head around the sheer scope of the entertainment giants that make up this market.\nEach service has its own origin story, business interests, and exclusive originals and licensed content. There's also a wide assortment of fluctuating prices, packages and plans, and technology under the surface .\n\"We're seeing a ton of fragmentation,\" said streaming media consultant and expert Dan Rayburn . \"NBCUniversal is coming out with a service, Disney, WarnerMedia, Viacom bought PlutoTV, Amazon launched IMDb Freedive , and on and on. Netflix, Hulu, Facebook, YouTube, Amazon Prime, HBO...as consumers we're inundated with video everywhere we look.\"\nHere are the most important streaming services to watch in the next hyper-competitive phase of this industry, including interviews with execs from Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, CBS, and Disney, as well as industry analysts and experts. Netflix\nThe modern streaming industry begins and ends with what many have dubbed the \"Netflix Effect\": Regardless of how many Oscars, Emmys, or Golden Globe Awards the one-time DVD delivery service does or doesn't win , Netflix's digital subscription model and its massive investment in originals have set the bar for the market. Netflix reported 58 million US subscribers in September and 139 million subscribers worldwide in Q4.\nThe company generated $1.2 billion in annual net profit on $15.8 billion of revenue in 2018, giving it a current market valuation of around $154 billion, according to Bloomberg. Netflix keeps burning cash and raising debt financing to fund its original-content creation, but for now, the strategy is working. The service adds millions of subscribers around the globe each quarter.\nEven a recent price hike isn't expected to dent Netflix's subscriber base much. Jeffrey Cole, a Research Professor at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, and Director of USC's Center for the Digital Future , believes Netflix could be charging a lot more.\n\"It must drive [Netflix founder and CEO] Reed Hastings crazy that a dozen years ago in the red-envelope days, he gave you five DVDs at a time and unlimited streaming for $16 a month. Now he's giving you not just five theatrical films at a time but dozens or hundreds plus massive amounts of old television shows and $12 billion worth of originals for $9 or $13 or $16 a month,\" said Cole, who has researched the television, media, and streaming industries for almost three decades .\n\"If you paid $16 for five DVDs, you should pay $40 for what you're getting now. But when Netflix broke the company in half, each side priced down at $8. So Netflix is already handicapped by how much it can charge,\" added Cole. \"How much it can spend on originals depends on how fast it grows, and its growth is international. It will hit a wall...the only question is when.\"\nNetflix is ramping up other revenue streams, including a reported expansion of its ad business with more product placement in originals such as Queer Eye . And despite spending more than $1 billion a year on technology, CEO Reed Hastings still positions Netflix as more of a media company akin to Disney than a tech company like Apple or Amazon. Netflix is \"mostly a content company powered by tech,\" he told Recode in response to a question about industry regulation.\nThat posturing is largely semantic; in reality, modern streaming players are all media, entertainment, and tech companies rolled into one. Amazon Prime Video\nUnlike Netflix, Amazon has no discernible caps on how much it can spend, and its business model isn't dependent on video subscribers. Amazon confirmed in 2018 that it has more than 100 million Prime members, and Prime Video's US audience was around 26 million as of last year, Reuters reports .\nPrime Video's core value is to drive more Prime subscriptions at $119 a pop per year, which last year went up from $99 in the first price hike since 2014. So Amazon has no qualms about shelling out billions for original series and films on the indie festival circuit through Amazon Studios. Standalone Prime Video costs $8.99 per month.\nAmazon also owns Prime Video's underlying infrastructure. Streaming high-quality live and on-demand video requires a complicated content-delivery pipeline, from data hosting and storage to encoding and packaging files, all the way down to content delivery networks (CDNs) and playback. Amazon controls the pipes, and Prime Video can enjoy seemingly infinite scale thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nOther streaming platforms need Amazon's cloud, too. Netflix, for instance, spent years and untold millions building out its own global CDN network (the only streaming provider to do so) but relies entirely on AWS for cloud computing and storage.\n\"We package up and have built our technology infrastructure on top of AWS,\" said Girish Bajaj, VP of Software Engineering for Amazon Prime Video. \"Because we serve millions of customers and operate this massive amount of scale, it gives both Prime Video and AWS expertise in how to actually operate these systems, and with that level of scale comes cost savings that we then are able to offer back to customers on the consumer side as well as the enterprise side.\"\n(Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images) Apple\nAmazon has been competing with Netflix for years, but Apple's high-profile entry into the streaming landscape has the potential to further tip the balance of power toward the tech industry.\nLast week, Apple unveiled its Apple TV+ and Apple TV Channels services. TV Channels is coming in May with a major Apple TV software update, and TV+ will be available this fall in over 100 countries. The redesigned Apple TV app is also coming to more form factors, including Roku and Amazon Fire TV devices, and smart TVs from Samsung, Sony, LG, and Vizio.\nThe new Apple TV app will offer original content through the Apple TV+, as well as streaming app and network subscriptions through TV Channels, which is similar to the add-ons offered by Prime Video and Hulu. We don't know what Apple TV+ will cost yet, but Apple confirmed it will be an ad-free subscription service, seemingly disproving reports that Apple TV and iOS users would get access to Apple's original content for free. However, both TV+ and TV Channels will be available to other users in a household via Apple's Family Sharing.\nThrough TV Channels, Apple aims to bring an App Store-like gatekeeper approach to controlling streaming content on iOS devices, and will reportedly take a 30 percent cut on every streaming app subscription through its service. That's a steep commission, but in line with the 30 percent it currently takes on premium app and streaming-service subscriptions through the App Store . The commission drops to 15 percent for subscription renewals.\nTV Channels is launching in May with some big partners, including Amazon Prime Video, HBO, Hulu, Showtime, Starz, CBS All Access , and many others (but not Netflix); Apple showcased Prime Video originals such as The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel in demos during its launch event. TV Channels will also let users choose traditional cable bundles from providers such as Optimum and Spectrum, as well as over-the-top (OTT) cable replacement services including DirecTV Now and PlayStation Vue. Apple's Grand Designs\nThis strategy is part of Apple's broader push into software and services: It has grand designs to expand to several other industries beyond the steadily growing chunk of recurring revenue it currently makes from iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple Pay. Amid stagnating iPhone sales , Apple's glossy launch event for its new slate of services highlights how Apple sees its future growth.\nApple, like Amazon, owns its data centers, so every new service it releases holds tantalizing profit margins. Along with its new streaming offerings, Apple also unveiled its $9.99-per-month Apple News+ service for a bundled subscription to 300 magazines and newspapers, its Apple Arcade games subscription service, and the Goldman Sachs-backed Apple Card .\nFor all of these services\u2014particularly where it's aggregating content under its own banner\u2014Apple will take a hefty cut. The Wall Street Journal reported that the tech giant is demanding 50 percent from news publishers for Apple News+, which is built on Apple's acquisition of Texture , described as a \"Netflix for magazines.\"\nAs for original content, Apple's shows will reportedly be family-friendly ; no sex, violence, or profanity from Cupertino. When adding yet another online content platform to the digital media pile, banning R-rated content of any kind is certainly one way for Apple to differentiate its originals. That, and signing Oprah to make documentaries and bring back her book club as Apple exclusives.\n\u201cI think entertainment's going to become a key element of Apple's business,\u201d said USC's Jeffrey Cole. \u201cFor them, spending $2 billion on [original content] is just dabbling. If they like what they see, I think they'll have a $10 billion budget.\u201d Hulu\nThe third established veteran in the market, Hulu is a particularly intriguing player given its new mouse-shaped overlord. Hulu now has 25 million subscribers across its ad-supported, ad-free, and Hulu + Live TV services; it declined to break down that number into specific subscriber totals in an interview with PCMag.\nWith Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox, the entertainment powerhouse also picked up Fox's 30 percent stake in Hulu, giving it a majority 60 percent (it already owned 30 percent). Variety reports that Disney is in negotiations with AT&T to pick up an additional 10 percent stake, leaving Comcast/NBCUniversal's remaining 30 percent as the only outside ownership stake in a streaming platform that has long represented the network TV industry's collective streaming interests. Not anymore.\n\"Hulu really benefited, I think, by being owned by a handful of studios. Now it's basically a division of Disney,\" said USC's Cole.\nBut Cole doesn't believe Comcast will relinquish its Hulu stake for less than a kingly price. He cited Comcast's ultimately failed $65 million bid to steal 21st Century Fox away from Disney and the open secret of bad blood between Comcast CEO Brian Roberts and Disney chief Bob Iger.\nBeatrice Springborn, Vice President of Content Development at Hulu, said the service doesn't measure success by nightly ratings or individual show performance. It's about getting new subscribers to sign up for Hulu, watch a lot of content on the platform, and remain subscribers for the long haul.\nAs for how Disney's streaming plans will affect Hulu, Springborn said the company is staying the course until directed otherwise.\n\"It is impossible to predict the future, but we do know that Hulu is a major strategic asset for all of our owners. Hulu added 8 million subscribers last year, and that kind of growth is only possible when you have owners that support you and are aligned with your strategy,\" said Springborn. \"There is a lot of noise and speculation about transactions right now, but our teams are staying laser-focused on making Hulu the number-one choice for TV.\"\nFollowing Netflix's price increase, Hulu took the opposite route and cut the price of its entry-level ad-supported plan from $7.99 to $5.99 per month. But it did raise the price of its Hulu + Live TV plan package from $39.99 to $44.99 per month. WarnerMedia\nWarnerMedia is the most recent example of high-profile corporate consolidation fueling the next wave of streaming services. The newly formed pool of media brands and TV channels centralizes AT&T's Time Warner assets under one streaming roof .\nAT&T's major corporate restructuring of WarnerMedia was enacted shortly after the long-awaited regulatory approval of its merger with HBO and Turner parent company Time Warner. (HBO and Turner initially agreed to participate in this story but dropped out shortly before their scheduled interviews, in the wake of the sudden resignations of longtime HBO chief Richard Plepler and Turner head David Levy.)\nThe major changes approved by AT&T exec John Stankey (pictured above) include installing former NBC and Showtime head Bob Greenblatt as the new chairman of WarnerMedia Entertainment, the division handling WarnerMedia's TV assets and direct-to-consumer operations. He will oversee the group's crown jewel\u2014its forthcoming streaming platform combining all the content from HBO, TNT, TBS, TruTV, CNN, the CW, Warner Bros. and DC Comics films, Cartoon Network, and more under a single app.\nHBO will still be offered as a standalone service , but all of the premium cable network's original series, movies, documentaries, and so on will also be incorporated into the as-yet-unnamed WarnerMedia streaming service, which is targeted to launch in Q4 2019. We don't know pricing details, but Stankey said it'll be more expensive than HBO Now's current $14.99-per-month cost, which will put AT&T's service at the high end of the price continuum. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said on an earnings call that the new service will have a \"two-sided business model\" with both a premium tier offering commercial-free programming and a more affordable ad-supported tier akin to Hulu.\nAT&T's first foray into OTT streaming, DirecTV Now , hasn't enjoyed long-term success. It went with the cable-replication model of bundling channels together into various digital packages, similar to other Virtual Multichannel Programming Distributors (vMVPDs) such as Hulu + Live TV, Sling, PlayStation Vue, FuboTV, and YouTube TV. But as competition has increased, DirecTV Now subscribers have been fleeing in droves . The service lost 267,000 subscribers in Q4 of 2018 alone, and it has raised prices twice in the past year: a $5 increase last July and another $10 hike in March.\nThe telecommunications giant's move to buy Time Warner exemplifies a corporate-level shift across the industry away from that costly standalone model and into Subscription Video On-Demand (SVOD) with its WarnerMedia streaming service.\n\"We've been talking about cord-cutting for years and the death of cable for a decade, but how many subscribers do these services have?\" said Dan Rayburn. \"Sling is small. YouTube TV and PS Vue are less than a million each. DirecTV Now is down. That's the reality of this business. None of those services can survive on their own because of the cost of standalone.\"\n(Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images) NBCUniversal\nComcast-owned NBCUniversal's streaming service is set to launch in early 2020. There's still much we don't know, but the ad-supported service will reportedly be free for Comcast and Sky cable subscribers, as current on-demand episodes are on network websites with a cable login. NBCUniversal also hopes to ink deals to offer the service free to subscribers of other cable providers such as Charter, DirecTV, and Dish.\nThe company will also offer a paid, ad-free version of the streaming service for non-cable subscribers. That gives NBCU a subscriber pipeline back to traditional cable and a standalone paid subscription offering to compete in the crowded market for a slice of consumers' monthly entertainment budgets.\n\u201cWe think we can get around $5 a month from people who would use a free service,\" said NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke. CBS\nOne media giant that often flies under the radar in the streaming wars is CBS, which owns Showtime and CBS All Access . The latter has spent a modest original-content budget on a few big franchises, headlined by Star Trek: Discovery and additional upcoming Star Trek series; The Good Wife spin-off, The Good Fight ; a reimagining of The Twilight Zone from Jordan Peele (pictured above); and a coming adaptation of Stephen King's The Stand .\nCBS All Access is $5.99 a month with limited commercials or $9.99 a month without ads. Showtime is $10.99 for the standalone service, but you can buy or add the network to existing subscriptions through Prime Video, Amazon Fire TV, Hulu, Roku, Android, or iOS, or through a long list of cable and OTT streaming providers for varying prices. It's also available to existing cable subscribers as Showtime Anytime.\nCBS has been in the digital media and streaming games longer than most, going back to its 2004 deal to buy SportsLine (before CBS and Viacom split up in 2006) and CBS' subsequent acquisition of CNET for $1.8 billion in 2008. CBS has built its own streaming infrastructure atop that stack and now has its business firmly planted in all the big buckets: traditional cable and news, live sports, premium cable with Showtime, and a standalone streaming app in CBS All Access. In its Q4 2018 earnings, CBS reported 8 million streaming subscribers, including 2.5 million for CBS All Access.\nMarc DeBevoise, President and COO of CBS Interactive, spoke to PCMag about the company's choice not to invest in Hulu a decade ago along with Fox, NBC, and ABC/Disney.\n\"Our greatest gift was not doing the Hulu deal. Because we didn't, we saved our powder. That's where All Access was born,\" said DeBevoise. \"We felt we could go out and compete, because we had 160 million users in the US across our web properties and reserved libraries of content with over 100 series. By the time 2014-2015 came around, we were ready, whether the content rights were exclusive or not. Then we had the conversation of putting original content on [All Access] to move the needle.\"\n(Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images) Disney\nTo get a sense of where the broader entertainment and streaming industry is going for the long term, Disney's strategy may be the model to watch most closely. Disney's much-hyped Disney+ streaming service, set to launch in late 2019 , will cost less than Netflix\u2014Jeffrey Cole projects somewhere in the $6-to-$8 range per month\u2014and offer a small number of big-budget originals on top of the vast library of content already in the Disney vault.\nDisney has taken its time making a definitive, calculating, multi-stage entry into the streaming market, going back to 2016, when it invested $1 billion for a 33 percent stake in BAMTech. Formerly part of MLB Advanced Media (MLBAM), at one time the video-streaming company spun out of Major League Baseball powered streaming apps including MLB.TV, HBO Now , the NHL and PGA Tour apps, PlayStation Vue , and even the WWE Network streaming app.\nBAMTech's outside-consulting focus came to a halt when Disney bought another 42 percent stake to take majority control of BAMTech in 2017, and announced its direct-to-consumer streaming services, which would become ESPN+ and Disney+, in the same press release . ESPN+, which costs $4.99 a month or $49.99 per year, hit a million subscribers a few months after its launch.\nDisney's advantages outweigh its challenges as the Mouse enters the SVOD market. Armed with original Marvel and Star Wars series, the Disney and Pixar film vault, Disney Channel kids programming, and the 21st Century Fox catalog, including National Geographic, Disney+ looms large. JPMorgan projects Disney+ will eventually sign up more than 160 million subscribers\u2014compared with Netflix's current 139 million\u2014on the basis of its \"unmatched brand recognition, extensive premium content, and unparalleled ecosystem to market the service.\"\nBig-budget franchises like Marvel and Star Wars are key to Disney's business strategy in all their forms: from Disney book series and toys, to blockbuster films and TV shows, to cruise lines and theme parks such as the massive Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge parks opening in Disneyland and Disney World this summer. Disney's end-to-end pipeline is the most fully realized version of a true content-industrial complex, and the one piece missing until now was a streaming subscription service.\nAs the new players, including Apple, WarnerMedia, and NBCUniversal, have found (or will find out), building a streaming platform from scratch takes time. Rayburn described BAMTech as \"the special forces of our industry. They're the best at what they do, and they've been doing OTT streaming longer than anyone. And by the time Disney+ rolls out, it will still have taken them 18 months to build it.\"\nThe man building it is Joe Inzerillo, the CTO of Disney Streaming Services. Inzerillo is the former CTO of BAMTech and one of the founders of MLBAM. He oversees all Disney's video-streaming tech, including Disney+ and ESPN+ .\nWhile Inzerillo wouldn't comment on any specifics related to the content, original programming, or user interface of Disney+, he hinted to PCMag that Disney is cooking up some fresh storytelling mechanisms to bring its big, interconnected franchises\u2014the Marvel and Star Wars cinematic universes\u2014to viewers in fresh ways.\n\"The thing I find so incredibly compelling about [Marvel and Star Wars] is that it's they're one enormous narrative with a bunch of stories around it,\" said Inzerillo. \"So the user interface of a company's streaming service that makes epic sagas like that needs to be user-connected and one narrative designed to showcase the content for you and put it in front of the fans that love it, not get in the way. But it also needs to be personalized. It needs to be able to do all sorts of things. So it's the fusion of all those components to create this vision of a constant narrative.\" Welcome to the Streaming-Industrial Complex Now you know the players, let's break down the escalating war for original content and the tectonic shifts in an industry that's straddling the media, tech, and entertainment worlds. Then jump into the tech powering it all .

These are the things that remind us we're human.\" Granddaughter of Roy O. Disney, cofounder of The Walt Disney Company, Abigail is an heiress to the Disney fortune.

As he once told CNBC , it's \"the only thing that I do that costs a lot of money.\" But design trends in planes are evolving: Business Insider's Katie Warren previously reported that the super-wealthy no longer want their private jets to look like private jets.

Channing Tatum has been working on getting a Gambit movie made for years, but the film has been stuck in development hell all that time, largely due to difficulties in finding a director. Now, the project is sitting in limbo again for an entirely new reason, Disney is now the company that gets to decide if the movie even happens.\nThe merger between Fox and Disney was recently completed and as part of that, Disney has now inherited every film project that the previous studio had on the books. In many cases, we would expect that things will continue to move forward following the plan that was already made, but producer Simon Kinberg says that currently Disney is reevaluating many or all of the in-development Fox projects, including Gambit , though he expects everything will be fine. According to Kinberg...\nAll of the movies at Fox are being evaluated. I love the idea of Channing playing Gambit. I think we have a great script for it and I think it\u2019s a role he was born to play. It\u2019s a character I grew up loving and I know the fans love. So I suspect, I hope it will happen.\nSimon Kinberg had been one of the producers in charge of the entire X-Men universe over at Fox, going so far as to direct the upcoming Dark Phoenix . However, based on his comments to Variety , it doesn't sound like he's directly involved in the conversations at Disney regarding what to do with Gambit .\nA lot has been going on at the new Disney since the acquisition of Fox became official. Many layoffs have already taken place, and at least one film label has been shut down. However, if you're interest is purely on the content side, there're many decisions left to be made. The fact is that several upcoming projects, even some that fully expected to move forward, could still be axed now that there are new people at the top of the food chain. While the Fox label will continue to exist, it's unlikely the division will be producing as many movies as the studio was before Disney took over, so it's quite likely that a few movies we thought we were getting could end up disappearing.\nWhile Simon Kinberg thinks that Gambit has a good shot, because it has a solid actor cast in the lead and a good script, the fact is that it could still get chopped for any number of reasons. Everybody expects the X-Men to receive a franchise reboot at some point in order for them join the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Depending on what the timeline for such a move is, it's possible Gambit might conflict with those plans, and thus could end up not being made.\nAlternately, unless the recent rumor that Channing Tatum himself is interested in directing is true, the movie could still end up on the refuse pile if the new studio has no better luck finding a director.\nWe'll likely be hearing about the fate of a lot of different movies in the coming weeks and months as Disney continues to sort out its newfound empire.

Trade negotiations on track and Chinese manufacturing back into expansion territory.\nThe mood on Wall Street was positive after China\u2019s official manufacturing PMI released on Sunday showed a sharp bounce. Then, trader's spirits were lifted further on the back of US data (Analysts at Westpac offered a breakdown as follows):\nThe rise in the ISM manufacturing index was comforting \u2013 up from 54.2 in Feb to 55.3 in Mar - led by stronger new orders (+1.9pts to 57.4) and a sharp recovery in employment (+5.2pts to 57.5).

There may be an \"inclement weather\" effect with building materials down a huge -4.4% in the month.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average put on a decent 329 points, or 1.3%, to close around 26,258. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.3% to end around 7,829.

Eyes are now on the 2018 highs at 26951. Bears will otherwise target all the way down to the 23.6% Fibo retracement of the late Dec swing lows to late Feb swing highs at the low end of the twenty-five hundreds. This area guards a break all the way down to the 38.2% Fibo of the same range around 24400.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Image zoom NOELLEDOWNING/INSTAGRAM\nI don't know if you've been paying attention, but Walmart has seriously stepped its game up, \u2014 from beautiful furniture collections backed by Drew Barrymore to the Sofia Vergara -approved jeans . Now, the retailer is taking over the swimsuit arena, with its in-house Time and Tru collection of mix and match separates.\nAccording to Walmart reps (and the endless amounts of praise on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram), shoppers can't get enough of the best-selling bikinis by Time and Tru , which are made to fit sizes small all the way up to a 3x. And get this: the affordable designs are less than $18, so you'll have plenty of money leftover to sip pi\u00f1a coladas by the pool.\nWhat's even better are the functional details in the Time and Tru lineup, which include underwire finishes and adjustable straps to ensure the perfect fit, as endorsed by influencer Noelle Downing , who posted a sponsored post in the underwire bikini top ($16; walmart.com ) and lace-up bottoms ($16; walmart.com ) above. They're so good, in fact, that people are passing on Victoria's Secret push-up styles for Walmart's selects. One of InStyle 's Facebook followers tipped us off in the comment section underneath a VS post, admitting to finding awesome plus-size options at Wally World, for a fraction of the price. Image zoom FACEBOOK\nAnd Walmart's also giving Target's beloved swimsuits a run for their money. On Twitter Emmie wrote, \"I tried a lot on at Target and wasn\u2019t feeling it. Online Walmart!!! That\u2019s where I found two Time and Tru plus size swimsuits!\" I take that back!! I tried a lot on at target and wasn\u2019t feeling it. Online Walmart!!! That\u2019s where I found two. Time and tru plus size swimsuits! \u2014 Emmie\ud83c\udf4d (@Emmieejacq) March 23, 2019\nPeak season to grab the Time and Tru swimsuits is in May. But if you wait to late your favorite style or size might be sold out. So we'd suggest grabbing one of Walmart's best-sellling swimsuits, asap.

The one surprising fact Travel + Leisure recently discovered is actors dressed as Disney characters are never allowed to say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d to guests. People who are true Disney fans know they never want people to feel as though they need to wander around looking for information. So if someone asks a Disney Princess a question, the actor is expected to communicate with other employees or areas of the park in order to find the answer. For example, if you ask Elsa where the bathroom is, she's going to have to help you figure it out if she doesn't know! Another fun fact is if a guest is looking for general directions, there is protocol for how to point. Cast members are not allowed to use their index finger by itself. Instead, they use an open palm to show the way. The gesture was inspired by Walt Disney himself, who used to do it himself while walking around the park. It's considered rude in some cultures to point with your index finger.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "walt disney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elsa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "disney", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T03:42:30.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6ff359145569d8a846095a6870a19f44745ac96a", "url": "https://movieweb.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-james-gunn-rehired-zoe-saldana-responds/", "site_full": "movieweb.com", "site": "movieweb.com", "site_section": "http://movieweb.com/rss/movie-news", "site_categories": ["movies", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Movie News", "title": "Zoe Saldana on Guardians 3 James Gunn Rehiring: I'm So Proud of Disney", "title_full": "Zoe Saldana on Guardians 3 James Gunn Rehiring: I'm So Proud of Disney", "published": "2019-04-02T03:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn3.movieweb.com/i/article/xL41457tWPw4aY9hxPs2H6viaavmf9/1200:100/Guardians-Of-The-Galaxy-James-Gunn-Rehired-Zoe.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6785, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6ff359145569d8a846095a6870a19f44745ac96a", "url": "https://movieweb.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-james-gunn-rehired-zoe-saldana-responds/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Zoe Saldana on Guardians 3 James Gunn Rehiring: I'm So Proud of Disney", "text": "Comment\nZoe Saldana is just as happy as everyone else, if not more so, that James Gunn is back for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 . For those who need a quick refresher, Gunn was fired from the movie by Disney after a series of old, offensive tweets resurfaced last year. Then, recently, the studio had a change of heart and decided to rehire Gunn as director of the project to the delight of fans, as well as the cast. Now, Saldana has commented on the news and she's not only happy for her friend, but she feels Disney is setting a good example.\nWhen James Gunn was fired, indefensible as the content of those tweets may have been, many felt, the cast of the Guardians movies included, that Disney made the wrong call. Gunn sincerely apologized, for one, never deflecting and taking full credit for his words. He also, by virtually all accounts, is very much a different person than the man he was when he made those comments in the first place. Zoe Saldana was recently asked about Gunn being re-hired during an interview for her new movie Missing Link . Here's what she had to say about it. \"I'm proud of him. I'm happy that he's coming back. I'm so proud of Disney, actually, that all the leaders right now behind that big corporation decided to lead by example, and spreading the word and the message of redemption is important.\"\nIndeed, one of the core problems with Disney firing a guy like James Gunn was that it seemed to be sending a message that it doesn't matter if people genuinely change. In any event, things have sorted themselves out and the right man is back in the director's chair. Zoe Saldana, who plays Gamora in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, was also asked about the recent success of Captain Marvel . Saldana sang the movie's praises and shared her love for its star, Brie Larson. \"I loved it so much. I'm so proud of her [Brie Larson], I'm so proud of Marvel Studios. I'm also so happy that the public received it and they really supported it, because that was the main part of this whole equation. We need to go and support these movies with female leads in order for our corporations to understand that there is business in investing in female narratives. It's better representative of what America is today. It's no longer that shift of, 'Oh, can you allow this to happen?' It's more like you have to do it because if you don't you're neglecting 49 percent of your audience.\"\nAs it stands, James Gunn is getting ready to shoot The Suicide Squad for Warner Bros. and DC Films. Once that's in the can, he's heading back over to Marvel to tackle Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 , which doesn't currently have a release date set.

If you're so over the crowds on the weekends (and over 21), head over to Disney Springs for brunch at Wine Bar George . This past Saturday (March 30), the restaurant launched \"wine country brunch,\" which will serve Dole Whip Mimosas. Yup, you read that right. The beloved Disney dessert is being turned into an Instagram-able brunch cocktail. Yum! For those not well-versed in all things Disney World, Dole Whip is pineapple soft serve that's been a must-have treat in the parks since the '80s. As Disney World continues to become more of a foodie destination, Dole Whip has popped up on menus across the parks in many different ways. From Dole Whip upside down cake to doughnuts, there's a multitude of ways to satisfy your pineapple cravings. Now, Dole Whip fans will be able to try yet another iteration of the fan favorite treat. Wine Bar George's mimosa is made with pineapple juice, moscato and prosecco. Sounds good, right? According to Disney Food Blog , Wine Country Brunch will take place on Saturdays and Sundays from 11:00 a.m.-3:00p.m. and the menu will offer starters, boards, main plates, sweets, sides, and cocktails. The Dole Whip Mimosa isn't the only menu item to get excited for, either. Wine Country Brunch will offer delicious omelets, a cheese board with six artisanal cheeses, brioche french toast and crispy mac and cheese bites. Another exciting addition to Disney World's expanding dining options is the addition of the Baton Rouge Beignets aka Boozy Beignets at the Port Orleans French Quarter resort. They're offered at Scat Cat's Lounge and the classic pillow-shaped Beignets are complete with your choice of Baileys, Kahlua, or Rumchata to inject into the flaky dough. A year after boozy beignets made their debut at the most magical place on Earth, Disney Food Blog reported that there's now a secret menu version of the tasty treat : Godiva chocolate liqueur is now an option.

Matthews on Friday wasn\u2019t David Rickels \u2019 first win since what he called an \u201cembarrassing\u201d loss to Michael Page last May.\nIt was, however, just the type of win that he needed.\n\u201c(The Page fight) was a moment, where my heart was tested in the cage,\u201d Rickels told reporters, including MMA Junkie. \u201cAnd, when you have a moment like that, you want to have a comeback from that, you know what I mean? Like, I\u2019ve still got this (expletive) heart. I\u2019m still competitive in this game.\u201d\nRickels showed that by being hurt early, recovering, listening to his coaches and managing to score a win of his own after a punch rendered A.J. Matthews unable to continue. It wasn\u2019t the exact ending that Rickels wanted, as it took a doctor\u2019s call to end it, but it was still a finish \u2013 Rickels\u2019 first one in more than two years.\nRickels (21-5 MMA, 15-5 BMMA) and Matthews (9-9 MMA, 5-7 BMMA) met in the preliminary card of Friday\u2019s Bellator 219. The welterweight bout streamed live on MMA Junkie from Pechanga Resort Casino in Temecula, Calif.\nIt was a win that also came with some extra flair, too. Known for his inventive walk-outs, Rickels channeled \u201cStone Cold\u201d Steve Austin this time, complete with a \u201cStone Cold Stunner\u201d at the end. The routine, Rickels said, was for his kids, who were watching at home.\nAn overall shining night, however, did have its less positive moments.\nThroughout the initial minutes of the welterweight fight, Rickels kept losing his mouthpiece and the ref kept halting the action for him to put it back in. At one point, the ref even let the action continue for a bit before letting Rickels put it back in and issuing him a warning.\nBackstage, Rickels explained why he was having issued with this particular piece of equipment.\n\u201cI was straight-up embarrassed by it, because I had to go to (expletive) Walmart last minute and buy a new mouthpiece,\u201d Rickels said. \u201cI bought some damn $10 mouthpiece at Walmart, so if there\u2019s a mouthpiece sponsor out there, send me a goddamn mouthpiece that says \u2018Caveman\u2019 on it. Long story (short), my car got broken into and they stole my caveman mouthpiece.\u201d\nConsidering Rickels pulled a comeback as these repeated mouthguard incidents were happening, it\u2019s expected that some would question whether Rickels did it on purpose. But \u201cThe Caveman\u201d believes that, if anyone was helped by the situation, it wasn\u2019t him.\n\u201c(Expletive), I don\u2019t know, man,\u201d Rickels said. \u201cIf anything, it was helping him toward the end, because I had him hurt pretty bad. And then that (expletive) just kept jumping out, you know what I mean? I had him hurt and then I was trying to finish and it was jumping out.\n\u201cThankfully the ref was allowing me to still fight with the mouthpiece out, because I did have him hurt. It was a really weird situation, but got the finish regardless. I was really wanting to (expletive) go toe-to-toe toward the end, but his (expletive) is pretty swollen, so.\u201d\nEven the finish had to come with a little bit of, let\u2019s say, added emotion. After a succession of punches, Matthews got a time out for what he claimed had been an eye poke and, though replays would eventually show it was actually a punch that rendered him unable to continue, Rickels was worried about it for a few seconds.\n\u201cI was worried that he was going to get like an eye poke win, you know what I mean?\u201d Rickels said. \u201cI was like, \u2018(expletive) punched that mother(expletive). I was hoping that they\u2019d check out the replay and they\u2019d clear me. Obviously, everything played out the way it should have.\u201d\nHurdles aside, it was ultimately a good night for Rickels. And he got to share it with some pretty special people.\n\u201cI used to never let my kids watch my fights and I\u2019m like, \u2018Man, (expletive) that, they need to see what heart looks like,\u2019\u201d Rickels said. \u201cAnd, hey, I got to show them today.\u201d\nTo hear from Rickels, check out the video above.\nAnd for complete coverage of Bellator 219 , check out the MMA Events section of the site.

Toy Story 4 introduces Forky (Tony Hale), a homemade toy who refuses to believe he's a toy and who inadvertently drags Woody (Tom Hanks) on another long-distance adventure. The film will also reunite Woody with the long-lost Bo Peep (Annie Potts) and introduce a new villain named Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks). Inside Out's John Cooley is directing the sequel, with the screenplay written by Stephany Folsom and Andrew Stanton.\nPixar's Toy Story 4 is scheduled for release on June 21, 2019. Frozen 2 Exit Theatre Mode\nWith Frozen becoming one of Disney's biggest animation successes in recent memory, it should come as no surprise that a sequel is on the way. Frozen 2 reunites Elsa (Idina Menzel), Anna (Kristen Bell), Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and Olaf (Josh Gad) for a new adventure that takes them beyond the icy borders of Arendelle. Evan Rachel Wood and Sterling K. Brown also join the cast. Directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck are returning, with Lee and Allison Schroeder writing the screenplay.\nFrozen 2 is scheduled for release on November 22, 2019. Onward\nPixar's next film after Toy Story 4 will be an original project called Onward. This film is set in a \"suburban fantasy world\" where humans don't exist and creatures like elves, trolls and unicorns are commonplace. Onward revolves around two elf brothers (Chris Pratt and Tom Holland) who seek a magical way of reuniting with their late father. Octavia Spencer and Julia Louis-Dreyfus will also provide voices.\nOnward is written and directed by Dan Scanlon (Monsters University) and is scheduled for release on March 6, 2020. Unknown Movies\nThere are a number of mystery animated movies where we only have release dates, not titles. Currently, Disney has dates set aside for three mystery animated movies - November 25, 2020, November 24, 2021 and November 23, 2022. The 2020 date had been reserved for Gigantic until that film was indefinitely shelved (see below).\nAs for Pixar, there are currently four dates reserved for films after Onward's March 2020 debut - June 19, 2020, June 18, 2021, March 18, 2022 and June 17, 2022.\nWe don't have any further concrete info on these mystery projects yet. One of these Disney projects is reportedly a collaboration between Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda and Tangled/Zootopia co-director Byron P. Howard. Another rumor suggests Disney is moving forward with a sequel to 1993's A Nightmare Before Christmas. Pixar is said to developing an animated movie inspired by the football team FC Barcelona. And given Pixar's trend of mixing sequels with original efforts, we'd assume at least one of these mystery Pixar movies is a sequel to an existing franchise. Rumored Projects Dragon Empire\nWhile Disney has yet to make an official announcement, the studio is reportedly developing a new movie called Dragon Empire. This fantasy movie will be set in Asia and, rumor has it, revolve around a heroine named Jan-Nin and her travelling companion Bolin.\nFrozen and Big Hero 6's Paul Briggs is said to be directing the film. It's speculated that Dragon Empire may be claiming the November 25, 2020 release date vacated by the now-dormant Gigantic (see below). Reportedly Cancelled Gigantic\nAnimation is a tricky business, and many Disney movies faced a rocky journey from conception to actual release. That's definitely true of Gigantic. This new take on Jack and the Beanstalk is described as being set in Spain during the Age of Exploration, with tiny Jack befriending a giant woman.\nUnfortunately, it may be a while before this project sees the light of day. Disney originally announced Gigantic (then known as Giants) at the D23 Expo in 2015. The studio eventually brought in Inside Out's Meg LeFauve to co-direct alongside original director Nathan Greno (Tangled). The film has continued face behind-the-scenes troubles, however. Disney pushed the release date from November 21, 2018 to November 25, 2020 and has now pulled Gigantic from the schedule altogether. According to Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios president Ed Catmull, the film is \"ending active development for now\" and its November 2020 release date will be filled by another unnamed film. Planes 3\nThe Planes series is a spinoff of the wildly successful Cars franchise, and a third movie was announced with a release date of April 12, 2019. Unfortunately, the project was canceled as a result of Disney shuttering its DisneyToon Studios branch.\nAll we know about the plot of the film is that it would have been set partly in outer space. While Planes 3 appears to be dead, there's no telling if it might be revived under a different department down the road. Perhaps as an exclusive to the Disney+ streaming service?\nJesse is a mild-mannered writer for IGN.

Some franchises colliding, such as the Avengers and X-Men , feel likely. Others, like Lisa Simpson becoming a Disney princess, aren't as probable but voice actress Yeardley Smith admitted recently she's a fan:\nWhat\u2019s funny is we actually almost recorded a promo where Lisa was excited that she gets to be a Disney princess. I\u2019m excited. Any tiara, anytime, anywhere and any form, sign me up.\nThat's right Disney, Yeardley Smith is ready to get in on that sweet princess action. Of course, the fact that Lisa isn't actually a royal princess may hurt her chances of inclusion, so the show or Disney would have to enact some changes to the premise to make that possible. Smith told Variety she didn't know if Disney had plans to use its power to change the series in any way, but mentioned the idea is a \"risky proposition.\"\nYeardley Smith may have reservations about Disney potentially changing The Simpsons , but injecting the dysfunctional family into other Disney properties is alright by her. When asked about her opinion of Homer being a part of Marvel's Avengers down the line or Lisa having a cameo in a Frozen film, she was ready to sign on the dotted line.\nOh, I think that\u2019s a good idea. I like that, that\u2019s sort of again in the Lisa/Disney princess sort of vein. I\u2019m all about that.\nOf course, Disney isn't just in the business of giving just any character they own the title of Disney Princess . While newer characters like Moana and Elsa have been added in recent years, the company has balked at adding Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia into the mix. Other characters like Hercules ' Meg and Kida from Atlantis: The Lost Empire aren't canon Disney princesses either, despite being prominent characters of Disney animated features. Does Lisa Simpson really stand a chance?\nProbably not, but who knows how this marriage between Fox and Disney will ultimately shape the future? The next decade will surely bring some interesting Fox/Disney crossovers the world would've never expected before, so perhaps Lisa's day as a Disney princess is coming. Until then, she can always hold onto her brief reign as the \"Lizard Queen\" of Duff Gardens.\nThe Simpsons is on Fox Sundays at 8:00 p.m. ET and on FXX quite often in the evenings. Fans can get their fix by tuning into either station, and can keep up with the rampant entertainment news cycle by reading CinemaBlend.

Well, this is too much to handle for us, Miley! \u2014 Miley Ray Cyrus (@MileyCyrus) March 29, 2019 Despite a range of new series that we get to consume every day, there's no taking for granted the impact that Hannah \"legendary\" Montana left on us. There's no forgetting the time when all we wanted was to be part of her two different lives. It's totally one of the greatest shows of our childhood! And since Miley already started it, we're here to reminisce the best of both worlds in the Hannah Montana universe. Let's go back to Disney Channel circa 2006, shall we? 1. The Miley-Lilly Duo Miley and Lilly defined the ultimate friendship goals back then! These two taught us that in all of life's adventures and dramas, true friends stay honest, supportive, and reliable\u2014even when they're living double lives! 2. Miley's expressions It's so impossible not to notice the cast's handful of funny and remarkable lines which, perhaps, have slipped into your everyday expressions unconsciously. From \"say what?\" to \"sweet niblets,\" we bet you all know it by heart. 3. Hannah's jams Songs come and go with time but not Hannah Montana's. Remember when \"Best of Both Worlds\" is what we sounded like when we breathe? Yup, we still do. 4. The fashion transformations There was a time when we'll willingly exchange our closet with Miley and Hannah just to live like a sassy student by day and a glitzy diva by night. We're pretty sure that you've copied more than one outfit from her when you were younger! 4. The surprise guests The Jonas Brothers, Selena Gomez, Ashley Tisdale\u2014you name it. Hannah Montana has the best celebrity guests and Disney crossovers in television history! 5. The double life of Miley and Hannah Truth be told, it wasn't easy for Miley Stewart and Hannah Montana to live two different lives but she totally nailed it.

By Jesse Schedeen\nThese days it might seem like Disney is too busy remaking classic animated movies in live-action to actually have time for new animated projects, but that's anything but the case. From sequels to Frozen and Toy Story to intriguing new fare like Onward and Dragon Empire, both Disney and Pixar will be keeping the animation fire burning in the years to come.\nHere's a quick breakdown of all the new animated Disney movies in the works, as well as some rumored and cancelled projects. (Note that we're not including upcoming Fox animated movies, even though those will technically be distributed by Disney.) Read on for the full list! Toy Story 4\nDespite the fact that Toy Story 3 seemed to tidily wrap up the series, Woody and the gang are returning for a fourth adventure. Toy Story 4 introduces Forky (Tony Hale), a homemade toy who refuses to believe he's a toy and who inadvertently drags Woody (Tom Hanks) on another long-distance adventure. The film will also reunite Woody with the long-lost Bo Peep (Annie Potts) and introduce a new villain named Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks). Inside Out's John Cooley is directing the sequel, with the screenplay written by Stephany Folsom and Andrew Stanton.\nPixar's Toy Story 4 is scheduled for release on June 21, 2019. Frozen 2\nWith Frozen becoming one of Disney's biggest animation successes in recent memory, it should come as no surprise that a sequel is on the way. Frozen 2 reunites Elsa (Idina Menzel), Anna (Kristen Bell), Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and Olaf (Josh Gad) for a new adventure that takes them beyond the icy borders of Arendelle. Evan Rachel Wood and Sterling K. Brown also join the cast. Directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck are returning, with Lee and Allison Schroeder writing the screenplay.\nFrozen 2 is scheduled for release on November 22, 2019. Onward\nPixar's next film after Toy Story 4 will be an original project called Onward. This film is set in a \"suburban fantasy world\" where humans don't exist and creatures like elves, trolls and unicorns are commonplace. Onward revolves around two elf brothers (Chris Pratt and Tom Holland) who seek a magical way of reuniting with their late father. Octavia Spencer and Julia Louis-Dreyfus will also provide voices.\nOnward is written and directed by Dan Scanlon (Monsters University) and is scheduled for release on March 6, 2020. Unknown Movies\nThere are a number of mystery animated movies where we only have release dates, not titles. Currently, Disney has dates set aside for three mystery animated movies - November 25, 2020, November 24, 2021 and November 23, 2022. The 2020 date had been reserved for Gigantic until that film was indefinitely shelved (see below).\nAs for Pixar, there are currently four dates reserved for films after Onward's March 2020 debut - June 19, 2020, June 18, 2021, March 18, 2022 and June 17, 2022.\nWe don't have any further concrete info on these mystery projects yet. One of these Disney projects is reportedly a collaboration between Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda and Tangled/Zootopia co-director Byron P. Howard. Another rumor suggests Disney is moving forward with a sequel to 1993's A Nightmare Before Christmas. Pixar is said to developing an animated movie inspired by the football team FC Barcelona. And given Pixar's trend of mixing sequels with original efforts, we'd assume at least one of these mystery Pixar movies is a sequel to an existing franchise. Rumored Projects Dragon Empire\nWhile Disney has yet to make an official announcement, the studio is reportedly developing a new movie called Dragon Empire. This fantasy movie will be set in Asia and, rumor has it, revolve around a heroine named Jan-Nin and her travelling companion Bolin.\nFrozen and Big Hero 6's Paul Briggs is said to be directing the film. It's speculated that Dragon Empire may be claiming the November 25, 2020 release date vacated by the now-dormant Gigantic (see below). Reportedly Cancelled Gigantic\nAnimation is a tricky business, and many Disney movies faced a rocky journey from conception to actual release. That's definitely true of Gigantic. This new take on Jack and the Beanstalk is described as being set in Spain during the Age of Exploration, with tiny Jack befriending a giant woman.\nUnfortunately, it may be a while before this project sees the light of day. Disney originally announced Gigantic (then known as Giants) at the D23 Expo in 2015. The studio eventually brought in Inside Out's Meg LeFauve to co-direct alongside original director Nathan Greno (Tangled). The film has continued face behind-the-scenes troubles, however. Disney pushed the release date from November 21, 2018 to November 25, 2020 and has now pulled Gigantic from the schedule altogether. According to Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios president Ed Catmull, the film is \"ending active development for now\" and its November 2020 release date will be filled by another unnamed film. Planes 3\nThe Planes series is a spinoff of the wildly successful Cars franchise, and a third movie was announced with a release date of April 12, 2019. Unfortunately, the project was canceled as a result of Disney shuttering its DisneyToon Studios branch.\nAll we know about the plot of the film is that it would have been set partly in outer space. While Planes 3 appears to be dead, there's no telling if it might be revived under a different department down the road. Perhaps as an exclusive to the Disney+ streaming service?\nJesse is a mild-mannered writer for IGN.

Disney worked hard to earn degrees from prestigious schools to \"feel legitimate\" and has donated more than $70 million of her fortune to date. Disney now tells her four children that money doesn't make someone a good or a bad person, and encourages them \"to earn it in reverse.\"\nAbigail Disney started feeling uneasy about her family's wealth by the time she was in her 20s.\nIn a recent interview with The Cut , the 59-year-old granddaughter of Walt Disney Company cofounder Roy Disney said her parents' wealth had reached new heights by the time she went off to college. \" So all of the sudden, we went from being comfortable, upper-middle-class people to suddenly my dad had a private jet,\" Disney, an award-winning documentary filmmaker, said. \"That's when I feel that my dad really lost his way in life. And that's why I feel hyperconscious about what wealth does to people. I lived in one family as a child, and then I didn't even recognize the family as I got older.\"\nDisney told the Cut that the fortune she inherited would have made her \"a billionaire if I wanted to be a billionaire,\" but instead she \"wore sh---- clothes,\" worked hard to hide her wealth from classmates and friends in graduate school, earned degrees from Yale, Stanford, and Columbia to \"feel legitimate,\" and began donating even more money than her parents had.\n\"I was embarrassed by it. I didn't want anyone to know,\" Disney said, adding that her family's wealth bred deep self-doubt and an \" inferiority complex around people who have actually earned their money .\"\nTo date, Disney has donated around $70 million and plans to keep \"giving a lot of money away\" until her death, she said. Disney, along with her husband Pierre Hauser, is the cofounder of the Daphne Foundation , which supports programs to end poverty in New York City. Her production company, Fork Films , focuses on documentaries about international social issues.\nStill, Disney's four children have adopted a familiar skepticism of wealth, which she's attempted to wring from them, she said.\n\"I keep trying to tell them that money is morally neutral,\" Disney said. \"It does not, in and of itself, make you a bad person. It also does not, in and of itself, makes you a good person. You are who you are and the least important thing about you is what you have.\" As Disney puts it, \"you try to earn it in reverse.\"\nBillionaire Warren Buffett has shared similar advice with his children, who are set to inherit at least part of their father's fortune. Buffett told his children to use their talents to pursue whatever path will most benefit society, not the path they feel is expected of them or the most prestigious or lucrative, Forbes reported .\nBillionaire Bill Gates agrees. \"It's not a favor to kids to have them have huge sums of wealth,\" Gates said in 2016 . \"It distorts anything they might do, creating their own path.\" Read the full story on The Cut \u00bb Personal Finance Insider offers tools and calculators to help you make smart decisions with your money.

It\u2019s offering two-hour delivery in some markets, a speedy service few retailers are in position to match. And its popular, voice-activated Alexa devices and software have put it at the centre of the emerging trend of shopping via virtual assistants.\nThere is one important area, though, where Amazon\u2019s strategy looks much fuzzier: Click-and-collect. This hybrid of online and physical shopping is proving popular, and it could potentially prove a costly mistake for Amazon that it hasn\u2019t moved more quickly to get a piece of the action.\nA new report from Cowen & Co estimates that curbside grocery pickup will account for US$35bil (RM142.94bil) in sales in the US by 2020 as it is embraced by a greater proportion of consumers.\nThis is a model that\u2019s well-suited for traditional retailers. They are in a good position to scale up quickly, and they are doing just that. Target Corp\u2019s Drive Up service is offered at about 1,000 stores and will be in all stores by the end of 2019. Walmart Inc\u2019s grocery pickup programme is available at about 2,100 stores and will be in 3,100 stores by the end of the fiscal year.(1)\nBoth Walmart and Target say their net promoter scores \u2013 a key measure of customer satisfaction \u2013 are especially high for curbside services. And the click-and collect push is making a difference. Cowen analysts estimate that Walmart grocery pickup is contributing significantly to the retailer\u2019s overall US comparable sales growth. They forecast Walmart\u2019s US comparable sales will increase 2.8% for the current fiscal year from the prior year, and that grocery pickup will account for between 0.9 and 1.3 percentage points.\nIt\u2019s not that Amazon is sitting idly by when it comes to this digital-physical shopping mashup. It has two locations of AmazonFresh Pickup in Seattle, a drive-up spot for retrieving groceries. Its Whole Foods Market chain has rolled out click-and-collect services in 22 cities. And beyond the grocery segment, Amazon has a limited number of pickup centres and lockers. It all adds up to a smattering of tentative moves \u2013 not a cohesive strategy that can ramp up quickly nationwide.\nOn some level, it makes sense that Amazon isn\u2019t a leader in click-and-collect. It will be harder for it to make such an operation profitable when it is building its stable of pickup points from scratch (or via acquisition, in the case of Whole Foods). And I suppose Amazon could convince itself click-and-collect isn\u2019t an end game for e-commerce, but merely a bridge format that offers some measure of convenience before technology such as driverless cars, drones and smart-home entry systems make doorstep delivery \u2013 which Amazon dominates \u2013 more economical for sellers and more appealing for shoppers.\nBut there are downsides for Amazon in not more aggressively pursuing click-and-collect sales.\nFor one, even if click-and-collect fades as a format at some point, it is serving as an entry point to the wider digital ecosystems of the likes of Walmart, Target and Kroger Co, cultivating digital loyalty to those brands. It might prove hard for Amazon to elbow its way into a given customer\u2019s online routine once that relationship has been established.\nAnd there\u2019s a rather strong possibility that pickup is here to stay. It has particular appeal in suburbs, where shoppers spend a good chunk of their day in cars. Pickup, unlike same-day delivery, typically doesn\u2019t come with a fee, which may hold ongoing sway for budget-conscious consumers.\nAmazon obviously sees value in becoming a so-called multi-channel retailer, given its acquisition of Whole Foods and its reported plans of creating yet another grocery chain. But the window is closing for Amazon to develop a serious click-and-collect strategy that can compete with the maturing ones its competitors have already built. It should be moving faster to make this service more widely available via Whole Foods. Or perhaps it could even establish some outside-the-box way of adding pickup points quickly. Think, for example, of its pilot partnership with Kohl\u2019s Corp, in which customers can make returns of Amazon purchases at the department store.\nAmazon is such a formidable retailing force, maybe being an also-ran at click-and-collect won\u2019t be so terrible for it. But the e-commerce heavyweight will be better off if it gets more skin in the game.\n(1) Both retailers have additional click-and-collect programmes that allow customers to pick up online orders at a counter in the store. \u2013 Bloomberg", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "walmart", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "amazon.com inc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cowen & co", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T13:41:08.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "68b106282260c38eefa17445659c3778d5223754", "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-sg/money/topstories/a-disney-heiress-who-has-donated-dollar70-million-over-the-past-30-years-says-she-would-outlaw-private-jets-if-she-could/ar-BBVwyvn", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "https://www.msn.com/en-sg/money", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "Stock quotes, financial tools, news and analysis - MSN Singapore Money", "title": "A Disney heiress who has donated $70 million over the past 30 years says she would outlaw private jets if she could", "title_full": "A Disney heiress who has donated $70 million over the past 30 years says she would outlaw private jets if she could", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "68b106282260c38eefa17445659c3778d5223754", "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-sg/money/topstories/a-disney-heiress-who-has-donated-dollar70-million-over-the-past-30-years-says-she-would-outlaw-private-jets-if-she-could/ar-BBVwyvn", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Hillary Hoffower", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "A Disney heiress who has donated $70 million over the past 30 years says she would outlaw private jets if she could", "text": "A Disney heiress who has donated $70 million over the past 30 years says she would outlaw private jets if she could Business Insider 13 hrs ago Hillary Hoffower \u00a9 Amanda Edwards/Getty Images Private jets allow rich people to \"get around a certain reality,\" Disney heiress Abigail Disney told The Cut . Disney said that though her family had a 737 private jet, she decided to stop using it once she considered her carbon footprint and the cost her trips incurred. Private jets are popular purchases among many millionaires and billionaires looking for quick and easy travel. Mark Cuban , Jeff Bezos , and other billionaires may own private jets, but heiress Abigail Disney has a different set of thoughts on the topic.\n\"If I were queen of the world, I would pass a law against private jets, because they enable you to get around a certain reality,\" Abigail Disney recently told The Cut . \"You don't have to go through an airport terminal, you don't have to interact, you don't have to be patient, you don't have to be uncomfortable. These are the things that remind us we're human.\"\nGranddaughter of Roy O. Disney, cofounder of The Walt Disney Company, Abigail is an heiress to the Disney fortune. While she stayed mum on the exact size of her inheritance, she told The Cut that she could be a billionaire if she wanted and that she's donated more than $70 million since turning 21.\nHer dad's plane was a 737 with a queen-sized bed and a shower, she said: \"We would use the plane occasionally because I have four kids, so it was much easier, obviously, to ride on my dad's plane with them. Then, at a certain point, I just said, 'No, I think this is really bad for everybody.'\"\nThat defining moment, she told The Cut, came after thinking about her carbon footprint and the cost of her trip while riding on the jet alone for a quick trip from New York to California.\n: An heiress to the Disney fortune has given away $70 million, and teaches her kids that money is the least important thing about them\nOwning a private jet is typically a hallmark among millionaires and billionaires, especially high-powered executives and investors working in the tech industry. For them, a private jet can allow for quick and easy travel if they need to be on the other coast the same day, according to Business Insider's Paige Leskin .\nEven the notoriously frugal Warren Buffett has his own private jet. As he once told CNBC , it's \"the only thing that I do that costs a lot of money.\"\nBut design trends in planes are evolving: Business Insider's Katie Warren previously reported that the super-wealthy no longer want their private jets to look like private jets.

The New Streaming Giants Explained Between Netflix, Amazon and Apple, and the media conglomerates such as Disney all launching their ow Rob Marvin 2 Apr 2019, 12:56 a.m.\nThe video-streaming industry is crowded with big names\u2014some with already-existing services and others with impending apps. Considering the current three largest platforms, the agglomeration of media companies, and the tech companies investing heavily in video, it can be hard to wrap your head around the sheer scope of the entertainment giants that make up this market.\nEach service has its own origin story, business interests, and exclusive originals and licensed content. There's also a wide assortment of fluctuating prices, packages and plans, and technology under the surface .\n\"We're seeing a ton of fragmentation,\" said streaming media consultant and expert Dan Rayburn . \"NBCUniversal is coming out with a service, Disney, WarnerMedia, Viacom bought PlutoTV, Amazon launched IMDb Freedive , and on and on. Netflix, Hulu, Facebook, YouTube, Amazon Prime, HBO...as consumers we're inundated with video everywhere we look.\"\nHere are the most important streaming services to watch in the next hyper-competitive phase of this industry, including interviews with execs from Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, CBS, and Disney, as well as industry analysts and experts. Netflix\nThe modern streaming industry begins and ends with what many have dubbed the \"Netflix Effect\": Regardless of how many Oscars, Emmys, or Golden Globe Awards the one-time DVD delivery service does or doesn't win , Netflix's digital subscription model and its massive investment in originals have set the bar for the market. Netflix reported 58 million US subscribers in September and 139 million subscribers worldwide in Q4.\nThe company generated $1.2 billion in annual net profit on $15.8 billion of revenue in 2018, giving it a current market valuation of around $154 billion, according to Bloomberg. Netflix keeps burning cash and raising debt financing to fund its original-content creation, but for now, the strategy is working. The service adds millions of subscribers around the globe each quarter.\nEven a recent price hike isn't expected to dent Netflix's subscriber base much. Jeffrey Cole, a Research Professor at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, and Director of USC's Center for the Digital Future , believes Netflix could be charging a lot more.\n\"It must drive [Netflix founder and CEO] Reed Hastings crazy that a dozen years ago in the red-envelope days, he gave you five DVDs at a time and unlimited streaming for $16 a month. Now he's giving you not just five theatrical films at a time but dozens or hundreds plus massive amounts of old television shows and $12 billion worth of originals for $9 or $13 or $16 a month,\" said Cole, who has researched the television, media, and streaming industries for almost three decades .\n\"If you paid $16 for five DVDs, you should pay $40 for what you're getting now. But when Netflix broke the company in half, each side priced down at $8. So Netflix is already handicapped by how much it can charge,\" added Cole. \"How much it can spend on originals depends on how fast it grows, and its growth is international. It will hit a wall...the only question is when.\"\nNetflix is ramping up other revenue streams, including a reported expansion of its ad business with more product placement in originals such as Queer Eye . And despite spending more than $1 billion a year on technology, CEO Reed Hastings still positions Netflix as more of a media company akin to Disney than a tech company like Apple or Amazon. Netflix is \"mostly a content company powered by tech,\" he told Recode in response to a question about industry regulation.\nThat posturing is largely semantic; in reality, modern streaming players are all media, entertainment, and tech companies rolled into one. Amazon Prime Video\nUnlike Netflix, Amazon has no discernible caps on how much it can spend, and its business model isn't dependent on video subscribers. Amazon confirmed in 2018 that it has more than 100 million Prime members, and Prime Video's US audience was around 26 million as of last year, Reuters reports .\nPrime Video's core value is to drive more Prime subscriptions at $119 a pop per year, which last year went up from $99 in the first price hike since 2014. So Amazon has no qualms about shelling out billions for original series and films on the indie festival circuit through Amazon Studios. Standalone Prime Video costs $8.99 per month.\nAmazon also owns Prime Video's underlying infrastructure. Streaming high-quality live and on-demand video requires a complicated content-delivery pipeline, from data hosting and storage to encoding and packaging files, all the way down to content delivery networks (CDNs) and playback. Amazon controls the pipes, and Prime Video can enjoy seemingly infinite scale thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nOther streaming platforms need Amazon's cloud, too. Netflix, for instance, spent years and untold millions building out its own global CDN network (the only streaming provider to do so) but relies entirely on AWS for cloud computing and storage.\n\"We package up and have built our technology infrastructure on top of AWS,\" said Girish Bajaj, VP of Software Engineering for Amazon Prime Video. \"Because we serve millions of customers and operate this massive amount of scale, it gives both Prime Video and AWS expertise in how to actually operate these systems, and with that level of scale comes cost savings that we then are able to offer back to customers on the consumer side as well as the enterprise side.\"\n(Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images) Apple\nAmazon has been competing with Netflix for years, but Apple's high-profile entry into the streaming landscape has the potential to further tip the balance of power toward the tech industry.\nLast week, Apple unveiled its Apple TV+ and Apple TV Channels services. TV Channels is coming in May with a major Apple TV software update, and TV+ will be available this fall in over 100 countries. The redesigned Apple TV app is also coming to more form factors, including Roku and Amazon Fire TV devices, and smart TVs from Samsung, Sony, LG, and Vizio.\nThe new Apple TV app will offer original content through the Apple TV+, as well as streaming app and network subscriptions through TV Channels, which is similar to the add-ons offered by Prime Video and Hulu. We don't know what Apple TV+ will cost yet, but Apple confirmed it will be an ad-free subscription service, seemingly disproving reports that Apple TV and iOS users would get access to Apple's original content for free. However, both TV+ and TV Channels will be available to other users in a household via Apple's Family Sharing.\nThrough TV Channels, Apple aims to bring an App Store-like gatekeeper approach to controlling streaming content on iOS devices, and will reportedly take a 30 percent cut on every streaming app subscription through its service. That's a steep commission, but in line with the 30 percent it currently takes on premium app and streaming-service subscriptions through the App Store . The commission drops to 15 percent for subscription renewals.\nTV Channels is launching in May with some big partners, including Amazon Prime Video, HBO, Hulu, Showtime, Starz, CBS All Access , and many others (but not Netflix); Apple showcased Prime Video originals such as The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel in demos during its launch event. TV Channels will also let users choose traditional cable bundles from providers such as Optimum and Spectrum, as well as over-the-top (OTT) cable replacement services including DirecTV Now and PlayStation Vue. Apple's Grand Designs\nThis strategy is part of Apple's broader push into software and services: It has grand designs to expand to several other industries beyond the steadily growing chunk of recurring revenue it currently makes from iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple Pay. Amid stagnating iPhone sales , Apple's glossy launch event for its new slate of services highlights how Apple sees its future growth.\nApple, like Amazon, owns its data centers, so every new service it releases holds tantalizing profit margins. Along with its new streaming offerings, Apple also unveiled its $9.99-per-month Apple News+ service for a bundled subscription to 300 magazines and newspapers, its Apple Arcade games subscription service, and the Goldman Sachs-backed Apple Card .\nFor all of these services\u2014particularly where it's aggregating content under its own banner\u2014Apple will take a hefty cut. The Wall Street Journal reported that the tech giant is demanding 50 percent from news publishers for Apple News+, which is built on Apple's acquisition of Texture , described as a \"Netflix for magazines.\"\nAs for original content, Apple's shows will reportedly be family-friendly ; no sex, violence, or profanity from Cupertino. When adding yet another online content platform to the digital media pile, banning R-rated content of any kind is certainly one way for Apple to differentiate its originals. That, and signing Oprah to make documentaries and bring back her book club as Apple exclusives.\n\u201cI think entertainment's going to become a key element of Apple's business,\u201d said USC's Jeffrey Cole. \u201cFor them, spending $2 billion on [original content] is just dabbling. If they like what they see, I think they'll have a $10 billion budget.\u201d Hulu\nThe third established veteran in the market, Hulu is a particularly intriguing player given its new mouse-shaped overlord. Hulu now has 25 million subscribers across its ad-supported, ad-free, and Hulu + Live TV services; it declined to break down that number into specific subscriber totals in an interview with PCMag.\nWith Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox, the entertainment powerhouse also picked up Fox's 30 percent stake in Hulu, giving it a majority 60 percent (it already owned 30 percent). Variety reports that Disney is in negotiations with AT&T to pick up an additional 10 percent stake, leaving Comcast/NBCUniversal's remaining 30 percent as the only outside ownership stake in a streaming platform that has long represented the network TV industry's collective streaming interests. Not anymore.\n\"Hulu really benefited, I think, by being owned by a handful of studios. Now it's basically a division of Disney,\" said USC's Cole.\nBut Cole doesn't believe Comcast will relinquish its Hulu stake for less than a kingly price. He cited Comcast's ultimately failed $65 million bid to steal 21st Century Fox away from Disney and the open secret of bad blood between Comcast CEO Brian Roberts and Disney chief Bob Iger.\nBeatrice Springborn, Vice President of Content Development at Hulu, said the service doesn't measure success by nightly ratings or individual show performance. It's about getting new subscribers to sign up for Hulu, watch a lot of content on the platform, and remain subscribers for the long haul.\nAs for how Disney's streaming plans will affect Hulu, Springborn said the company is staying the course until directed otherwise.\n\"It is impossible to predict the future, but we do know that Hulu is a major strategic asset for all of our owners. Hulu added 8 million subscribers last year, and that kind of growth is only possible when you have owners that support you and are aligned with your strategy,\" said Springborn. \"There is a lot of noise and speculation about transactions right now, but our teams are staying laser-focused on making Hulu the number-one choice for TV.\"\nFollowing Netflix's price increase, Hulu took the opposite route and cut the price of its entry-level ad-supported plan from $7.99 to $5.99 per month. But it did raise the price of its Hulu + Live TV plan package from $39.99 to $44.99 per month. WarnerMedia\nWarnerMedia is the most recent example of high-profile corporate consolidation fueling the next wave of streaming services. The newly formed pool of media brands and TV channels centralizes AT&T's Time Warner assets under one streaming roof .\nAT&T's major corporate restructuring of WarnerMedia was enacted shortly after the long-awaited regulatory approval of its merger with HBO and Turner parent company Time Warner. (HBO and Turner initially agreed to participate in this story but dropped out shortly before their scheduled interviews, in the wake of the sudden resignations of longtime HBO chief Richard Plepler and Turner head David Levy.)\nThe major changes approved by AT&T exec John Stankey (pictured above) include installing former NBC and Showtime head Bob Greenblatt as the new chairman of WarnerMedia Entertainment, the division handling WarnerMedia's TV assets and direct-to-consumer operations. He will oversee the group's crown jewel\u2014its forthcoming streaming platform combining all the content from HBO, TNT, TBS, TruTV, CNN, the CW, Warner Bros. and DC Comics films, Cartoon Network, and more under a single app.\nHBO will still be offered as a standalone service , but all of the premium cable network's original series, movies, documentaries, and so on will also be incorporated into the as-yet-unnamed WarnerMedia streaming service, which is targeted to launch in Q4 2019. We don't know pricing details, but Stankey said it'll be more expensive than HBO Now's current $14.99-per-month cost, which will put AT&T's service at the high end of the price continuum. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said on an earnings call that the new service will have a \"two-sided business model\" with both a premium tier offering commercial-free programming and a more affordable ad-supported tier akin to Hulu.\nAT&T's first foray into OTT streaming, DirecTV Now , hasn't enjoyed long-term success. It went with the cable-replication model of bundling channels together into various digital packages, similar to other Virtual Multichannel Programming Distributors (vMVPDs) such as Hulu + Live TV, Sling, PlayStation Vue, FuboTV, and YouTube TV. But as competition has increased, DirecTV Now subscribers have been fleeing in droves . The service lost 267,000 subscribers in Q4 of 2018 alone, and it has raised prices twice in the past year: a $5 increase last July and another $10 hike in March.\nThe telecommunications giant's move to buy Time Warner exemplifies a corporate-level shift across the industry away from that costly standalone model and into Subscription Video On-Demand (SVOD) with its WarnerMedia streaming service.\n\"We've been talking about cord-cutting for years and the death of cable for a decade, but how many subscribers do these services have?\" said Dan Rayburn. \"Sling is small. YouTube TV and PS Vue are less than a million each. DirecTV Now is down. That's the reality of this business. None of those services can survive on their own because of the cost of standalone.\"\n(Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images) NBCUniversal\nComcast-owned NBCUniversal's streaming service is set to launch in early 2020. There's still much we don't know, but the ad-supported service will reportedly be free for Comcast and Sky cable subscribers, as current on-demand episodes are on network websites with a cable login. NBCUniversal also hopes to ink deals to offer the service free to subscribers of other cable providers such as Charter, DirecTV, and Dish.\nThe company will also offer a paid, ad-free version of the streaming service for non-cable subscribers. That gives NBCU a subscriber pipeline back to traditional cable and a standalone paid subscription offering to compete in the crowded market for a slice of consumers' monthly entertainment budgets.\n\u201cWe think we can get around $5 a month from people who would use a free service,\" said NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke. CBS\nOne media giant that often flies under the radar in the streaming wars is CBS, which owns Showtime and CBS All Access . The latter has spent a modest original-content budget on a few big franchises, headlined by Star Trek: Discovery and additional upcoming Star Trek series; The Good Wife spin-off, The Good Fight ; a reimagining of The Twilight Zone from Jordan Peele (pictured above); and a coming adaptation of Stephen King's The Stand .\nCBS All Access is $5.99 a month with limited commercials or $9.99 a month without ads. Showtime is $10.99 for the standalone service, but you can buy or add the network to existing subscriptions through Prime Video, Amazon Fire TV, Hulu, Roku, Android, or iOS, or through a long list of cable and OTT streaming providers for varying prices. It's also available to existing cable subscribers as Showtime Anytime.\nCBS has been in the digital media and streaming games longer than most, going back to its 2004 deal to buy SportsLine (before CBS and Viacom split up in 2006) and CBS' subsequent acquisition of CNET for $1.8 billion in 2008. CBS has built its own streaming infrastructure atop that stack and now has its business firmly planted in all the big buckets: traditional cable and news, live sports, premium cable with Showtime, and a standalone streaming app in CBS All Access. In its Q4 2018 earnings, CBS reported 8 million streaming subscribers, including 2.5 million for CBS All Access.\nMarc DeBevoise, President and COO of CBS Interactive, spoke to PCMag about the company's choice not to invest in Hulu a decade ago along with Fox, NBC, and ABC/Disney.\n\"Our greatest gift was not doing the Hulu deal. Because we didn't, we saved our powder. That's where All Access was born,\" said DeBevoise. \"We felt we could go out and compete, because we had 160 million users in the US across our web properties and reserved libraries of content with over 100 series. By the time 2014-2015 came around, we were ready, whether the content rights were exclusive or not. Then we had the conversation of putting original content on [All Access] to move the needle.\"\n(Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images) Disney\nTo get a sense of where the broader entertainment and streaming industry is going for the long term, Disney's strategy may be the model to watch most closely. Disney's much-hyped Disney+ streaming service, set to launch in late 2019 , will cost less than Netflix\u2014Jeffrey Cole projects somewhere in the $6-to-$8 range per month\u2014and offer a small number of big-budget originals on top of the vast library of content already in the Disney vault.\nDisney has taken its time making a definitive, calculating, multi-stage entry into the streaming market, going back to 2016, when it invested $1 billion for a 33 percent stake in BAMTech. Formerly part of MLB Advanced Media (MLBAM), at one time the video-streaming company spun out of Major League Baseball powered streaming apps including MLB.TV, HBO Now , the NHL and PGA Tour apps, PlayStation Vue , and even the WWE Network streaming app.\nBAMTech's outside-consulting focus came to a halt when Disney bought another 42 percent stake to take majority control of BAMTech in 2017, and announced its direct-to-consumer streaming services, which would become ESPN+ and Disney+, in the same press release . ESPN+, which costs $4.99 a month or $49.99 per year, hit a million subscribers a few months after its launch.\nDisney's advantages outweigh its challenges as the Mouse enters the SVOD market. Armed with original Marvel and Star Wars series, the Disney and Pixar film vault, Disney Channel kids programming, and the 21st Century Fox catalog, including National Geographic, Disney+ looms large. JPMorgan projects Disney+ will eventually sign up more than 160 million subscribers\u2014compared with Netflix's current 139 million\u2014on the basis of its \"unmatched brand recognition, extensive premium content, and unparalleled ecosystem to market the service.\"\nBig-budget franchises like Marvel and Star Wars are key to Disney's business strategy in all their forms: from Disney book series and toys, to blockbuster films and TV shows, to cruise lines and theme parks such as the massive Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge parks opening in Disneyland and Disney World this summer. Disney's end-to-end pipeline is the most fully realized version of a true content-industrial complex, and the one piece missing until now was a streaming subscription service.\nAs the new players, including Apple, WarnerMedia, and NBCUniversal, have found (or will find out), building a streaming platform from scratch takes time. Rayburn described BAMTech as \"the special forces of our industry. They're the best at what they do, and they've been doing OTT streaming longer than anyone. And by the time Disney+ rolls out, it will still have taken them 18 months to build it.\"\nThe man building it is Joe Inzerillo, the CTO of Disney Streaming Services. Inzerillo is the former CTO of BAMTech and one of the founders of MLBAM. He oversees all Disney's video-streaming tech, including Disney+ and ESPN+ .\nWhile Inzerillo wouldn't comment on any specifics related to the content, original programming, or user interface of Disney+, he hinted to PCMag that Disney is cooking up some fresh storytelling mechanisms to bring its big, interconnected franchises\u2014the Marvel and Star Wars cinematic universes\u2014to viewers in fresh ways.\n\"The thing I find so incredibly compelling about [Marvel and Star Wars] is that it's they're one enormous narrative with a bunch of stories around it,\" said Inzerillo. \"So the user interface of a company's streaming service that makes epic sagas like that needs to be user-connected and one narrative designed to showcase the content for you and put it in front of the fans that love it, not get in the way. But it also needs to be personalized. It needs to be able to do all sorts of things. So it's the fusion of all those components to create this vision of a constant narrative.\" Welcome to the Streaming-Industrial Complex Now you know the players, let's break down the escalating war for original content and the tectonic shifts in an industry that's straddling the media, tech, and entertainment worlds.

Mickey Mouse look on before ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, November 27, 2017 in New York City.\nHere are the biggest calls on Wall Street on Tuesday: Rosenblatt Securities initiated Disney as 'buy'\nRosenblatt is bullish on Disney 's direct-to-consumer strategy.\n\"We initiate coverage on Disney with a Buy rating and a PT of $150, implying 35% upside. DIS offers a compelling risk-reward when contemplating the probability of Disney+ success. DIS' future direct-to-consumer (DTC) success with Disney+ hinges on strong tested DTC IP and a superb track record investing and executing on plan. We expect DTC investments, along with the Fox asset acquisition, will return DIS to a double-digit earnings CAGR in '21E and beyond.\" Seaport Global initiated Lyft as 'sell'\nSeaport is bearish on the idea that millenials and future generations will ditch their cars for ridesharing.\n\"In our view, valuation is the toughest task with LYFT . Most investors are familiar with the brand name and the service. In order to justify its current market valuation, investors need to take a big leap of faith that the millennials and later generations will forego ownership of a car and opt instead for reliance on a ridesharing service. Despite the optics of vehicles being an underutilized asset, we believe people will continue to own their own vehicles as primary transportation and instead rely on the ridesharing services as a convenient supplement. While we believe the ridesharing market will continue to grow and expect LYFT to be a prime competitor, in our view, current valuations reflect an overly optimistic view of consumer behavior in the US. We initiate coverage with a sell rating and $42 price target.\" Deutsche Bank initiated Dow Inc. as 'buy'\nDeutsche Bank said that even though the chemical maker will be smaller than the old Dow, they believe it will be a better investment.\n\"With the separation of Dow from DowDuPont on April 1, THE iconic US chemical company has returned to the public market as an independent company after a brief 19-month hiatus following the merger of Dow and DuPont in '17. While \"New\" Dow is smaller than \"Old\" Dow, having combined its $6B (in sales) Ag business with DuPont's Ag business and shifting $8B of its highest margin specialty sales to DuPont, overall we believe \"New\" Dow will be a better company (and investment) than \"Old\" Dow. With an attractive dividend yield of 5.2%, we initiate coverage with a Buy rating and a price target of $62, with upside potential of 16%.\" Deutsche Bank initiated Intuitive Surgical as 'buy'\nDeutsche Bank said Intuitive Surgical which develops robotic-assisted technologies, tools and services for surgery, has \"best-in-class pro\ufb01tability.\"\n\" Intuitive Surgical is the dominant global leader in robotic surgery and, in our view, one of the premier medtech growth stories: durable premium revenue growth with best-in-class pro\ufb01tability despite the major step-up in investment in 2019 that belies the company's true earnings power. A still-underpenetrated worldwide surgery market leaves substantial runway for continued robust sales growth, with technology innovation \u2013 including two novel new robotic systems now in early commercialization and a steady \ufb02ow of new instruments \u2013 continuing to drive both penetration of established procedure categories and addressable market expansion. While competitor surgical robot launches are likely on the horizon and cannot be overlooked, we think Intuitive's market leadership is sustainable in light of myriad important competitive advantages enumerated herein.\" Jefferies upgraded Lab Corp & Quest Diagnostics to 'buy' from 'hold'\nJefferies said the clinical laboratory companies should benefit from the debut of their preferred lab networks.\n\"We are upgrading DGX & LH given our belief that UNH 's upcoming rollout of its preferred lab network is a positive catalyst for both stocks, as their likely inclusion should bolster organic growth beginning in 2020. With 2019 outlooks (incl. Q1) seemingly de-risked with fairly conservative guidance ranges and 2020 Street estimates looking conservative, DGX's and LH's valuations, at below-historical relative averages make both stocks compelling.\" Deutsche Bank upgraded Hostess Brands to 'buy' from 'hold'\nDeutsche said the maker of Twinkies could return to \"top-tier\" revenue growth this year.\n\"Since our May 2018 downgrade, TWNK has declined ~7% while the XLP has appreciated ~13%. Walmart merchandising issues, Chicago bakery margin/mix headwinds, and general cost inflation have all driven fundamental underperformance relative to peers, as revenue growth decelerated and margin contracted at Hostess. As we said coming out of our management meetings in September, after Q3'18 results in November, ahead of Q4'18 results in February, and after the recent CAGNY lunch in March, the pressures faced in 2018 could easily become tailwinds in 2019, however. If management can execute effectively, all while the Walmart merchandising issue laps, Chicago bakery finally turns profitable, and improved pricing helps to offset freight, commodity, and wage inflation, then we could (and should) have a Hostess this year that returns to top-tier revenue growth in the U.S., all while expanding margins nicely.\" Michael Bloom Senior Talent Producer Related Securities", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bob iger", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rosenblatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "disney", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lyft", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dow inc.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "the walt disney company", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seaport global", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosenblatt securities", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T14:51:49.116+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d2c691baf11fd717bad76c56529a6cc788daefa7", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/02/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-boeing-wells-fargo-lyft-nio-disney-more.html", "site_full": "www.cnbc.com", "site": "cnbc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Stocks making the biggest moves premarket: Boeing, Wells Fargo, Lyft, Nio, Disney & more", "title_full": "Stocks making the biggest moves premarket: Boeing, Wells Fargo, Lyft, Nio, Disney & more", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2019/03/21/105807404-1553199159638gettyimages-1131844056.1910x1000.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 767, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 14, "comments": 4, "shares": 31}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d2c691baf11fd717bad76c56529a6cc788daefa7", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/02/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-boeing-wells-fargo-lyft-nio-disney-more.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Peter Schacknow", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Stocks making the biggest moves premarket: Boeing, Wells Fargo, Lyft, Nio, Disney & more", "text": "6:34 AM ET Tue, 2 April 2019 | 00:46\nCheck out the companies making headlines before the bell:\nWalgreens Boots Alliance \u2014 The drugstore chain operator reported adjusted quarterly profit of $1.64 per share, 8 cents a share below estimates.

Kline, Motley Fool\nWalt Disney (NYSE: DIS) introduced variable pricing at its Florida theme parks last October. Designed to entice consumers to visit during less-crowded times, the pricing plan made tickets more expensive on higher-traffic days.\nNow, the company has once again raised its prices with single-day tickets during the peak Christmas period. The prices are jumping from $124 to $159, according to data from Theme Park Tourist . Other peak periods -- generally, any time kids are out of school aside from summer -- will cost $139 for a one-day, single-park pass.\nPrices for single-day tickets were pushed slightly higher on most days with only the \"value\" tier (August and September) remaining unchanged, at $109 per one-day single-park ticket. Multi-day ticket prices were raised, as well, by 15%-30%, depending on when you go. Adding the \"park hopper\" feature, which lets you visit multiple parks in a single day, has increased by $5.

Participant and mentor recruitment will be managed by UC Davis, the school behind the California Million Women Mentors program.\nThe program certainly makes sense for the New York-based littleBits.

WarnerMedia? The New Streaming Giants Explained", "text": "Disney+? WarnerMedia? The New Streaming Giants Explained Netflix Disney+? WarnerMedia? The New Streaming Giants Explained Everyone knows Netflix, Prime Video, and Hulu. But what about WarnerMedia and Apple TV+? Let's break down the biggest names in video streaming, new and old. Rob Marvin 1 Apr 2019, 2:56 p.m.\nThe video-streaming industry is crowded with big names\u2014some with already-existing services and others with impending apps. Considering the current three largest platforms, the agglomeration of media companies, and the tech companies investing heavily in video, it can be hard to wrap your head around the sheer scope of the entertainment giants that make up this market.\nEach service has its own origin story, business interests, and exclusive originals and licensed content. There's also a wide assortment of fluctuating prices, packages and plans, and technology under the surface .\n\"We're seeing a ton of fragmentation,\" said streaming media consultant and expert Dan Rayburn . \"NBCUniversal is coming out with a service, Disney, WarnerMedia, Viacom bought PlutoTV, Amazon launched IMDb Freedive , and on and on. Netflix, Hulu, Facebook, YouTube, Amazon Prime, HBO...as consumers we're inundated with video everywhere we look.\"\nHere are the most important streaming services to watch in the next hyper-competitive phase of this industry, including interviews with execs from Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, CBS, and Disney, as well as industry analysts and experts. Netflix\nThe modern streaming industry begins and ends with what many have dubbed the \"Netflix Effect\": Regardless of how many Oscars, Emmys, or Golden Globe Awards the one-time DVD delivery service does or doesn't win , Netflix's digital subscription model and its massive investment in originals have set the bar for the market. Netflix reported 58 million US subscribers in September and 139 million subscribers worldwide in Q4.\nThe company generated $1.2 billion in annual net profit on $15.8 billion of revenue in 2018, giving it a current market valuation of around $154 billion, according to Bloomberg. Netflix keeps burning cash and raising debt financing to fund its original-content creation, but for now, the strategy is working. The service adds millions of subscribers around the globe each quarter.\nEven a recent price hike isn't expected to dent Netflix's subscriber base much. Jeffrey Cole, a Research Professor at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, and Director of USC's Center for the Digital Future , believes Netflix could be charging a lot more.\n\"It must drive [Netflix founder and CEO] Reed Hastings crazy that a dozen years ago in the red-envelope days, he gave you five DVDs at a time and unlimited streaming for $16 a month. Now he's giving you not just five theatrical films at a time but dozens or hundreds plus massive amounts of old television shows and $12 billion worth of originals for $9 or $13 or $16 a month,\" said Cole, who has researched the television, media, and streaming industries for almost three decades .\n\"If you paid $16 for five DVDs, you should pay $40 for what you're getting now. But when Netflix broke the company in half, each side priced down at $8. So Netflix is already handicapped by how much it can charge,\" added Cole. \"How much it can spend on originals depends on how fast it grows, and its growth is international. It will hit a wall...the only question is when.\"\nNetflix is ramping up other revenue streams, including a reported expansion of its ad business with more product placement in originals such as Queer Eye . And despite spending more than $1 billion a year on technology, CEO Reed Hastings still positions Netflix as more of a media company akin to Disney than a tech company like Apple or Amazon. Netflix is \"mostly a content company powered by tech,\" he told Recode in response to a question about industry regulation.\nThat posturing is largely semantic; in reality, modern streaming players are all media, entertainment, and tech companies rolled into one. Amazon Prime Video\nUnlike Netflix, Amazon has no discernible caps on how much it can spend, and its business model isn't dependent on video subscribers. Amazon confirmed in 2018 that it has more than 100 million Prime members, and Prime Video's US audience was around 26 million as of last year, Reuters reports .\nPrime Video's core value is to drive more Prime subscriptions at $119 a pop per year, which last year went up from $99 in the first price hike since 2014. So Amazon has no qualms about shelling out billions for original series and films on the indie festival circuit through Amazon Studios. Standalone Prime Video costs $8.99 per month.\nAmazon also owns Prime Video's underlying infrastructure. Streaming high-quality live and on-demand video requires a complicated content-delivery pipeline, from data hosting and storage to encoding and packaging files, all the way down to content delivery networks (CDNs) and playback. Amazon controls the pipes, and Prime Video can enjoy seemingly infinite scale thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nOther streaming platforms need Amazon's cloud, too. Netflix, for instance, spent years and untold millions building out its own global CDN network (the only streaming provider to do so) but relies entirely on AWS for cloud computing and storage.\n\"We package up and have built our technology infrastructure on top of AWS,\" said Girish Bajaj, VP of Software Engineering for Amazon Prime Video. \"Because we serve millions of customers and operate this massive amount of scale, it gives both Prime Video and AWS expertise in how to actually operate these systems, and with that level of scale comes cost savings that we then are able to offer back to customers on the consumer side as well as the enterprise side.\"\n(Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images) Apple\nAmazon has been competing with Netflix for years, but Apple's high-profile entry into the streaming landscape has the potential to further tip the balance of power toward the tech industry.\nLast week, Apple unveiled its Apple TV+ and Apple TV Channels services. TV Channels is coming in May with a major Apple TV software update, and TV+ will be available this fall in over 100 countries. The redesigned Apple TV app is also coming to more form factors, including Roku and Amazon Fire TV devices, and smart TVs from Samsung, Sony, LG, and Vizio.\nThe new Apple TV app will offer original content through the Apple TV+, as well as streaming app and network subscriptions through TV Channels, which is similar to the add-ons offered by Prime Video and Hulu. We don't know what Apple TV+ will cost yet, but Apple confirmed it will be an ad-free subscription service, seemingly disproving reports that Apple TV and iOS users would get access to Apple's original content for free. However, both TV+ and TV Channels will be available to other users in a household via Apple's Family Sharing.\nThrough TV Channels, Apple aims to bring an App Store-like gatekeeper approach to controlling streaming content on iOS devices, and will reportedly take a 30 percent cut on every streaming app subscription through its service. That's a steep commission, but in line with the 30 percent it currently takes on premium app and streaming-service subscriptions through the App Store . The commission drops to 15 percent for subscription renewals.\nTV Channels is launching in May with some big partners, including Amazon Prime Video, HBO, Hulu, Showtime, Starz, CBS All Access , and many others (but not Netflix); Apple showcased Prime Video originals such as The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel in demos during its launch event. TV Channels will also let users choose traditional cable bundles from providers such as Optimum and Spectrum, as well as over-the-top (OTT) cable replacement services including DirecTV Now and PlayStation Vue. Apple's Grand Designs\nThis strategy is part of Apple's broader push into software and services: It has grand designs to expand to several other industries beyond the steadily growing chunk of recurring revenue it currently makes from iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple Pay. Amid stagnating iPhone sales , Apple's glossy launch event for its new slate of services highlights how Apple sees its future growth.\nApple, like Amazon, owns its data centers, so every new service it releases holds tantalizing profit margins. Along with its new streaming offerings, Apple also unveiled its $9.99-per-month Apple News+ service for a bundled subscription to 300 magazines and newspapers, its Apple Arcade games subscription service, and the Goldman Sachs-backed Apple Card .\nFor all of these services\u2014particularly where it's aggregating content under its own banner\u2014Apple will take a hefty cut. The Wall Street Journal reported that the tech giant is demanding 50 percent from news publishers for Apple News+, which is built on Apple's acquisition of Texture , described as a \"Netflix for magazines.\"\nAs for original content, Apple's shows will reportedly be family-friendly ; no sex, violence, or profanity from Cupertino. When adding yet another online content platform to the digital media pile, banning R-rated content of any kind is certainly one way for Apple to differentiate its originals. That, and signing Oprah to make documentaries and bring back her book club as Apple exclusives.\n\u201cI think entertainment's going to become a key element of Apple's business,\u201d said USC's Jeffrey Cole. \u201cFor them, spending $2 billion on [original content] is just dabbling. If they like what they see, I think they'll have a $10 billion budget.\u201d Hulu\nThe third established veteran in the market, Hulu is a particularly intriguing player given its new mouse-shaped overlord. Hulu now has 25 million subscribers across its ad-supported, ad-free, and Hulu + Live TV services; it declined to break down that number into specific subscriber totals in an interview with PCMag.\nWith Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox, the entertainment powerhouse also picked up Fox's 30 percent stake in Hulu, giving it a majority 60 percent (it already owned 30 percent). Variety reports that Disney is in negotiations with AT&T to pick up an additional 10 percent stake, leaving Comcast/NBCUniversal's remaining 30 percent as the only outside ownership stake in a streaming platform that has long represented the network TV industry's collective streaming interests. Not anymore.\n\"Hulu really benefited, I think, by being owned by a handful of studios. Now it's basically a division of Disney,\" said USC's Cole.\nBut Cole doesn't believe Comcast will relinquish its Hulu stake for less than a kingly price. He cited Comcast's ultimately failed $65 million bid to steal 21st Century Fox away from Disney and the open secret of bad blood between Comcast CEO Brian Roberts and Disney chief Bob Iger.\nBeatrice Springborn, Vice President of Content Development at Hulu, said the service doesn't measure success by nightly ratings or individual show performance. It's about getting new subscribers to sign up for Hulu, watch a lot of content on the platform, and remain subscribers for the long haul.\nAs for how Disney's streaming plans will affect Hulu, Springborn said the company is staying the course until directed otherwise.\n\"It is impossible to predict the future, but we do know that Hulu is a major strategic asset for all of our owners. Hulu added 8 million subscribers last year, and that kind of growth is only possible when you have owners that support you and are aligned with your strategy,\" said Springborn. \"There is a lot of noise and speculation about transactions right now, but our teams are staying laser-focused on making Hulu the number-one choice for TV.\"\nFollowing Netflix's price increase, Hulu took the opposite route and cut the price of its entry-level ad-supported plan from $7.99 to $5.99 per month. But it did raise the price of its Hulu + Live TV plan package from $39.99 to $44.99 per month. WarnerMedia\nWarnerMedia is the most recent example of high-profile corporate consolidation fueling the next wave of streaming services. The newly formed pool of media brands and TV channels centralizes AT&T's Time Warner assets under one streaming roof .\nAT&T's major corporate restructuring of WarnerMedia was enacted shortly after the long-awaited regulatory approval of its merger with HBO and Turner parent company Time Warner. (HBO and Turner initially agreed to participate in this story but dropped out shortly before their scheduled interviews, in the wake of the sudden resignations of longtime HBO chief Richard Plepler and Turner head David Levy.)\nThe major changes approved by AT&T exec John Stankey (pictured above) include installing former NBC and Showtime head Bob Greenblatt as the new chairman of WarnerMedia Entertainment, the division handling WarnerMedia's TV assets and direct-to-consumer operations. He will oversee the group's crown jewel\u2014its forthcoming streaming platform combining all the content from HBO, TNT, TBS, TruTV, CNN, the CW, Warner Bros. and DC Comics films, Cartoon Network, and more under a single app.\nHBO will still be offered as a standalone service , but all of the premium cable network's original series, movies, documentaries, and so on will also be incorporated into the as-yet-unnamed WarnerMedia streaming service, which is targeted to launch in Q4 2019. We don't know pricing details, but Stankey said it'll be more expensive than HBO Now's current $14.99-per-month cost, which will put AT&T's service at the high end of the price continuum. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said on an earnings call that the new service will have a \"two-sided business model\" with both a premium tier offering commercial-free programming and a more affordable ad-supported tier akin to Hulu.\nAT&T's first foray into OTT streaming, DirecTV Now , hasn't enjoyed long-term success. It went with the cable-replication model of bundling channels together into various digital packages, similar to other Virtual Multichannel Programming Distributors (vMVPDs) such as Hulu + Live TV, Sling, PlayStation Vue, FuboTV, and YouTube TV. But as competition has increased, DirecTV Now subscribers have been fleeing in droves . The service lost 267,000 subscribers in Q4 of 2018 alone, and it has raised prices twice in the past year: a $5 increase last July and another $10 hike in March.\nThe telecommunications giant's move to buy Time Warner exemplifies a corporate-level shift across the industry away from that costly standalone model and into Subscription Video On-Demand (SVOD) with its WarnerMedia streaming service.\n\"We've been talking about cord-cutting for years and the death of cable for a decade, but how many subscribers do these services have?\" said Dan Rayburn. \"Sling is small. YouTube TV and PS Vue are less than a million each. DirecTV Now is down. That's the reality of this business. None of those services can survive on their own because of the cost of standalone.\"\n(Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images) NBCUniversal\nComcast-owned NBCUniversal's streaming service is set to launch in early 2020. There's still much we don't know, but the ad-supported service will reportedly be free for Comcast and Sky cable subscribers, as current on-demand episodes are on network websites with a cable login. NBCUniversal also hopes to ink deals to offer the service free to subscribers of other cable providers such as Charter, DirecTV, and Dish.\nThe company will also offer a paid, ad-free version of the streaming service for non-cable subscribers. That gives NBCU a subscriber pipeline back to traditional cable and a standalone paid subscription offering to compete in the crowded market for a slice of consumers' monthly entertainment budgets.\n\u201cWe think we can get around $5 a month from people who would use a free service,\" said NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke. CBS\nOne media giant that often flies under the radar in the streaming wars is CBS, which owns Showtime and CBS All Access . The latter has spent a modest original-content budget on a few big franchises, headlined by Star Trek: Discovery and additional upcoming Star Trek series; The Good Wife spin-off, The Good Fight ; a reimagining of The Twilight Zone from Jordan Peele (pictured above); and a coming adaptation of Stephen King's The Stand .\nCBS All Access is $5.99 a month with limited commercials or $9.99 a month without ads. Showtime is $10.99 for the standalone service, but you can buy or add the network to existing subscriptions through Prime Video, Amazon Fire TV, Hulu, Roku, Android, or iOS, or through a long list of cable and OTT streaming providers for varying prices. It's also available to existing cable subscribers as Showtime Anytime.\nCBS has been in the digital media and streaming games longer than most, going back to its 2004 deal to buy SportsLine (before CBS and Viacom split up in 2006) and CBS' subsequent acquisition of CNET for $1.8 billion in 2008. CBS has built its own streaming infrastructure atop that stack and now has its business firmly planted in all the big buckets: traditional cable and news, live sports, premium cable with Showtime, and a standalone streaming app in CBS All Access. In its Q4 2018 earnings, CBS reported 8 million streaming subscribers, including 2.5 million for CBS All Access.\nMarc DeBevoise, President and COO of CBS Interactive, spoke to PCMag about the company's choice not to invest in Hulu a decade ago along with Fox, NBC, and ABC/Disney.\n\"Our greatest gift was not doing the Hulu deal. Because we didn't, we saved our powder. That's where All Access was born,\" said DeBevoise. \"We felt we could go out and compete, because we had 160 million users in the US across our web properties and reserved libraries of content with over 100 series. By the time 2014-2015 came around, we were ready, whether the content rights were exclusive or not. Then we had the conversation of putting original content on [All Access] to move the needle.\"\n(Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images) Disney\nTo get a sense of where the broader entertainment and streaming industry is going for the long term, Disney's strategy may be the model to watch most closely. Disney's much-hyped Disney+ streaming service, set to launch in late 2019 , will cost less than Netflix\u2014Jeffrey Cole projects somewhere in the $6-to-$8 range per month\u2014and offer a small number of big-budget originals on top of the vast library of content already in the Disney vault.\nDisney has taken its time making a definitive, calculating, multi-stage entry into the streaming market, going back to 2016, when it invested $1 billion for a 33 percent stake in BAMTech. Formerly part of MLB Advanced Media (MLBAM), at one time the video-streaming company spun out of Major League Baseball powered streaming apps including MLB.TV, HBO Now , the NHL and PGA Tour apps, PlayStation Vue , and even the WWE Network streaming app.\nBAMTech's outside-consulting focus came to a halt when Disney bought another 42 percent stake to take majority control of BAMTech in 2017, and announced its direct-to-consumer streaming services, which would become ESPN+ and Disney+, in the same press release . ESPN+, which costs $4.99 a month or $49.99 per year, hit a million subscribers a few months after its launch.\nDisney's advantages outweigh its challenges as the Mouse enters the SVOD market. Armed with original Marvel and Star Wars series, the Disney and Pixar film vault, Disney Channel kids programming, and the 21st Century Fox catalog, including National Geographic, Disney+ looms large. JPMorgan projects Disney+ will eventually sign up more than 160 million subscribers\u2014compared with Netflix's current 139 million\u2014on the basis of its \"unmatched brand recognition, extensive premium content, and unparalleled ecosystem to market the service.\"\nBig-budget franchises like Marvel and Star Wars are key to Disney's business strategy in all their forms: from Disney book series and toys, to blockbuster films and TV shows, to cruise lines and theme parks such as the massive Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge parks opening in Disneyland and Disney World this summer. Disney's end-to-end pipeline is the most fully realized version of a true content-industrial complex, and the one piece missing until now was a streaming subscription service.\nAs the new players, including Apple, WarnerMedia, and NBCUniversal, have found (or will find out), building a streaming platform from scratch takes time. Rayburn described BAMTech as \"the special forces of our industry. They're the best at what they do, and they've been doing OTT streaming longer than anyone. And by the time Disney+ rolls out, it will still have taken them 18 months to build it.\"\nThe man building it is Joe Inzerillo, the CTO of Disney Streaming Services. Inzerillo is the former CTO of BAMTech and one of the founders of MLBAM. He oversees all Disney's video-streaming tech, including Disney+ and ESPN+ .\nWhile Inzerillo wouldn't comment on any specifics related to the content, original programming, or user interface of Disney+, he hinted to PCMag that Disney is cooking up some fresh storytelling mechanisms to bring its big, interconnected franchises\u2014the Marvel and Star Wars cinematic universes\u2014to viewers in fresh ways.\n\"The thing I find so incredibly compelling about [Marvel and Star Wars] is that it's they're one enormous narrative with a bunch of stories around it,\" said Inzerillo. \"So the user interface of a company's streaming service that makes epic sagas like that needs to be user-connected and one narrative designed to showcase the content for you and put it in front of the fans that love it, not get in the way. But it also needs to be personalized. It needs to be able to do all sorts of things. So it's the fusion of all those components to create this vision of a constant narrative.\" Welcome to the Streaming-Industrial Complex Now you know the players, let's break down the escalating war for original content and the tectonic shifts in an industry that's straddling the media, tech, and entertainment worlds. Then jump into the tech powering it all .

In a blog post Tuesday, he said customers can tweak their orders at home or from their smartphone while on the go.\nThe voice-shopping service comes out of a partnership between the two companies that began in August 2017, one of several alliances Walmart has made in recent years with technology companies including Microsoft Corp., China\u2019s JD.com and Japan\u2019s Rakuten. But the Walmart-Google pairing hasn\u2019t had much to talk about since then, especially after Walmart withdrew from Google\u2019s shopping platform earlier this year.\nFor Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, teaming with the world\u2019s largest retailer could help its digital home assistant bridge the gap with Amazon\u2019s Echo device, commonly known as Alexa. It won\u2019t be easy: Amazon controlled 70 percent of the 66 million smart speaker devices installed in the U.S. as of December, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Google Home had just 24 percent.\nBoth Amazon and Google also face the challenge of convincing consumers to order by voice, which is tricky for perishable items like fresh salmon. Only 4 percent of shoppers use voice assistants for grocery planning, according to research from consultant Bain & Co., a fraction of those who own smart speakers. And those who are interested in voice-based grocery shopping already have other options: Rival Kroger Co. has unveiled voice-shopping capabilities through Google.\nGoogle\u2019s home assistant is available on devices including iPhones and JBL portable speakers, Walmart said.

The new products give Amazon a greater reach than ever before. Updates to the internet giant's Alexa-infused Echo smart speakers will allow them to tend to microwave cooking and even have \"hunches\" regarding what users may want or have forgotten. Alexa is even developing a personality, complete with a favorite pet or beer. Here's a round up all of the Alexa-infused products Amazon showcased, including speakers, an in-car device and, a microwave: Echo Dot 21 Sep, 2018 The revamped Echo Dot has a new look, with rounded edges, and packs more punch, with a 1.6-inch driver delivering 70-per cent-louder audio than the previous model. The speaker has lower distortion and enhanced bass. It can connect to other speakers and other apps and devices over Bluetooth. Echo Sub 21 Sep, 2018 If you're craving more low-end tones from your Echo setup, you might consider the Echo Sub. It delivers down-firing, 100W of bass through its 6-inch woofer, and you can pair it with an Echo or two to create a 2.1 stereo system. Echo Plus 21 Sep, 2018 Amazon updated its Echo Plus, which includes a smart hub for a range of connected devices. This time around, it has revamped speakers and a feature called local voice control, which lets you adjust your various smart-home devices even if your internet connection is down. There's a temperature sensor too, so Echo Plus can tell smart thermostats to turn up the heat when it gets a little chilly. Echo Input 21 Sep, 2018 Not to be outdone by Chromecast Audio, Amazon has its own audio dongle called Echo Input, including Bluetooth, a microphone and a 3.5mm jack. It doesn't have a speaker, so you'll need to connect it to your existing audio setup. Next Google\u2019s home assistant is available on devices including iPhones and JBL portable speakers, Walmart said. The retailer will also expand the service to other platforms in the coming months, it said, a signal that it may be working with Apple Inc.

Walmart is the biggest grocery chain in the country,\" Cramer said on \" Squawk on the Street .\" \"Amazon will stop at nothing to take away the share that Walmart has gained.\"\nCramer's charitable trust owns shares of Amazon. Amazon did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Cramer's remarks.\nAmazon said it will slash prices on hundreds of items at Whole Foods stores starting Wednesday as the company extends its focus beyond enticing Prime shoppers. Amazon acquired Whole Foods, known for its organic selection and high prices, in 2017.

The company is rolling out a new voice-ordering capability, Walmart Voice Order, which works across Google Assistant-powered platforms, including Google\u2019s smart speakers and displays, smartphones, smartwatches and more.\nThe news follows several efforts by Walmart to enter voice-based commerce, despite not offering its own hardware or voice assistant platform, as Amazon does with Echo and Alexa, respectively.\nTwo years ago, Walmart and Google partnered on voice-based shopping through Google Home devices. Specifically, customers could easily reorder favorites through Google\u2019s shopping service, Google Express. However, Walmart disappeared from Google Express\u2019 marketplace this January, and was more recently said to be testing an online grocery voice application with a small number of VIP customers ahead of a spring launch.\nThe technology works similarly to what was developed for the Walmart-Google Express deal. For example, when a customer asks to order an item, the assistant will know to reorder the customer\u2019s preferred item based on their order history. The assistant will also inform the customer which item it\u2019s choosing and the price point.\nThis feature means the customer doesn\u2019t have to speak the full name of an item when making a request. Instead, they could say just \u201cmilk\u201d and the assistant would know they mean the \u201c1 gallon of 1% Great Value organic milk\u201d they ordered the last time.\nTo get started, Google Assistant users launch the feature as they would any other voice application. They\u2019ll say: \u201cOK Google, talk to Walmart.\u201d\nThat\u2019s still not as simple as Amazon\u2019s assistant, though. Because of its first-party platform advantage, you can say, \u201cAlexa, order milk\u201d to order from Whole Foods, or \u201cAlexa, add milk to my shopping list\u201d for future orders or general list-making.\nWalmart\u2019s voice app is meant to be used to round-up items for a later purchase by adding them to a cart, instead of forcing a checkout upon each new addition. This lets you add an item as you realize you\u2019re out \u2014 something that better reflects how customers use voice to shop.\n\u201cWe know when using voice technology, customers like to add items to their cart one at a time over a few days \u2014 not complete their shopping for the week all at once,\u201d noted Walmart\u2019s SVP of Digital Operations, Tom Ward.\nCustomers\u2019 tendency to shop in bits and pieces was one of the big oversights in the 2018 report that claimed voice shopping was a dud. It didn\u2019t incorporate into its findings one of the most popular voice features \u2014 list-making \u2014 and instead only considered voice shopping had occurred when orders were placed immediately. In reality, lists are a big driver of later e-commerce purchases but aren\u2019t as easily tracked.\nWalmart says the new voice-shopping feature will launch to all Google Assistant-powered devices this month, including Google Home, Android and iPhones, smartwatches and other platforms, including those from third parties like JBL or Lenovo, among others. The rollout will be staged, meaning over the next few weeks more and more customers will get the update.\nVoice shopping for grocery pickup will be offered at more than 2,100 Walmart stores and for online delivery at more than 800 stores.\nThe retailer says other platforms besides Google will be added in time, but that isn\u2019t likely to include Alexa, which today holds a 60+ percent market share on smart speakers, according to eMarketer.\nHowever, grocery shopping is a sizable business for Walmart, accounting for more than half its annual sales. Newer technology initiatives, like online grocery, have been successful with its customers, as well.\nAccording to a recent report from financial services firm Cowen and Company, Walmart\u2019s curbside pickup could generate $30 billion to $35 billion for the grocery industry annually by 2020 and that today, 11 to 13 percent of its customers use the pickup service.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sarah perez", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alexa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "walmart", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "walmart voice order", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google express", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google home", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T17:26:13.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b038e3cd34a1bc77554ce6f1211abc1e0bd24ec8", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/dowdupont-dow-jones-industrial-average-adds-dow-after-spin-off-2019-4", "site_full": "www.businessinsider.com", "site": "businessinsider.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "DowDuPont: Dow Jones Industrial Average adds Dow after spin off - Business Insider", "title_full": "DowDuPont: Dow Jones Industrial Average adds Dow after spin off - Business Insider", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5ca37980569b551dde4f2019-2732-1366.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 283, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b038e3cd34a1bc77554ce6f1211abc1e0bd24ec8", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/dowdupont-dow-jones-industrial-average-adds-dow-after-spin-off-2019-4", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Arjun Reddy", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "DowDuPont: Dow Jones Industrial Average adds Dow after spin off - Business Insider", "text": "Dow began trading on the Down Jones Industrial Average on Tuesday after being spun off from parent DowDuPont.

The service also allows you to populate a cart over several days before placing the order rather than having to remember to add everything all in one go.\nWalmart Voice Order is set to slowly roll out to more customers \"over the next few weeks,\" so if you don't have access to it yet you will soon. Walmart also suggests that Google is just the start and that other smart assistants will be gaining access to Voice Order in the future.

It is gunning for more dollars in high-margin categories such as home goods with a growing catalog of private-label items. It\u2019s offering two-hour delivery in some markets, a speedy service few retailers are in position to match. And its popular, voice-activated Alexa devices and software have put it at the center of the emerging trend of shopping via virtual assistants. There is one important area, though, where Amazon\u2019s strategy looks much fuzzier: Click-and-collect. This hybrid of online and physical shopping is proving popular, and it could potentially prove a costly mistake for Amazon that it hasn\u2019t moved more quickly to get a piece of the action. A new report from Cowen & Co. estimates that curbside grocery pickup will account for $35 billion in sales in the U.S. by 2020 as it is embraced by a greater proportion of consumers. This is a model that\u2019s well-suited for traditional retailers. They are in a good position to scale up quickly, and they are doing just that. Target Corp.\u2019s Drive Up service is offered at about 1,000 stores and will be in all stores by the end of 2019. Walmart Inc.\u2019s grocery pickup program is available at about 2,100 stores and will be in 3,100 stores by the end of the fiscal year.(1) Both Walmart and Target say their net promoter scores \u2013 a key measure of customer satisfaction \u2013 are especially high for curbside services. And the click-and collect push is making a difference. Cowen analysts estimate that Walmart grocery pickup is contributing significantly to the retailer\u2019s overall U.S. comparable sales growth. They forecast Walmart\u2019s U.S. comparable sales will increase 2.8 percent for the current fiscal year from the prior year, and that grocery pickup will account for between 0.9 and 1.3 percentage points. It\u2019s not that Amazon is sitting idly by when it comes to this digital-physical shopping mashup. It has two locations of AmazonFresh Pickup in Seattle, a drive-up spot for retrieving groceries. Its Whole Foods Market chain has rolled out click-and-collect services in 22 cities. And beyond the grocery segment, Amazon has a limited number of pickup centers and lockers. It all adds up to a smattering of tentative moves \u2013 not a cohesive strategy that can ramp up quickly nationwide. On some level, it makes sense that Amazon isn\u2019t a leader in click-and-collect. It will be harder for it to make such an operation profitable when it is building its stable of pickup points from scratch (or via acquisition, in the case of Whole Foods.) And I suppose Amazon could convince itself click-and-collect isn\u2019t an end game for e-commerce, but merely a bridge format that offers some measure of convenience before technology such as driverless cars, drones and smart-home entry systems make doorstep delivery \u2013 which Amazon dominates \u2013 more economical for sellers and more appealing for shoppers. But there are downsides for Amazon in not more aggressively pursuing click-and-collect sales. For one, even if click-and-collect fades as a format at some point, it is serving as an entry point to the wider digital ecosystems of the likes of Walmart, Target and Kroger Co., cultivating digital loyalty to those brands. It might prove hard for Amazon to elbow its way into a given customer\u2019s online routine once that relationship has been established. And there\u2019s a rather strong possibility that pickup is here to stay. It has particular appeal in suburbs, where shoppers spend a good chunk of their day in cars. Pickup, unlike same-day delivery, typically doesn\u2019t come with a fee, which may hold ongoing sway for budget-conscious consumers. Amazon obviously sees value in becoming a so-called multi-channel retailer, given its acquisition of Whole Foods and its reported plans of creating yet another grocery chain. But the window is closing for Amazon to develop a serious click-and-collect strategy that can compete with the maturing ones its competitors have already built. It should be moving faster to make this service more widely available via Whole Foods. Or perhaps it could even establish some outside-the-box way of adding pickup points quickly. Think, for example, of its pilot partnership with Kohl\u2019s Corp., in which customers can make returns of Amazon purchases at the department store. Amazon is such a formidable retailing force, maybe being an also-ran at click-and-collect won\u2019t be so terrible for it. But the e-commerce heavyweight will be better off if it gets more skin in the game. (1) Both retailers have additional click-and-collect programs that allow customers to pick up online orders at a counter in the store.

Save Nicole Lee\nWalmart customers once again will be able to voice-order their groceries with Google Assistant, another bid by the brick-and-mortar store to compete with Amazon. The retailer announced the partnership on Tuesday, and said it would gradually roll out the feature in the next few weeks. The development comes after Walmart unceremoniously left Google Express, Google's online shopping tool, back in January, reportedly to develop its own Google Assistant shopping feature.\nWalmart shoppers will soon be able to add items to their shopping carts by saying \"Hey Google, talk to Walmart.\" The feature will be cross-platform, meaning customers can shop from any device that has the Google Assistant feature, ranging from smart speakers and displays to their Android watch or iPhone. Google Home will keep track of your preferred brands at Walmart, saving shoppers some time. While Walmart offered same-day and next-day shipping with Google Express, it's unclear what shipping options Walmart will offer with the new venture.\nWalmart, which still maintains its status as the world's largest retailer in 2019, has aimed to claim some of the e-commerce territory already in Amazon and Alexa 's firm grip. Amazon has struggled to maintain its lead in online grocery ordering as companies like Walmart, Peapod and Instacart have stepped up their game. While 74 percent of consumers named Amazon as their primary destination for online shopping in 2017, that share dropped to 38 percent in 2018, according to data from the Institute of Grocery Distribution . Walmart expanded its online grocery delivery to 100 different cities in 2018, just as Whole Foods and Amazon partnered to offer 2-hour delivery in select cities. Sam's Club, a division of Walmart, partnered with Instacart earlier this month to bring same-day delivery to select markets.\nShopping on Amazon coupled with the convenience of a voice assistant like Alexa is a unique perk that, up until this point, the big box retailers couldn't replicate. Still, Walmart and Google have a lot of ground to tread if it wants to compete with Alexa. Amazon controls 70 percent of the smart speakers installed as of December 2018, compared to Google's 24 percent, according to Consumer Intelligence Partners . But with the new Google and Walmart partnership, customers who prefer the Walmart brand over Amazon's grocery offerings may choose to spring for a Google Home assistant.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "google assistant walmart", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "walmart", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "save nicole lee walmart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google express", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google home", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T20:03:08.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7a76fbdc05f7820e145bdf220e532ff7779c8e36", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/news/walmart-will-let-you-shop-for-groceries-using-google-assistant/", "site_full": "www.cnet.com", "site": "cnet.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["shopping", "media", "cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Walmart will let you shop for groceries using Google Assistant - CNET", "title_full": "Walmart will let you shop for groceries using Google Assistant - CNET", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.065, "main_image": "https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/PYZ6ZA9u3VRlkG092CrFr7s_DS4=/756x567/2019/04/02/3063b9b9-da5c-459c-8beb-1f9ddd69fad2/walmart.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 164, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7a76fbdc05f7820e145bdf220e532ff7779c8e36", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/news/walmart-will-let-you-shop-for-groceries-using-google-assistant/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Marrian Zhou", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Walmart will let you shop for groceries using Google Assistant - CNET", "text": "Walmart Voice Order lets users shop for groceries using voice commands.\nWalmart You'll soon be able to shop for vegetables at Walmart using voice commands.

It is gunning for more dollars in high-margin categories such as home goods with a growing catalog of private-label items. It\u2019s offering two-hour delivery in some markets, a speedy service few retailers are in position to match. And its popular, voice-activated Alexa devices and software have put it at the center of the emerging trend of shopping via virtual assistants. There is one important area, though, where Amazon\u2019s strategy looks much fuzzier: Click-and-collect. This hybrid of online and physical shopping is proving popular, and it could potentially prove a costly mistake for Amazon that it hasn\u2019t moved more quickly to get a piece of the action.\nA new report from Cowen & Co. estimates that curbside grocery pickup will account for $35 billion in sales in the U.S. by 2020 as it is embraced by a greater proportion of consumers.\nThis is a model that\u2019s well-suited for traditional retailers. They are in a good position to scale up quickly, and they are doing just that. Target Corp.\u2019s Drive Up service is offered at about 1,000 stores and will be in all stores by the end of 2019. Walmart Inc.\u2019s grocery pickup program is available at about 2,100 stores and will be in 3,100 stores by the end of the fiscal year.(1)\nBoth Walmart and Target say their net promoter scores \u2013 a key measure of customer satisfaction \u2013 are especially high for curbside services. And the click-and collect push is making a difference. Cowen analysts estimate that Walmart grocery pickup is contributing significantly to the retailer\u2019s overall U.S. comparable sales growth. They forecast Walmart\u2019s U.S. comparable sales will increase 2.8 percent for the current fiscal year from the prior year, and that grocery pickup will account for between 0.9 and 1.3 percentage points.\nIt\u2019s not that Amazon is sitting idly by when it comes to this digital-physical shopping mashup. It has two locations of AmazonFresh Pickup in Seattle, a drive-up spot for retrieving groceries. Its Whole Foods Market chain has rolled out click-and-collect services in 22 cities. And beyond the grocery segment, Amazon has a limited number of pickup centers and lockers. It all adds up to a smattering of tentative moves \u2013 not a cohesive strategy that can ramp up quickly nationwide.\nOn some level, it makes sense that Amazon isn\u2019t a leader in click-and-collect. It will be harder for it to make such an operation profitable when it is building its stable of pickup points from scratch (or via acquisition, in the case of Whole Foods.) And I suppose Amazon could convince itself click-and-collect isn\u2019t an end game for e-commerce, but merely a bridge format that offers some measure of convenience before technology such as driverless cars, drones and smart-home entry systems make doorstep delivery \u2013 which Amazon dominates \u2013 more economical for sellers and more appealing for shoppers.\nBut there are downsides for Amazon in not more aggressively pursuing click-and-collect sales.\nFor one, even if click-and-collect fades as a format at some point, it is serving as an entry point to the wider digital ecosystems of the likes of Walmart, Target and Kroger Co., cultivating digital loyalty to those brands. It might prove hard for Amazon to elbow its way into a given customer\u2019s online routine once that relationship has been established.\nAnd there\u2019s a rather strong possibility that pickup is here to stay. It has particular appeal in suburbs, where shoppers spend a good chunk of their day in cars. Pickup, unlike same-day delivery, typically doesn\u2019t come with a fee, which may hold ongoing sway for budget-conscious consumers.\nAmazon obviously sees value in becoming a so-called multi-channel retailer, given its acquisition of Whole Foods and its reported plans of creating yet another grocery chain. But the window is closing for Amazon to develop a serious click-and-collect strategy that can compete with the maturing ones its competitors have already built. It should be moving faster to make this service more widely available via Whole Foods. Or perhaps it could even establish some outside-the-box way of adding pickup points quickly. Think, for example, of its pilot partnership with Kohl\u2019s Corp., in which customers can make returns of Amazon purchases at the department store.\nAmazon is such a formidable retailing force, maybe being an also-ran at click-and-collect won\u2019t be so terrible for it. But the e-commerce heavyweight will be better off if it gets more skin in the game.\n(1) Both retailers have additional click-and-collect programs that allow customers to pick up online orders at a counter in the store.\nTo contact the author of this story: Sarah Halzack at shalzack@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.net\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\nSarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

Curbside fulfillment for online orders is increasingly popular, and Amazon is hard-pressed to compete. Its main consumer-facing physical presence are its Whole Foods Market locations, which account for nearly all of Amazon's 520 physical stores in North America. By comparison, Walmart has over 2,000 stores offering curbside pickup and will spin up 1,000 more by the end of the fiscal year.\nA report by Cowen & Company estimates curbside fulfillment could generate between $30 billion and $35 billion next year. And while Amazon is working to compete, it's playing from behind -- and catching up will be extremely expensive.\nImage source: Walmart.\nGrocery shopping made easy The growth of curbside pickup at stores like Walmart and Target is a result of the fact that it combines the convenience of online shopping and the speed of physical retail. Customers don't even have to get out of their cars and go into the stores.\nWhile curbside pickup is still used by only a small percentage of shoppers, that number is growing. Cowen estimates 11% to 13% of Walmart shoppers use grocery pickup, and 14% of all shoppers used grocery pickup in 2018. The analysts expect the number of shoppers who have tried grocery pickup to climb to 25% by next year as the feature expands to more stores and retailers add more products available for curbside fulfillment.\nWalmart is adding 1,000 new stores to its 2,100 grocery pickup locations this year. Target's Drive Up service will be available at all of its 1,845 stores by the end of the year.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is lagging behind. It offers Prime Now on a few items in a few cities. Prime Members can order groceries from Whole Foods for pickup, but that's available in only 22 cities. Amazon simply doesn't have the physical presence to compete with Walmart or Target.\nShould Amazon invest in grocery pickup? Amazon's ability to compete in curbside fulfillment requires additional \"curbs.\" The company is expanding Whole Foods locations, and it's testing a new grocery brand . It can design the new stores with curbside fulfillment in mind, which could give it a significant advantage in the future. Walmart and Target are forced to build systems around their existing store and parking lot layouts.\nBut building and operating thousands of grocery stores is expensive, and the profits aren't particularly attractive. Supermarket profit margins float between 1% and 2%. Whole Foods, which specializes in organic food, had a profit margin of just 2.4% in the 40 weeks prior to its acquisition by Amazon. Not to mention that the cash outlay for buying, leasing, and developing real estate would be massive to reach a scale similar to Walmart or Target in short order.\nAmazon has never let costs stop it from seizing an opportunity if it's attractive enough. And the $35 billion opportunity in curbside pickup is more than 10% of Amazon's total retail sales last year.\nBut the opportunity goes beyond curbside fulfillment. Walmart and Target are attracting new customers to their digital properties. Cowen estimates 40% to 60% of Walmart's curbside orders come from new customers. That could lead customers to use the brick-and-mortar retailers for more online orders instead of Amazon, making curbside pickup a bigger threat to Amazon than just missing out on that $35 billion opportunity.\nAmazon needs to start experimenting with establishing and promoting curbside fulfillment in more markets to determine whether it's feasible. If it doesn't work out, Amazon will lose some money. But if it can establish a significant physical presence, the long-term potential could be very meaningful for the company.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-01/amazon-risks-missing-out-on-35-billion-click-and-collect-market?srnd=opinion"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "walmart", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cowen & company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T06:06:04.040+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "32e3b73c68843210a7a0c487e3e75547830d409b", "url": "https://za.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-shares-mixed-at-close-of-trade-dow-jones-industrial-average-down-030-1441485", "site_full": "za.investing.com", "site": "investing.com", "site_section": "https://za.investing.com/news/stock-market-news", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Stock Market News - Investing.com ZA", "title": "U.S. shares mixed at close of trade; Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.30% By Investing.com", "title_full": "U.S. shares mixed at close of trade; Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.30% By Investing.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB110XX_L.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 699, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "32e3b73c68843210a7a0c487e3e75547830d409b", "url": "https://za.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-shares-mixed-at-close-of-trade-dow-jones-industrial-average-down-030-1441485", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Investing.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "U.S. shares mixed at close of trade; Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.30% By Investing.com", "text": "\u00a9 Reuters.

This fantasy adventure film, with all the trappings of a typical Disney fare, is the story of a baby elephant, who uses his extra-large ears to fly.\nSet in 1920s, in the exploitative, bullying world of the early circuses, Dumbo is born in captivity, in a circus belonging to Max Medici (Danny DeVito).\nThe circus business is not doing too-well. With failing audience, Max is always in a crabby mood. Meanwhile, Colt (Colin Farrell) his once star equestrian, now returned from World War I with an amputated arm, is trying to re-adjust himself in the circus.\nMax puts Colt in charge of his star elephant, Jumbo, who is now pregnant and about to give birth.\nAfter the birth of the calf, Max is disappointed as the baby elephant seems to be a misfit. With large ears and slow on the uptake, the calf appears `Dumb`. Inadvertently with an accidental jumble of characters, it is termed `Dumbo`.\nWith his circus business failing, Max splits up the pachyderm mother and son, in order to balance his costs.\nWhile Colt is assigned to watch over the elephants, his estranged children Milly and Joe are much more thrilled than he is about it. It is no surprise that the children develop a more meaningful bond with Dumbo, after they realise that he can fly. How they reunite the baby elephant with its mother, forms the crux of the narrative.\nWhile the story is based on the original novel by Helen Aberson and Harold Pearl, the screenplay of the is film by Ehren Kruger has all the trappings of modern Disney films; A hero who is nearly an orphan, a villain who schemes against him, two little characters who do a double act, trusted sidekicks and advisers and a sexy dame who lands up in the hero`s arms almost effortlessly.\nIn this case, we have Eva Green as the French, trapeze artist Colette, who tries to bond and learns to fly Dumbo. It is interesting to see her cross Vandevere (Michael Keaton), the owner of Dreamland where Dumbo and the rest of the Medici troupe are held hostage.\nDumbo himself is brought to life with obsessive detailed CGI that goes a long way into making his every action and facial expression adorable. His large pooled eyes and flapping fan-like-ears make him very adorable.\nBeing a Disney film, we know nothing bad is going to happen to him, but it`s still easy to become nervous whenever he is placed in perilous situations because of some ignorant people who insist on making his life miserable.\nOverall, while adults will find this film tolerable, the kids are sure to lap it up with full gusto.

However, optimism remains in the street surrounding trade talks and the potential for a stronger Chinese economy.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 79.29 points, or 0.3%, to 26,179.13 as a weak earnings report from Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc defined the index. The S&P 500 index added0.05 point to 2,867.24, while the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed by 19.78 points, roughly 0.3%, to 7,832.\nAs for US data, core durable goods orders dropped 0.1% m/m in February to leave the 3-month average at 0.0%. \"That implies no acceleration in underlying investment which in turn suggests that potential US growth is not picking up and remains stuck around 1.9% y/y,\" analysts at ANZ Bank argued.

Bears will otherwise target all the way down to the 23.6% Fibo retracement of the late Dec swing lows to late Feb swing highs at the low end of the twenty-five hundreds.
