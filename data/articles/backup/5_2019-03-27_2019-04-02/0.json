As a result, just five minutes of system downtime can result in over 100 delayed flights and loss of revenue.\"\nWith this in mind, it is easy to see how the countless flight delay and cancellation issues faced by several major U.S. airlines were a result of malfunctions or outages within Aerodata's flight planning weight and balance program.\nSouthwest Airlines said in an official statement after the outage was over that:\nAs of 6:05am CDT, Southwest Airlines has lifted an internal ground stop implemented for about 40 minutes this morning during an outage with a vendor that services multiple carriers with data used in flight planning. Scattered flight delays are anticipated and Customers should check Southwest.com for the latest updates on specific flights.

EU-U.S. Trade Talks Face Delay, Risking Trump Backlash (Bloomberg) -- European Union governments are struggling to reach consensus on a mandate to begin trade talks with the U.S., risking a delay that would further provoke Donald Trump\u2019s ire after the bloc\u2019s refusal to include agriculture in the negotiations.\nAt a meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday, France is expected to resist giving the European Commission the green light to start negotiations to eliminate industrial tariffs between the regions, according to two officials familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the talks are private. Failure to get France on board would mean the EU\u2019s executive arm won\u2019t be given a mandate to negotiate.\nThe main sticking points include the role of climate and environment in the mandate given the U.S. decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord and a clarification of what this negotiation would mean for the shelved Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, according to the officials.\nA draft mandate prepared ahead of the meeting of ambassadors and seen by Bloomberg reiterates that the EU seeks trade accords only with countries that have signed up to the Paris agreement against climate change, even though the U.S. has pulled out.\nThe EU has been trying to kick start trade deliberations with the U.S. in a bid to show President Trump progress in enacting a political accord that he reached with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in July. That agreement helped put on hold the American threat of tariffs on European cars and auto parts.\nWashington has shown frustration over the lack of progress since, with U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland saying in a February interview that \u201cso long as the EU leadership plays the delay game the more we will have to use leverage to realign the relationship.\u201d\nEU-U.S. Trade Talks Face Delay, Risking Trump Backlash", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=179222828858436&u=https%3A%2F%2Fau.investing.com%2Fnews%2Feconomy-news%2Feuus-trade-talks-face-delay-risking-trump-backlash-1419888&display=popup&ref=plugin", "https://invst.ly/afnbj", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fau.investing.com%2Fnews%2Feconomy-news%2Feuus-trade-talks-face-delay-risking-trump-backlash-1419888&title=EU-U.S.+Trade+Talks+Face+Delay%2C+Risking+Trump+Backlash&summary="], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg \u00a9 reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "transatlantic trade and investment partnership", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T00:02:57.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ab4dc235aa10c497bb53caa80beb7b210932c5c6", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-tops-26000-as-us-china-data-points-to-stabilizing-global-slowdown-2019-04-01", "site_full": "www.marketwatch.com", "site": "marketwatch.com", "site_section": "https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/marketsummary", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Market Summary \u2013 US Stock Market Overview - Marketwatch", "title": "Dow tops 26,000 as U.S., China data points to stabilizing global slowdown", "title_full": "Dow tops 26,000 as U.S., China data points to stabilizing global slowdown - MarketWatch", "published": "2019-04-02T05:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 900, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4, "comments": 0, "shares": 21}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ab4dc235aa10c497bb53caa80beb7b210932c5c6", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-tops-26000-as-us-china-data-points-to-stabilizing-global-slowdown-2019-04-01", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sunny Oh", "published": "2019-04-02T05:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Dow tops 26,000 as U.S., China data points to stabilizing global slowdown", "text": "U.S. stocks kicked off the week with strong gains on Monday after better-than-expected Chinese and U.S. economic data suggested the slowdown in the global manufacturing industry may be easing.

Ellis, the federal judge who gained a reputation for his harshness toward special counsel Robert Mueller's prosecutors in the trial of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, have been dismissed, according to a new report.\nThe order from Judge Roger Gregory of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit quashes complaints lodged by four unnamed people who slammed Ellis' conduct in Manafort's trial as \"embarrassing\" and perhaps indicative of \"early onset dementia,\" according to a report Monday from BuzzFeed News .\nA source familiar with the matter told BuzzFeed that the complaints were lodged against Ellis, who is not named in the order published by the news outlet.\n\"Considering the district judge's remarks in their overall context, the record does not support the conclusion that the district judge engaged in misconduct,\" Gregory wrote in his order, which appears to have been filed Friday.\n\"The complainants have also failed to present, and the records do not disclose, any evidence of willful indifference to prevailing law or other misconduct,\" Gregory wrote. \"The record does not support the existence of an improper influence upon the judge, mental disability, or 'early onset dementia.'\"\nEllis, 78, gained extra media attention during the high-profile trial for his brusque, impatient style of addressing prosecutors on Mueller's team. He repeatedly urged prosecutors to hurry up with their arguments and admonished them for highlighting multiple examples of Manafort's expensive tastes.\nManafort is \"not on trial for having a lavish lifestyle,\" Ellis said at one point early in the trial . \"To parade all of this seems to me unnecessary, irrelevant and maybe unfairly prejudicial.\"\nOn another occasion, prosecutors filed a motion during the trial, saying that one of Ellis' outbursts against them could potentially prejudice the jury against them. Ellis apologized and instructed the jury to ignore his criticism.\nBefore the trial had even begun, Ellis accused prosecutors of lodging the charges against Manafort merely to pressure him into cooperating with Mueller's probe of Russian interference and possible Trump-campaign collusion during the 2016 election.\n\"You don't really care about Mr. Manafort's bank fraud,\" Ellis said at a hearing in May. \"You really care about what information he might give you about Mr. Trump and what might lead to his impeachment or prosecution.\"\nManafort, 70, served as then-candidate Donald Trump 's top campaign aide for several months in 2016. He was charged in two separate federal court districts by Mueller's grand jury, on charges that mostly pertained to work he performed years before joining Trump's campaign, as a political consultant for a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine.\nEllis presided over Manafort's trial in Alexandria, Va., district court in August. Manafort was convicted in that trial on eight criminal counts including tax fraud, bank fraud and failing to file a foreign bank account report. Ten other counts were deadlocked by the 12-member jury.\nManafort was sentenced in March to serve 47 months in federal prison \u2014 a much lighter sentence than federal sentencing guidelines called for. Ellis, who had already been criticized for his conduct during the trial, drew further ire from Mueller's supporters by saying that Manafort \"has lived an otherwise blameless life.\"\nManafort was sentenced to 43 additional months in his second case in Washington, D.C., federal court. Manafort's combined sentences will keep him behind bars for up to 7\u00bd years.\nA spokesman for the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, declined to comment on BuzzFeed's report. A spokesperson for the Fourth Circuit Appeals Court was unavailable to comment on the report because that building was flooded, a respondent told CNBC.\nThe four anonymous individuals tore into Ellis in their complaints accusing him of misconduct, according to BuzzFeed.\n\"Losing temper, or attacking motivations of officers of the court is not acceptable, particularly for federal judiciary,\" one complainant said.\nAnother complainant went much further, asserting that the judge's comments \"were demonstrably intended to embarrass either the witness for the government or the prosecutors in the case. In so doing, he inappropriately tilts the scales of justice against the prosecution and in favor of the defendant in the eyes of the jury.\"\nThat complaint added that either the judge \"has early onset dementia or he fails to understand his role as ... an impartial arbiter.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zoetillman/paul-manafort-judge-no-disciplinary-action-mueller", "https://www.scribd.com/document/403993620/3-29-19-Order-Ellis-Complaints", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-04/manafort-judge-questions-if-mueller-overstepped-his-authority"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul manafort", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "t.s. ellis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ellis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manafort", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gregory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buzzfeed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger gregory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "buzzfeed news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. court of appeals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fourth circuit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T00:05:31.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ef1013623d6f74c40fad360380af358426d64b7", "url": "https://paultan.org/2009/03/05/geneva-2009-the-new-lotus-exige-s-facelift", "site_full": "paultan.org", "site": "paultan.org", "site_section": "https://paultan.org/topics/special/2009-geneva-motor-show/page/4/", "site_categories": ["vehicles", "business"], "section_title": "2009 Geneva Motor Show Archives - Page 4 of 5 - Paul Tan's Automotive News", "title": "Geneva 2009: The new Lotus Exige S Facelift", "title_full": "Geneva 2009: The new Lotus Exige S Facelift", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.301, "main_image": "http://paultan.org/media2.paultan.org/image/lotus-exige-s-facelift-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3936, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1ef1013623d6f74c40fad360380af358426d64b7", "url": "https://paultan.org/2009/03/05/geneva-2009-the-new-lotus-exige-s-facelift", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Harvinder Sidhu", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Geneva 2009: The new Lotus Exige S Facelift", "text": "Proton-owned British-based sports car maker Lotus has launched the 2010 Lotus Exige S at the Geneva Motor Show in Switzerland.

Johnson\nWASHINGTON/SEATTLE, April 1 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Monday it planned to submit a proposed software enhancement package for the grounded 737 MAX in \"the coming weeks\" after the company had previously said it planned to deliver the fix for government approval by last week.\nThe company on Monday confirmed a statement from the Federal Aviation Administration that it would submit the upgrade later than previously announced.\nMore than 300 Boeing 737 MAX jets have been grounded worldwide after two crashes - in Indonesia in October and in Ethiopia last month - killed nearly 350 people.\nBoeing, facing one of its worst crises in years, is under pressure from crash victims' families, airlines, lawmakers in Washington and regulators around the world to prove that the automated flight control systems of its 737 MAX aircraft are safe and that pilots have the training required to override the system in an emergency.\nTwo people briefed on the matter said a Boeing review uncovered issues with \"integration\" when the new software is loaded into an aircraft. One of the people added that the issues uncovered had \"nothing to do with Ethiopian.\"\nOne analyst indicated it was too early to determine how much time this would add to the grounding, with approval from non-U.S. regulators still expected to be the main factor in determining when the planes would fly again globally.\nIn a sign the plane may be out of service for longer than some forecast, Southwest Airlines Co said on Monday it was \"publishing a revised schedule for April and May that is built around the currently available Southwest fleet and intends to reduce drastically last-minute trip disruptions and same-day cancellations.\"\nAmerican Airlines Group Inc said it was aware that the resumption of service for its 737 MAX aircraft may be further delayed and said it was working with all customers impacted by any flight cancellations.\nEarlier on Monday, FAA spokesman Greg Martin said that \"time is needed for additional work by Boeing as the result of an ongoing review of the 737 MAX Flight Control System to ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues.\"\nActing FAA Administrator Dan Elwell said last week the agency would not unground the planes until its analysis \"of the facts and technical data indicate that it is appropriate.\"\nOn Monday, the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee sent letters to Boeing and FAA seeking records related to the certification of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.\n\"Understanding where things went wrong is critically important because tragedies like this should not happen,\" said Representative Peter DeFazio, the committee's chair. \"These request letters represent only the start of our investigation and finding answers to our questions will take some time.\"\nDeFazio wants records related to pilot training and communication with international aviation authorities, officials said.\nBoeing said last week that it had reprogrammed software on its 737 MAX passenger jet to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system that is under mounting scrutiny following the two deadly nose-down crashes.\nThe world's largest planemaker said the anti-stall system, which is believed to have repeatedly forced the nose lower in the Indonesia accident, would only do so one time after sensing a problem, giving pilots more control.\nIt would also be disabled if two airflow sensors that measure the \"angle of attack,\" or angle of the wing to the airflow, a fundamental parameter of flight, offered widely different readings, Boeing said last week.\nFederal prosecutors, the Transportation Department's inspector general and U.S. lawmakers are investigating the FAA's certification of the 737 MAX.

Tesla Inc will pay a $31,000 penalty and purchase $55,000 in emergency response equipment for a California city under a settlement reached with the Environmental Protection Agency over federal hazardous waste violations at its automotive factory, the government said Monday.\nThe EPA said in a statement that Tesla will take specific steps to properly manage hazardous wastes at its factory after unannounced inspections in 2017 to its Fremont, California factory. The EPA said Tesla had failed to comply with air emissions standards for equipment leaks and management requirements for generators of hazardous wastes.\nTesla did not immediately comment. Tesla will provide at least $55,000 worth of emergency response equipment for the city of Fremont Fire Department as part of the settlement.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by James Dalgleish)\n 05:19 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tesla", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "james dalgleish", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david shepardson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. epa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fremont fire department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "environmental protection agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tesla inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fremont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T00:11:55.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ea571d1545097aa6175cab178c8bd28008f5f641", "url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/investment-ideas/article-us-bond-market-takes-worst-beating-in-three-months/", "site_full": "www.theglobeandmail.com", "site": "theglobeandmail.com", "site_section": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Globe and Mail: Canadian, World, Politics and Business News &amp; Analysis", "title": "U.S. bond market takes worst beating in three months", "title_full": "U.S. bond market takes worst beating in three months - The Globe and Mail", "published": "2019-04-02T00:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/Fo5qsmuxmMFow3rwSQ-kI5RO7Yc=/1200x0/filters:quality(80)/arc-anglerfish-tgam-prod-tgam.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HWFHBNGLM5BERLWFZ572DEHCTU.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2729, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ea571d1545097aa6175cab178c8bd28008f5f641", "url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/investment-ideas/article-us-bond-market-takes-worst-beating-in-three-months/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Richard Leong", "published": "2019-04-02T00:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "U.S. bond market takes worst beating in three months", "text": "Encouraging data on manufacturing activity spurs some investors to scale back their holdings The U.S. Treasury market posted its biggest one-day sell-off in three months on Monday, as encouraging data on manufacturing activity in the world\u2019s two biggest economies spurred some investors to scale back their holdings of safe-haven bonds. The bond market\u2019s wobbly start to the second quarter followed a solid first quarter, driven by worries about a global economic slowdown and the Federal Reserve signaling it would not raise interest rates in 2019.\n\u201cWe are going from a bad situation to a less bad situation. The (manufacturing data) had a impact for sure,\u201d said Ellis Phifer, senior market strategist at Raymond James in Memphis, Tennessee.\n Institute for Supply Management said its index on U.S. domestic factory activity rose to 55.3 in March, higher than what analysts polled by Reuters had expected.\nChina\u2019s manufacturing sector unexpectedly returned to growth for the first time in four months in March, data showed earlier on Monday. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) expanded at the strongest pace in eight months, rising to 50.8 from 49.9 in February.\nIn heavy-volume trading, the yield on U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose nearly 9 basis points for its biggest single-day jump since Jan. 4.

This market phenomenon preceded each recession in the past 50 years.\nWith 10-year yields back above three-month rates since Friday, analysts said the chances of a looming recession have faded a bit as data still suggest the economic expansion will likely persist in 2019.\nStill the surprise drop on U.S. retail sales in February reinforced the view of a deceleration in economic activity in the first quarter.\nLingering economic worries, analysts say, will limit the rise in bond yields following a solid first-quarter when Treasuries generated 2.1 percent total return based on data from Barclays and Bloomberg.\nTreasuries trailed a blockbuster quarter for Wall Street where the S&P 500 jumped 13.1 percent, which was the strongest quarterly gain since third quarter of 2009.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ellis phifer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raymond james", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "institute for supply management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "treasury", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "memphis", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T00:12:18.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "18f56932af6dadc97f9c577b6f33e68ab15a1966", "url": "https://www.nasdaq.com/article/us-stockswall-st-rallies-on-upbeat-china-us-manufacturing-data-20190401-01222", "site_full": "www.nasdaq.com", "site": "nasdaq.com", "site_section": "https://www.nasdaq.com/news/", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Stock Exchange News - Latest Stock Market News &amp; Analysis - Nasdaq", "title": "US STOCKS-Wall St rallies on upbeat China, U.S. manufacturing data", "title_full": "US STOCKS-Wall St rallies on upbeat China, U.S. manufacturing data - Nasdaq.com", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.256, "main_image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/images/dreamit.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2975, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "18f56932af6dadc97f9c577b6f33e68ab15a1966", "url": "https://www.nasdaq.com/article/us-stockswall-st-rallies-on-upbeat-china-us-manufacturing-data-20190401-01222", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Reuters", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "US STOCKS-Wall St rallies on upbeat China, U.S. manufacturing data", "text": "Shutterstock photo\n* Banks climb as U.S. yields hit 1-week high\n* Chipmakers rise on positive China data\n* Lyft drops below IPO price on second day of trading\nBy April Joyner\nNEW YORK, April 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Monday,starting off the second quarter on a strong note, as upbeatmanufacturing numbers from China and the United States easedworries about slowing global growth.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 index, which is only 2.2 percent belowits record closing high in September, triggered a \"golden cross\"pattern, in which its 50-day moving average crosses above its200-day moving average.

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo More By Caroline Humer NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Monday said it would increase by 2.53 percent on average 2020 payments to the health insurers that manage Medicare Advantage insurance plans for seniors and the disabled, a reflection of a new estimate on medical cost growth. The rate, which affects how much insurers charge for monthly healthcare premiums, plan benefits and, ultimately, how much they profit, represents an increase over the 1.59 percent increase proposed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in February. The government raised the final payment rate from the proposed rate after revising its estimate for increases in medical services for next year. Its final estimate of that growth rate is 5.62 percent compared with 4.59 percent in its February proposal. \"Most of the puts-and-takes remained the same as proposed, but CMS upped the growth rate, which is definitely helpful in 2020,\" said Ipsita Smolinski, managing director at healthcare research consulting firm Capitol Street. Medicare Advantage plans serve more than 20 million people, most of them aged 65 and older. Shares in insurers were unchanged in after hours trading. UnitedHealth Group Inc, Humana Inc, CVS Health Corp, through its acquisition of Aetna, and WellCare Health Plans Inc are the largest sellers of Medicare Advantage health insurance. Under the program, they are paid a set rate by the government to cover member healthcare costs. In addition to medical costs, the government's 2020 payment rate also factors in other changes in policies, such as quality of care related payments that may result in declines or increases from year to year. For instance, the 2020 rate reflected a decline in payments of 3.08 percent related to the Affordable Care Act requirement that Medicare Advantage and fee-for-service Medicare have the same payment structure. Starting in 2020, Medicare Advantage plans will also be able to offer supplemental non-health related benefits to chronically ill enrollees that address their social needs, CMS Administrator Seema Verma said. Those can include needed structural changes to the home, such as adding ramps and widening doorways. The plans can tailor these offerings to individuals, and the offerings could increase competition between plans, Verma said. Previously, plans have only been allowed to offer health related benefits. Medicare Advantage competes with the traditional Medicare fee-for-service program. Both have grown as the \"Baby Boomer\" generation ages into Medicare. Together, they cover more than 55 million people.

And why no action against the perpetrators known to be in the United States? 04.01.19 1:21 PM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Getty/Shutterstock\nSEOUL\u2013The more the Americans shrug off any role in the bizarre February 22 raid on the North Korean embassy in Madrid, the deeper suspicions grow here in Seoul that the U.S. intelligence community had a lot to do with it.\nThe alleged ringleader of the attack, Yale-educated Adrian Hong Chang, has long dreamed of overthrowing the North Korean regime, which may seem like empty boasting. But the silence of U.S. officials is downright deafening.\nHong, as he is known, purportedly turned over to the FBI super-secret stuff that he and his nine mates looted from the embassy. The group did so, said a proud statement published on its website, at \u201cthe request\u201d of the FBI.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any comment,\u201d an FBI spokesperson told The Daily Beast when asked if the bureau knew anything about these guys or digital equipment they seized in their attack five days before President Donald Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Hanoi.\nThat response came after the State Department flatly denied any U.S. role in the raid, in which a senior North Korean diplomat was beaten up, hog-tied, and left in a basement room with a hood over his head after refusing to defect.\nNorth Korea, known more formally as the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea or DPRK, on Sunday intruded into the uneasy silence of U.S. officialdom by issuing its first statement on the whole thing.\nIt carefully implicated the FBI while minimizing the significance of a gang that may pose more than an annoyance to Kim\u2019s dictatorship.\nPyongyang\u2019s Korean Central News Agency, quoting an anonymous foreign ministry spokesman, said the regime is indeed \u201cfollowing the rumors of all hues now in the air that FBI of the U.S.\u201d was \u201cinvolved in the terror incident.\u201d Also in on the plot, said KCNA, were \u201cthe small fry of anti-DPRK \u2018body\u2019\u201d\u2014an allusion to Hong\u2019s group now known as Jayu Joseon, meaning Free [North] Korea.\nCompounding the mystery was how all 10 embassy invaders managed to get clean away. Mastermind Hong, an activist who formed an outfit named LINK, Liberty in North Korea, shortly before graduating from Yale University in 2005, managed to get into the U.S. with at least one and possibly other Jayu Joseon members.\nThis was after they made it to Lisbon, 400 miles to the east of Madrid, slipped through Portuguese airport security and boarded a plane or planes to Newark, N.J., leaving the Spanish police looking like a bunch of keystone cops scratching their heads over what happened.\nThe North Koreans, for their part, left no doubt about their disgust with the ease the group had raiding and pillaging the Madrid embassy one dark evening while Kim Jong Un was figuring out what to say to Donald Trump when they were to meet on February 27 and 28. (The summit did not go well.)\nThe KCNA statement urged the Spanish to \u201ccarry out an investigation into the incident to the last in a responsible manner in order to bring the terrorists and their wire-pullers to justice in conformity with the relevant international law.\" The statement added the obvious, that \"an illegal intrusion into and occupation of a diplomatic mission and act of extortion are a grave breach of state sovereignty and a flagrant violation of international law, and this kind of act should never be tolerated.\"\nIn fact, published details of the Spanish authorities\u2019 investigation make it appear the FBI was at the center of their search for Hong\u2019s gang\u2014several of whom are believed to be Korean-Americans.\nThe assumption here in Seoul has been that the failure of the U.S. to respond to Spain\u2019s extradition request for Hong and at least one of his cohorts implies FBI or other U.S. government involvement.\nSpanish authorities say the FBI neglected for nearly four weeks to let them know that Hong had contacted the bureau about computers, hard drives and a mobile phone captured in the raid.\nThae Yong Ho, the second ranking diplomat at North Korea\u2019s embassy in London when he defected with his wife and two sons nearly three years ago, believes they got away with a crucial computer that \u201cdeciphers telegrams shared between Pyongyang and the embassy overseas.\u201d\nAt a minimum, the loot seized by the Madrid 10 could have had messages and files of highly sensitive, secret information about North Korea\u2019s nuclear-and-missile program and strategy for talks on denuclearization with the U.S. and South Korea. Or so they thought.\n\u201cThese actions have raised hopes that Free Joseon may be the revolutionary organization that Koreans have longed for to end the despotic rule of mafia-like crime family cult known as the Kim family regime,\u201d says David Maxwell, a retired U.S. army special forces colonel now with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cThe sudden prominence of Free Joseon is undoubtedly an unconventional warfare practitioner\u2019s dream; it is a nascent organization with the potential to coerce, disrupt, or overthrow a government or occupying power.\u201d\nMaxwell qualifies this fantasy, however, noting, \u201cUnfortunately, when things are too good to be true, they usually are.\u201d Realistically, he says \u201cthe excitement over this development must be tempered with an objective analysis of the organization, its legitimacy, its objectives, and how it can fit into the larger strategy of the South Korean-U.S. alliance.\u201d\nA court in Madrid has requested extradition of Hong and one other man, Sam Ryu, a U.S. citizen, both of whom arrived at Newark on that flight from Lisbon the day after the raid.\nJayu Joseon, formerly known as Cheollima Civil Defense, has said on its website that the information bequeathed the FBI had \u201cenormous potential value.\u201d\nHong may have had dealings with the FBI already\u2014agents he felt confident providing with whatever was seized. Otherwise, after working for years on behalf of North Korean defectors to undermine the North Korean regime, Hong would have known to contact the CIA, whose spooks do their snooping outside the U.S., rather than the FBI, whose gumshoes track down domestic sins. It is also possible the CIA did not trust him, and the FBI was more open to his offerings.\nSpanish police initially said two of the raiders, including Hong, had links with the CIA. Here in Seoul it\u2019s widely assumed the Americans at least know who and where to find Hong and Ryu\u2014if they are not already in U.S. custody.\nAs for a possible South Korean role, President Moon Jae-in is so eager for reconciliation and dialogue with the North that the South\u2019s National Intelligence Service is not believed to have had a hand in the raid even though the NIS would presumably have files on Hong and some of the others. The possible role of former NIS operatives, many of whom have been dismissed under Moon, is not clear.\n\"We're keeping a close eye on the case since people with South Korean or U.S. nationalities could be involved,\" was all the NIS would say in a statement to Korean lawmakers. \"There may be a South Korean, but nothing has been confirmed.\"\nJayu Joseon on its website has responded with a mixture of embarrassment and anger over the publicity surrounding the raid. Hong is presumed to have written the statements, which Koreans say are cast in a somewhat awkward, pretentious style typical of one who knows Korean but was educated largely abroad.\nOne such statement claimed to have provided information to the FBI on the understanding no one would know about it. \u201cWe ourselves never spoke to the media or shared any information,\u201d said Jayu Joseon, blasting media leaks as \u201ca profound betrayal of trust\u201d that would \u201caid and abet the regime in Pyongyang\u201d while endangering those \u201cwho take risks to protect others.\u201d\nThe group also said it was suspending activities after having been exposed and compromised by all the attention. But that didn\u2019t stop them from warning Sunday night: \u201cWe are now preparing for big events,\u201d and \u201cuntil then we will remain silent like the calm before the storm.\" The reason was clear. \"The more the Kim Jong-un regime rejects freedom's orders, such as the dismantlement of political prison camps the more humiliation it will experience.\u201d\nThe group might actually have made a totally clean escape in Madrid, sans publicity, but for one close call that almost got them caught in the act. The wife of one of the embassy workers, in a downstairs room when they piled into the building, locked the door to the room, clambered through the window and alerted a passerby, who called police.\nHong, sporting a North Korea pin in his lapel, reportedly came to the door and assured a policeman there was no problem.\nWhat happened when they made it to the United States? Did they just waltz through U.S. immigration?\nHong, initially described as a Mexican-American but a legal U.S. \u201cresident,\u201d may also have been carrying a U.S. passport or green card. Again, there has been no comment one way or another from U.S. authorities. Certainly he has spent a great deal of time in the United States. He was a student at Yale when he founded LINK, dedicated to rescuing North Korean refugees. He left that organization, headquartered in Long Beach, California, 10 years ago but has shown up in the U.S. and Canada making clear the need for regime change in North Korea and calling for training new leaders and bureaucrats capable of taking over.\n\u201cNo action on North Korea is without risk, but inaction has only brought mass atrocities, weapons proliferation, and emboldened criminal behavior,\u201d he wrote in an opinion piece for the Christian Science Monitor five years ago. \u201cOur collective inaction has allied us with the oppressor, not the oppressed.\u201d\nIn a portent of what was to come, a note at the bottom of the piece identifies him as managing director of Pegasus Strategies, whose avowed purpose is to \u201cteach you how to use\u2026 the right firearm\u201d rather than treat it as \u201cjust an ornament.\u201d The note adds that he visited North Korea in 2008, presumably on a brief standard tourist excursion.\nIn his wake in Madrid, Hong left behind one intriguing detail. In the rush to leave, he dropped an Italian driver\u2019s license bearing a fake name but determined to be his. That has raised questions among analysts about his possible involvement in the defection a few weeks earlier of North Korea\u2019s ambassador to Italy, who has not been seen or heard from since. That deed would help to explain why Hong and his gang believed they might persuade the North Korean diplomat in charge of the Madrid embassy, So Yun Sok, to defect.\nIf they roughed up So and others, as alleged, it may have been to try to extract codes and passwords for the hard drives and other stuff they seized. So was left in charge of the embassy after the last ambassador, Kim Hyok Chol, was kicked out of Spain after the North\u2019s last missile test in September 2017. Kim then surfaced in negotiations with Stephen Biegun, U.S. envoy on North Korea.\nJayu Joseon spent several hours inside the embassy. The day of the raid, Hong stopped by a police store selling fake pistols, holsters, knives, chains, handcuffs, ropes, and other paraphernalia needed to constrain eight people known to be there. He also reportedly equipped everyone on his team with micro cameras tucked into their dark suits, recording everything they did.\nBut don\u2019t wait expectantly for the beneficiaries of the attack, whoever they might be, to come forward with an account of what happened, what they got, and what\u2019s become of Hong and his crew.\n\u201cIt has to all be denied officially,\u201d said Steve Tharp, who\u2019s made a career here analyzing North Korea issues as an army officer and then as a senior civilian with the U.S. command. Assuming there is outside involvement, Tharp said, \u201cThat's how the black side works.\u201d\nSpencer Ackerman also contributed to this story.

The House Committee on Oversight and Reform is scheduled to vote on issuing subpoenas for documents and testimony relating to its investigation into the addition of a question on citizenship to the 2020 census. Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings' requests dovetail with legal challenges to the question, which critics contend is aimed at suppressing the official count of non-citizens in the census. Two federal judges have blocked the question from being added, and the Supreme Court will hear the case later this month. Here are the details on the simmering controversy: 2020 census and citizenship The count of the nation\u2019s population begins April 1, 2020. The decennial survey is key to apportioning congressional districts and determining the distribution of federal funds to schools, health systems, highway projects and other programs. The information helps determine the annual distribution of $675 billion in federal funds. Steven Dillingham, United States Census Bureau director, speaks about the upcoming census at the National Press Club on Monday. More Census Bureau officials held a press conference Monday to outline the bureau\u2019s preparations, including a national ad campaign and partnerships with grassroots groups to reach people, particularly communities of color. The Commerce Department announced one year ago that it would ask every household about citizenship for the first time since 1950. Other decennial censuses have asked about citizenship only on the \"long form,\" which goes to 1 in 6 households. The last time was for the 2000 census. More: Census officials await Supreme Court decision on whether to add, drop citizenship question The question also has been asked since then as part of the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, but that polls only a fraction of U.S. households. The administration's justification was that the question is needed to count minorities accurately, so that their rights can be protected. Challenges to the question A wide range of critics , including the American Civil Liberties Union and the states of California and New York, charged that adding the question was nothing more than an attempt to intimidate non-citizens from participating in the census. That could cause them to be undercounted, possibly resulting in the loss of federal funds and congressional representation. The challengers alleged a political motive with roots in the White House, noting that Ross had consulted with Steve Bannon, President Donald Trump's chief strategist at the start of his administration. Can you believe that the Radical Left Democrats want to do our new and very important Census Report without the all important Citizenship Question. Report would be meaningless and a waste of the $Billions (ridiculous) that it costs to put together! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2019 During a hearing last month , Cummings cited discussions between Ross and Bannon as early as July 2017, months before the Justice Department formally asked to include the citizenship question. He said Ross also discussed the matter with Kris Kobach, who led Trump's short-lived presidential commission on voter fraud. Ross has said all along that the decision had nothing to do with politics. He told the committee that the Bannon and Kobach talks came early in his tenure as Commerce secretary, while he was learning about the census and conducting research on the citizenship issue. \"I wanted to make sure that we had enough time to adequately consider any formal request that DOJ might make,\" he told the House committee in March. The trials on the question In January, U.S. District Court Judge Jesse Furman in New York ruled that Ross exceeded his authority by adding the citizenship question. In a 277-page ruling, Furman called Ross's contention that he based his decision on a Justice Department request a \"sham justification.\" He said Ross made his decision for other reasons, then tried to conceal his motives by getting the Justice Department to make the request. \"The court can \u2013 and, in light of all the evidence in the record, does \u2013 infer from the various ways in which Secretary Ross and his aides acted like people with something to hide that they did have something to hide,\" Furman said. In March, U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg in Calilfornia also struck down the question, ruling that its inclusion would lead to such drastic population undercounts that it \"threatens the very foundation of our democratic system.\" In his 126-page decision, Seeborg said the trial record indicated that Ross called for the citizenship question after consulting with Bannon, Kobach and others. \"Secretary Ross does not wish his reason for requesting the inclusion of the citizenship question on the 2020 census to come to light,\" the judge concluded. The House committee's involvement Frustrated by Ross's refusal to answer some questions last month, Cummings is seeking to subpoena in particular a memorandum and note from Commerce Department counsel James Uthmeier to John Gore, the acting assistant attorney general for civil rights in the Justice Department. He also is demanding Gore's appearance before the panel. In addition, Cummings is seeking \"all documents and communications\" relating to the citizenship question for most of 2017, both within the Justice Department and with outside entities, including the White House, the Trump presidential campaign and the Republican National Committee. The agency said in a statement Monday it \"has cooperated in good faith with the committee and will look to do so in the future.\u201d \u201cThe Department has delivered over 11,000 pages of documents pertaining to the Committee\u2019s request and the Secretary himself voluntarily testified for nearly seven hours on these issues two weeks ago,'' said an agency spokesman. Now what? The Supreme Court granted the Trump administration's request to hear the case, now scheduled for oral argument April 23. The justices previously had ruled that Ross could not be questioned by lawyers for those seeking to block the citizenship question, but that Gore could be questioned. A decision from the high court is expected by the end of June \u2013 just in time for census questionnaires to be printed the following month.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://oversight.house.gov/legislation/business-meetings/full-committee-business-meeting-1&quot;", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/15/supreme-court-decide-2020-census-ask-citizenship/2851849002/&quot;", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/06/2020-census-citizenship-question-struck-down-second-federal-judge-trump/3082281002/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/06/2020-census-citizenship-question-struck-down-second-federal-judge-trump/3082281002/&quot;", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1112702018383212544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/01/15/supreme-court-citizenship-question-census/2579017002/&quot;", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/14/commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-defends-citizenship-question-2020-census-house-democrats/3160351002/&quot;", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/03/26/citizenship-question-put-back-2020-census/461044002/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/15/supreme-court-decide-2020-census-ask-citizenship/2851849002/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/03/27/california-sues-trump-administration-over-census-citizenship-question/462241002/&quot;", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/10/22/census-supreme-court-sides-government-over-citizenship-question/1605067002/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/10/22/census-supreme-court-sides-government-over-citizenship-question/1605067002/&quot;", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/03/27/california-sues-trump-administration-over-census-citizenship-question/462241002/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/03/26/citizenship-question-put-back-2020-census/461044002/&quot;", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/14/commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-defends-citizenship-question-2020-census-house-democrats/3160351002/", "https://www.tumblr.com/widgets/share/tool?posttype=photo&content=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fuu%2Fapi%2Fres%2F1.2%2FkPnPANNZuUqRxEhS27tPqw--~B%2FaD0yODQ5O3c9NDI3NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fmedia.zenfs.com%2Fen-US%2Fhomerun%2Fusa_today_news_641%2F65b08fd865153f4a6c53b1a61444aba6&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.yahoo.com%2Fcensus-citizenship-might-spark-house-205610022.html%3Fsoc_src%3Dsocial-sh%26soc_trk%3Dtu&clickthroughUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.yahoo.com%2Fcensus-citizenship-might-spark-house-205610022", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/01/15/supreme-court-citizenship-question-census/2579017002/", "https://oversight.house.gov/legislation/business-meetings/full-committee-business-meeting-1"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barr richard wolf", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "elijah cummings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deborah barfield berry reblog", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "william barr", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ag", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "house committee on oversight and reform", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T00:16:47.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e0731c238de62605f72c5f11f579658a3d8f43be", "url": "https://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/3739077/posts", "site_full": "www.freerepublic.com", "site": "freerepublic.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/fr", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Forum: News/Activism", "title": "Exclusive: U.S. sends message to Turkey, halts F-35 equipment shipments -

The Canadian Press 12:18AM EDT Last Updated Monday, April 1, 2019 7:26PM EDT\nTORONTO -- North American stock markets opened the second quarter higher Monday on unexpected manufacturing growth in China and positive data in the U.S.\nEverybody was writing off China and stoking fears of a possible recession, but positive manufacturing data signals that forecasts of doom and gloom may have been misplaced, says Allan Small, senior investment adviser at HollisWealth.\n\"Well China data was good, so that rally looks like some of the initiatives that government is taking over there, some of the stimulus is kicking in,\" he said in an interview.\nThe monthly purchasing managers' index rose above 50 for the first time in several months, pointing to increased activity. An economic report out of China also showed growth in exports, employment and orders.\nPositive news also came out of the United States, with manufacturers growing at a faster pace in March and construction spending increasing in February. However, retail sales fell in February.\n\"We're waiting for some more data this week and perhaps it's not as bad as people think, and if we can ever get a deal between the U.S. and China, I think this market goes higher,\" Small added.\nChinese and U.S. negotiations are set to resume in Washington this week after U.S. officials pointed to positive movement last week in Beijing.\nThe S&P/TSX composite index closed up 125.97 points to 16,228.06 Monday in the first day of trading in April and the second quarter.\nSmall said it's premature to say the second three months of 2019 will mirror the first three, which saw the Toronto market gain 12.4 per cent.\n\"You're looking historically at a pretty good month,\" he said of April.\n\"You never know what happens tomorrow but I'll take it today and enjoy it.\"\nSeven of the market's 11 major sectors rose, led by consumer discretionary, along with the powerhouse energy, financials and industrials sectors.\nEnergy gained as the price of crude hit a near five-month high on hopeful signs of higher demand from China. Cenovus Energy Inc. rose 4.7 per cent on the day.\nThe May crude contract was up US$1.45 at US$61.59 per barrel and the May natural gas contract was up 4.6 cents at $2.71 per mmBTU.\nFinancials was up on a stabilizing yield curve after it inverted last week. Laurentian Bank, Toronto-Dominion and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce were up nearly two per cent.\nMaterials led on the downside as metals prices fell.\nThe June gold contract was down US$4.30 at US$1,294.20 an ounce and the May copper contract was down 1.1 cents at US$2.92 a pound.\nThe Canadian dollar traded at an average of 74.98 cents US, up from an average of 74.83 cents US on Friday.\nIn New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 329.74 points at 26,258.42. The S&P 500 index was up 32.79 points at 2,867.19, while the Nasdaq composite was up 99.59 points at 7,828.91.\nDespite warnings about softer economic growth, Small sees markets improving with the right catalyst.\n\"I think the catalyst is going to have to come from something and I keep coming back to politics and trade.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "s&p/tsx", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T00:23:37.036+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a07ed5ee6713a3caa1e7eda3df0b888f7312f993", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/differences-between-the-tesla-model-s-and-model-3-2019-3", "site_full": "www.businessinsider.com", "site": "businessinsider.com", "site_section": "http://www.businessinsider.com/transportation.rss", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "Transportation", "title": "Here are all the differences between Tesla's sedans \u2014 the Model S and Model 3 (TSLA)", "title_full": "Here are all the differences between Tesla's sedans \u2014 the Model S and Model 3 (TSLA)", "published": "2019-04-02T00:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5aea218e19ee864a008b47a4-1536-768.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 283, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a07ed5ee6713a3caa1e7eda3df0b888f7312f993", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/differences-between-the-tesla-model-s-and-model-3-2019-3", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Matthew DeBord", "published": "2019-04-02T00:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Here are all the differences between Tesla's sedans \u2014 the Model S and Model 3 (TSLA)", "text": "Currently, Tesla sells three versions of the Model S, each with a \"dual motor\" all-wheel-drive configuration. Spencer Platt/Getty Images The Standard Range is $79,000 to start, with a 270-mile range and a 0-60mph time of 4.2 seconds. The Long Range is $83,000, with a 335-miles range and a 0-60mph time of 4.1 seconds. The Performance is $99,000, with a 315-mile range and a 0-60 time of 3 seconds. (These prices are all before tax credits and fuel savings.) 3 / Adding Ludicrous Mode to the Performance trim for $15,000 takes the 0-60 mph time down to 2.4 seconds. That's supercar fast. Mark Ralston/AFP 4 / Model S owners used to be able to use the company's network of almost 1,500 Supercharger locations to recharge for free. Now, new Model S owners have to pay; the rate is $0.28 per kilowatt hour. The Model S can also recharge at slower Level 2 partner sites, at home using a Level 2 system, or with a regular wall outlet to \"trickle\" charge or top off. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider 5 / The Model S interior comes in basic black standard, regardless of trim. A few different interior options are on offer, for an extra $1,500. Exterior colors that aren't black also add $1,000, on up to \"red multi-coat,\" which is $2,500. Tesla 6 / The Model S has a traditional, albeit digital, instrument cluster for the driver. The steering wheel is heated, and the front seats are heated and cooled. Hollis Johnson 7 / The Model S is equipped with a large, 17-inch portrait central touchscreen that controls climate and infotainment, as well as many vehicle settings. The screen is angled slightly toward the driver. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider 8 / The Model S key fob is a sleek little guy that resembles the car. You can also use the Tesla app to control some features, monitor charging, and check on the Model S's vital signs. AP/Carlos Osorio 9 / You have almost 63 cubic feet of total cargo capacity with the Model S, if you drop the rear seats to expand the hatch and make use of the front trunk, or \"frunk.\" The Model S can beat some SUVs for hauling capability. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider 10 / The Model S has ample space in the back seat for three kids, and two adults would be relatively comfortable. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider 11 / The Model S can be had with Autopilot, Tesla's semi-self-driving system. The basic driver-assist system is $3,000 on order, $4,000 post-delivery. Adding full self-driving is $5,000 on order, $7,000 post-delivery. Mark Matousek / Business Insider 12 / The Model 3 is Tesla's newest vehicle. The compact sedan launched in mid-2017. Initially, only \"premium,\" long-range versions were made, but a pricey Performance trim followed, and most recently a $35,000 base car arrived. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Tesla currently sells two versions of the Model 3: single-motor rear-wheel-drive and dual-motor all-wheel drive. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider The RWD Standard range is $35,000, with 220 miles of range and a 0-60mph time of 5.6 seconds. The RWD Standard Range Plus with partial premium interior is $37,000, with 240 miles of range and a o-60 mph time of 5.3 seconds. The RWD Mid Range premium interior is $40,000, with 264 miles of range and a 0-60 mph time of 5.2 seconds. The RWD Long Range premium interior is $43,000, with 325 miles of range and 0-60 mph time of 5 seconds. The AWD Long Range premium interior is $47,000, with 310 miles of range and a 0-60 mph time of 4.5 seconds. And the AWD Performance premium interior is $58,000, with 310 miles of range and a 0-60 mph time of 3.2 seconds. (These prices are all before tax credits and fuel savings.) 14 / There is no Ludicrous Mode for the Model 3 Performance. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider 15 / The Model 3 is subject to the same charging protocols and costs as the Model S, although the Model 3 uses a different battery architecture. Matthew DeBord/BI 16 / The Model 3's interior is far more minimalist than the Model S's. Exterior paint pricing is the same as the Model S. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider The central landscape touchscreen controls infotainment, most vehicle functions, and displays your speedometer. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider The Model 3 does away with the key fob. Instead, there's a credit-card-sized valet/backup key ... Hollis Johnson/Business Insider ... But the car's real key is the smartphone app. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider 20 / The Model 3 offers much less cargo space than the Model S \u2014 just 15 cubic feet between the trunk and frunk. But that's still plenty for everything but full-family road trips over long weekends. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider 21 / With the Model 3, you get smaller back seats, but you also get a show-stopping panoramic glass roof that runs from the windshield to the rear hatch.

But serenely, calmly, without a commotion and with great prudence and responsibility.\u201d\nLopez Obrador declined to reveal whether the government was taking preparations for a possible shutdown of the border, saying he did not want to get ahead of himself.\nThe leftist Mexican president has consistently refused to get drawn into a war of words with Trump over the border.\nInstead, he has sought to persuade Trump to help tackle the problem by fostering economic development in Central America. However, on Saturday the U.S. State Department said it was cutting off aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.\nReporting by Dave Graham; Additional reporting by Sharay Angulo; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Grant McCool Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and may not reflect those of Kitco Metals Inc.

Sign up here!\n(Kitco News) - Gold and silver prices are modestly down in early-afternoon U.S. trading Monday. Trading has been choppy and on both sides of unchanged in both metals today. A rally in the U.S. stock market and a rebound in the U.S. dollar index from its overnight weakness worked to pressure the precious metals markets today. June gold futures were last down $3.50 an ounce at $1,295.00. May Comex silver was last down $0.01 at $15.10 an ounce.\nOn this first day of the second quarter, Asian and European stock indexes were also mostly higher overnight. China got some upbeat manufacturing data to boost Asian and European shares Monday. The Caixin-Markit China purchasing managers index (PMI) came in at 50.5 in March from 49.2 in February. A reading above 50.0 suggests growth in the sector.\nThe U.S. retail sales report, released this morning, showed a drop of 0.2% in February, which was a downside miss from expectations of a 0.2% rise. This report did put some brief downside price pressure on the U.S. dollar index, which in turn helped to lift gold and silver prices above unchanged for a short while.\nThe Euro zone jobless rate was reported at 7.8% in February, which is unchanged from January and in line with market expectations. The Euro zone March consumer price index came in at up 1.4%, year-on-year, versus up 1.5% in February. The March CPI reading was just a bit below trade expectations, continuing a worldwide theme of very low inflation. Last autumn, notions among many economists and market watchers were growing that inflation was creeping back into the world marketplace, and possibly becoming problematic. Those ideas have all but disappeared now. Commodity markets, including the precious metals, could use some higher inflation levels to help boost their prices.\nMinneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari said Monday now is not the time to lower U.S. interest rates. While he said risks to the U.S. economy have increased, Kashkari said the Fed needs more time to see if those risks pan out. He said he is worried about low inflation. Kashkari was interviewed by the Wall Street Journal and is one of the Fed\u2019s more dovish members on U.S. monetary policy.\nThe other key outside market today is in a bullish posture for the metals markets, as Nymex crude oil prices are higher, hit a 4.5-month high and are trading above $61.00 a barrel.\nTechnically, June gold futures prices closed nearer the session low today. The bulls still have the overall near-term technical advantage but have faded badly recently and need to show fresh power soon to avoid more serious chart damage being inflicted. Gold bulls' next upside near-term price breakout objective is to produce a close above solid technical resistance at the March high of $1,330.80. Bears' next near-term downside price breakout objective is pushing prices below solid technical support at the March low of $1,287.50. First resistance is seen at $1,300.00 and then at Friday\u2019s high of $1,304.60. First support is seen at last week\u2019s low of $1,291.30 and then at $1,287.50. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 6.0\nMay silver futures prices closed near mid-range today. The silver bears have gained the slight overall near-term technical advantage. A five-week-old downtrend has been re-established on the daily bar chart. Silver bulls' next upside price breakout objective is closing prices above solid technical resistance at the March high of $15.65 an ounce. The next downside price breakout objective for the bears is closing prices below solid support at $14.50. First resistance is seen at $15.25 and then at $15.315. Next support is seen at last week\u2019s low of $14.95 and then at $14.75. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 4.5.\nMay N.Y. copper closed down 85 points at 292.70 cents today. Prices closed near the session low today after spiking to a nine-month high early on. The copper bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage. Copper bulls' next upside price objective is pushing and closing prices above solid technical resistance at 300.00 cents. The next downside price objective for the bears is closing prices below solid technical support at the March low of 283.45 cents. First resistance is seen at 297.80 cents and then at today\u2019s high of 298.85 cents. First support is seen at 290.00 cents and then at 287.80 cents.

The FLSA mandates that workers be paid the minimum wage and overtime, among other requirements.\nPublication of the rule kicked off a 60-day public comment period.\nUnder the proposal, companies would be considered joint employers only if they hire, fire, and supervise employees, set their pay, and maintain employment records. That would likely exclude many franchisors and companies that hire contract labor.\nThe Obama administration\u2019s guidance included several other factors, such as the nature of the work being performed and whether workers were integral to a company\u2019s business. That definition of joint employment had rankled the business community, which said it threatened the franchise business model and would lead to a spike in lawsuits.\nMatt Haller, vice president at the International Franchise Association, a trade group, said the Obama-era rule had led to frivolous lawsuits and changed the way franchisors interacted with franchisees.\n\u201cThrough this proposal, the Department of Labor has the chance to undo one of the most harmful economic regulations from the past administration,\u201d he said.\nThe Obama-era regulation was not legally binding, but Monday\u2019s proposal would be if it is adopted. That would make it more difficult for future administrations to undo, but also open it up to legal challenges.\nThe proposal comes as the National Labor Relations Board is moving to roll back a separate Obama-era standard for determining joint employment under federal labor law, which governs union organizing and workers\u2019 rights to advocate for better working conditions. Under a rule the NLRB proposed in September, companies would have to possess direct control over working conditions to be considered the joint employer of franchise or contract workers.\nReporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Matthew Lewis Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and may not reflect those of Kitco Metals Inc.

As of March 26, approximately 370 migrants had been returned to Mexico, a Mexican official told Reuters last week.\nAsked about the numbers, a DHS spokeswoman declined to confirm them and said the policy \u201cis still in the early stages of implementation.\u201d\nThe policy is aimed at curbing the flow of mostly Central American migrants trying to enter the United States. Trump administration officials say a system that allows asylum seekers to remain in the country for years while waiting for their cases to move through a backlogged immigration court system encourages illegal immigration.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and other groups sued the Trump administration over the policy, claiming it violates U.S. law.\nBut following a March 22 hearing on whether the program should be halted, U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco ordered both sides to submit further briefing on the question of whether or not the California court has jurisdiction to preside over the case, likely prolonging any decision on the policy.\nReporting by Yeganeh Torbati; Editing by Grant McCool and Meredith Mazzilli Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and may not reflect those of Kitco Metals Inc.

Still, the economy\u2019s improving prospects were not expected to have any impact on the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision last month to abruptly end its three-year campaign to tighten monetary policy.\nThe U.S. central bank abandoned projections for any interest rate hikes this year after increasing borrowing costs four times in 2018, acknowledging rising headwinds, including a fading stimulus from $1.5 trillion in tax cuts, trade wars, slowing global growth and uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union.\n\u201cThe economic downslide may be over but there are no clear indications that an acceleration in growth is at hand,\u201d said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. \u201cThe Fed has reason to watch and wait.\u201d\nRetail sales dropped 0.2 percent as households cut back on purchases of furniture, clothing, food and electronics and appliances, as well as building materials and gardening equipment. But January\u2019s sales increase was revised up to 0.7 percent from the previously reported 0.2 percent.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales rising 0.3 percent in February. Retail sales in February advanced 2.2 percent from a year ago.\nThe surprise drop in sales in February could partly reflect delays in processing tax refunds in the middle of the month. Tax refunds have also been smaller on average compared to prior years following the revamping of the tax code in January 2018. Cold and snowy weather could also have hurt sales.\nExcluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales fell 0.2 percent in February after an upwardly revised 1.7 percent surge in January. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.\nThey were previously reported to have rebounded 1.1 percent in January. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity. While the upward revision to core retail sales did not reverse December\u2019s 2.2 percent plunge, it put consumer spending for the first-quarter on a slightly higher growth trajectory than before.\nThere was a further boost to first-quarter GDP prospects, with a second report from the Commerce Department showing construction spending rose 1.0 percent to a nine-month high in February after surging 2.5 percent in January.\nA third report from the department showed business inventories increased 0.8 percent in January, matching December\u2019s gain. Though the strong inventory build suggests demand is slowing it lifted GDP forecasts for the first quarter. MANUFACTURING STABILIZING\n\u201cConsumption, however, is likely to remain weak, and the inventory build is getting ominous,\u201d said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York.\nGoldman Sachs raised its first-quarter GDP estimate by four-tenths of a percentage point to a 1.2 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent rate in the October-December quarter. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.\nWhile demand is softening, the supply side of the economy is stabilizing. In a fourth report on Monday, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to a reading of 55.3 in March from 54.2 in February, which had marked the lowest level since November 2016.\nThe reading was slightly above expectations of 54.5 from a Reuters poll of 69 economists. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.\nThe ISM said 16 industries, including machinery, computer and electronic products, furniture, and electrical equipment, appliances and components, reported growth last month. Apparel and paper products industries reported a contraction.\nManufactures in the computer and electronic products industry said the sector \u201cseems to be slowly coming out of crisis mode.\u201d Chemical producers said \u201cBrexit continues to be a concern, despite the fact that our organization has already rolled out a plan to minimize its impact.\u201d\nThe ISM\u2019s new orders sub-index increased to a reading of 57.4 last month from 55.5 in February. But a measure of export orders fell, likely reflecting softening global economic growth.\nFactories reported hiring more workers last month, with a measure of manufacturing employment racing to a reading of 57.5 from 52.3 in February. That bodes well for a rebound in job growth in March after hiring almost stalled in February. March\u2019s employment report is scheduled for release on Friday.\n\u201cOverall we think that things are stabilizing following the earlier deterioration rather than intensifying,\u201d said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.\nReporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and may not reflect those of Kitco Metals Inc.

Under the agreement, Tesla will take specific steps to properly manage hazardous wastes at its factory. Tesla will also purchase $55,000 in emergency response equipment for the City of Fremont Fire Department and pay a $31,000 penalty.\n\u201cIt's vital that businesses comply with hazardous waste laws that keep facilities safe for workers and the community,\u201d said EPA Pacific Southwest Regional Administrator Mike Stoker. \u201cWe are pleased that this settlement will bring much needed emergency response equipment to the City of Fremont.\u201d\nAs a result of the inspections, EPA determined that Tesla: failed to comply with air emissions standards for equipment leaks; failed to comply with management requirements for generators of hazardous wastes; and failed to make an adequate hazardous waste determination for certain solid waste generated at the facility.\nIn addition to paying the $31,000 penalty, Tesla is required to complete a supplemental environmental project to purchase and provide at least $55,000 worth of emergency response equipment for the City of Fremont Fire Department. This equipment will improve the department\u2019s ability to respond to hazardous materials incidents. The company has since addressed all the identified violations and has come into compliance with RCRA requirements. Tesla also delivered hazardous waste training to over 1,100 paint shop associates, technicians and supervisors at its facility.\nEPA led unannounced inspections at the Fremont facility in 2017 along with the California Department of Toxic Substances Control and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. The inspections identified violations of federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations. RCRA rules require the safe management of hazardous waste to protect public health and the environment and to prevent costly cleanups. The settlement is part of the EPA\u2019s National Compliance initiative to reduce hazardous air emissions at hazardous waste facilities.\nFor more information about the National Compliance initiative, please visit: https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/national-compliance-initiative-reducing-hazardous-air-emissions-hazardous-waste\nFor more information on RCRA, please visit: www.epa.gov/rcra # # # Contact Us to ask a question, provide feedback, or report a problem.

The grant runs for three years, through September 2021.\nThe funds are part of a performance partnership grant (PPG), which are given to states to help implement environmental programs that they have authority to run. Through this grant, NHDES will administer environmental programs for air, water and waste with flexibility to direct resources where they are most needed to address environmental and public health priorities.\n\"This grant gives New Hampshire the capacity to advance its work on a range of priority environmental issues across the state,\" said EPA New England acting Regional Administrator Deb Szaro. \"EPA is committed to providing funding to states across New England to enable them to deliver critical environmental and public health safeguards for residents and local communities.\"\nFunding will help protect citizens and the environment in New Hampshire by supporting the state's effort to reduce air and water pollution, improve waste management and promote pollution prevention and sustainable practices. NHDES will use a portion of the funding on public drinking water maintenance and supervision as well as and public beach protection.\nPPGs are important tools that allow EPA to provide financial assistance to states and tribes.

We have not reached any agreement with CFIUS as of the day of the announcement. We will disclose any future development,\u201d Kunlun said in a brief filing with the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission.\nThe development represents a rare high-profile example of CFIUS seeking to undo an acquisition that has already been completed. Kunlun took over Grindr through two separate deals between 2016 and 2018 without submitting the acquisition for CFIUS review, making it vulnerable to such an intervention, Reuters reported last week.\nCFIUS has not disclosed its specific concerns. However, the United States has been increasingly scrutinizing app developers over the safety of personal data, especially if some of it involves U.S. military or intelligence personnel.\nGrindr collects personal information submitted by users, including location, messages, and in some cases even someone\u2019s HIV status, according to its privacy policy.\nKunlun said last August it was preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) of Grindr.\nAs a result of CFIUS\u2019 intervention, Kunlun has shifted its focus to an auction process to sell Grindr outright, given that the IPO would have kept Grindr under Kunlun\u2019s control for longer, Reuters reported.\nKunlun\u2019s control of Grindr has fueled concerns among privacy advocates in the United States. U.S. Senators Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal sent a letter to Grindr last year demanding answers about how the app would protect users\u2019 privacy under its Chinese owner.\nKunlun is one of China\u2019s largest mobile gaming companies. It was part of a buyout consortium that acquired Norwegian internet browser business Opera Ltd for $600 million in 2016.\nFounded in 2008 by Tsinghua University graduate Zhou Yahui, Kunlun also owns Qudian Inc, a Chinese consumer credit provider, and Xianlai Huyu, a Chinese mobile gaming company.\nZhou has said that the overseas market is the root of Kunlun\u2019s business, accounting for 70 percent of Kunlun\u2019s revenue.\nReporting by Echo Wang in New York; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and may not reflect those of Kitco Metals Inc.

Filed Under: \" Avengers: Endgame \" With Avengers: Endgame fast approaching, the reveals keep on coming and we now have one final batch of S.H. Figuarts action figures for you to take a look at. This morning, we brought you new looks at characters like Ant-Man, Black Widow, and War Machine as well as Captain America, Iron Man, and Ronin . Now, it's time to focus on the villainous Mad Titan! His armour (which we know is currently resembling a scarecrow on Thanos' new home) looks downright badass, as does that sword he's wielding...which you have to believe is perfectly balanced. Also in the gallery below, you'll find some very cool additional shots of Iron Man and his unique new weaponry. It appears as if he'll start off by wearing a suit similar to what we saw in Avengers: Infinity War before moving on to one which is a little more comic accurate and featured in most marketing materials and merchandise. We'll have to wait and see how that's handled in the movie itself (there's not long to go now) but in the meantime, you just have to click on the \"View List\" button to see these new action figures.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "iron man", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ant-man", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "s.h. figuarts action figures focus on thanos", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T00:28:28.033+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "49d60a1062e58e1d5b18ded6773d8b6512c0245a", "url": "https://www.tovima.gr/2019/04/02/%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%b1%ce%be%ce%b9%ce%bd%cf%8c%ce%bc%ce%b7%cf%84%ce%b1/us-freezes-delivery-of-f-35-fighter-equipment-for-erdogan-to-back-down-on-s-400s/", "site_full": "www.tovima.gr", "site": "tovima.gr", "site_section": "http://www.tovima.gr/feed/allnews", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "\u0395\u03b9\u03b4\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u2013 \u03bd\u03ad\u03b1 \u2013 \u03a4\u03bf \u0392\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1 Online", "title": "US freezes delivery of F-35 fighter equipment for Erdogan to back down on S-400s", "title_full": "US freezes delivery of F-35 fighter equipment for Erdogan to back down on S-400s", "published": "2019-04-02T00:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.tovima.gr/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/01/trumpster1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7172, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "49d60a1062e58e1d5b18ded6773d8b6512c0245a", "url": "https://www.tovima.gr/2019/04/02/%ce%b1%cf%84%ce%b1%ce%be%ce%b9%ce%bd%cf%8c%ce%bc%ce%b7%cf%84%ce%b1/us-freezes-delivery-of-f-35-fighter-equipment-for-erdogan-to-back-down-on-s-400s/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ggilson", "published": "2019-04-02T00:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "US freezes delivery of F-35 fighter equipment for Erdogan to back down on S-400s", "text": "US freezes delivery of F-35 fighter equipment for Erdogan to back down on S-400s \u03a4\u03bf\u0392\u0397\u039c\u0391 Team | 02.04.2019 - 00:27 FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan gesture as they talk at the start of the NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium July 11, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo\nThe United States has halted delivery of equipment related to the stealthy F-35 fighter aircraft to Turkey, a Pentagon spokesman said on 1 April, marking the first concrete U.S. step to block delivery of the jet to the NATO ally in light of Ankara\u2019s planned purchase of a Russian missile defense system.\nIn recent days, U.S. officials told their Turkish counterparts they will not receive further shipments of F-35 related equipment needed to prepare for the arrival of the stealthy jet, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday.\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan has refused to back down from Ankara\u2019s planned purchase of a Russian S-400 missile defense system that the United States has said would compromise the security of F-35 aircraft.\n\u201cPending an unequivocal Turkish decision to forgo delivery of the S-400, deliveries and activities associated with the stand-up of Turkey\u2019s F-35 operational capability have been suspended,\u201d Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Mike Andrews, a Defense Department spokesman, said in a statement.\nTurkey has said it will take delivery of the S-400s in July.\nThe sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the next shipment of training equipment, and all subsequent shipments of F-35 related material, had been canceled. The aircraft is built by Lockheed Martin Corp. The disagreement over the F-35 is the latest of a series of diplomatic disputes between the United States and Turkey including Turkish demands that the United States extradite Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, differences over Middle East policy and the war in Syria, and sanctions on Iran.\nA Pentagon official had told Reuters in March that the United States had a number of items it could withhold in order to send Turkey a signal that the United States was serious about Ankara dropping its ambition to own the S-400. Turkish officials in Ankara were not immediately available for comment.\nNato summit\nThe U.S. decision on the F-35s was expected to complicate Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu\u2019s planned visit to Washington this week for a NATO summit. The latest development in the F-35 dispute came a day after Erdogan suffered one of his biggest electoral losses in decades in local elections.\nReuters reported last week that Washington was exploring whether it could remove Turkey from production of the F-35. Turkey makes parts of the fuselage, landing gear and cockpit displays. Sources familiar with the F-35\u2019s intricate worldwide production process and U.S. thinking on the issue last week said Turkey\u2019s role can be replaced.\nThe United States and other NATO allies that own F-35s fear the radar on the Russian S-400 missile system will learn how to spot and track the jet, making it less able to evade Russian weapons in the future.\nIn an attempt to persuade Turkey to drop its plans to buy the S-400, the United States offered the pricier American-made Patriot anti-missile system in a discounted deal that expired at the end of March. Turkey has shown interest in the Patriot system, but not at the expense of abandoning the S-400.\nTurkey has engaged with U.S. negotiators in recent days about buying the Patriot system, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The system is made by Raytheon Co.\nTurkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar in March said that despite some issues, Turkish pilots were continuing their training at an air base in Arizona on the F-35, each of which costs $90 million, and that Ankara was expecting the aircraft to arrive in Turkey in November.\nU.S. lawmakers also have expressed alarm over Turkey\u2019s planned purchase of the Russian system. Four U.S. senators last week introduced a bipartisan bill that would prohibit the transfer of F-35s to Turkey until the U.S. government certifies that Ankara will not take delivery of the S-400 system. \u0394\u03b5\u03af\u03c4\u03b5 \u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "erdogan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T00:30:49.044+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "765124bbe806278fbedc1130b75dfc57070cd2f9", "url": "https://wkkj.iheart.com/content/2019-04-01-hundreds-in-south-bloomfield-without-power-after-tanker-crash-on-us-23/", "site_full": "wkkj.iheart.com", "site": "iheart.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "Hundreds in South Bloomfield Without Power After Tanker Crash on U.S. 23 | 1490 WBEX", "title_full": "Hundreds in South Bloomfield Without Power After Tanker Crash on U.S. 23 | 1490 WBEX", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5ca270517baeaadd4cb7a1d3", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1524, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "765124bbe806278fbedc1130b75dfc57070cd2f9", "url": "https://wkkj.iheart.com/content/2019-04-01-hundreds-in-south-bloomfield-without-power-after-tanker-crash-on-us-23/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Hundreds in South Bloomfield Without Power After Tanker Crash on U.S. 23 | 1490 WBEX", "text": "Hundreds in South Bloomfield Without Power After Tanker Crash on U.S. 23 Apr 1, 2019\nThe Pickaway County Sheriff's Office reporting a traffic accident in South Bloomfield.\n-\nAccording to the office, a tanker truck crashed into a building at Main St. and U.S. 23, bringing down power lines and utility poles.

This is in retaliation for the tens of thousands of migrants leaving those countries each month for the U.S. White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney went on CNN yesterday to defend the move.\n(SOUNDBITE OF CNN BROADCAST)\nMICK MULVANEY: The people say it's working, but the proof is in the numbers. It's not working well enough to help us solve our border crisis, and that's what the president is focused on.\nCHANG: In a moment, we will hear from the U.S.-Mexico border. But first, let's focus on the hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance that could be at stake here. El Salvador's ambassador to the U.S. joins us now.\nClaudia Canjura, welcome.\nCLAUDIA IVETTE CANJURA DE CENTENO: Hello. Good afternoon. Thank you.\nCHANG: So have you heard directly from anyone in the Trump administration about this move? Did you get any warning, any guidance about it?\nCANJURA: You know, we - as government of El Salvador, we haven't received an official announcement from the government of...\nCHANG: Really?\nCANJURA: ...The U.S. regarding the cancellation of the economic aid for our country and for the Northern Triangle. So as - you - all we know - our country has made significant progress and - if the - each of the areas establishing the Northern Triangle prosperity plan. So we are confident that the cooperation that the people of the United States gives to our country will be maintained for the region.\nCHANG: Well, now President Trump is threatening to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance. What would that mean to El Salvador, to lose that money? How do you currently use those funds now?\nCANJURA: You know, that money - that money isn't managed directly for our government. That money is managed and administrated by different companies, enterprise - enterprises, NGOs that work in the government - that work...\nCHANG: And how do they spend the money?\nCANJURA: ...In our country. They spend the money in different programs of cooperation that are related to safety, to youth empowerment, to security, you know, that has to be with the creating better conditions of living in our country in terms of improving the conditions for our young people, creating jobs, creating great opportunities, developing spaces of recreation for our people. So it's a very important cooperation for our countries. But we don't manage the money, as government.\nCHANG: OK. Now, Mick Mulvaney, the president's chief of staff - he said yesterday that, quote, \"El Salvador could do more.\" What do you make of that pushback? What do you think your country could do to help slow down migration into the U.S.?\nCANJURA: What - what I can do is that we are making all our efforts - we're doing the best in terms of decrease in the movements of irregular migration. El Salvador is one of the countries in the region that has decreased it more than 60 percent, the arrivals at the north - at the southern border...\nCHANG: Right. But the Trump administration wants to see your country do more. Is there anything you can offer?\nCANJURA: We are working. You know, one of this - this weekend, this just past - last weekend, a codel, a delegation from congressman and congresswoman from the U.S., went to our country. And they could witness all the performance that the - the U.S.-El Salvador cooperation programs has and how they impact in appropriate way in - in our community. So they could see the performance and how we are doing the best that we can at all the levels - at the local levels with all our governments - with all our local governments in terms of improving the conditions.\nCHANG: Ambassador Claudia Canjura of El Salvador, thank you very much for joining us today.\nCANJURA: Thank you.

So I leave an open invitation if anyone wants to followup with the investor relations line if they have questions.\nAgain there are no disagreements, just some extra work that they've asked us for that we anticipate clearing up in the next 24 hours or so, we've left us till Thursday just to be, to air on the side of infinite caution we don\u2019t imagine we'll have any snags reporting by then.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo More By Ginger Gibson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders is against expanding the nine-member Supreme Court, a proposal some liberal activists have advocated to effectively reverse President Donald Trump's appointment of conservative judges. \"My worry is that the next time the Republicans are in power they will do the same thing, I think that is not the ultimate solution,\" Sanders said in response to a question at a forum on Monday organized by public employee unions and other liberal groups. Sanders said he would consider proposals that created term limits for Supreme Court justices or would rotate judges between the highest court and the lower-level appeals courts. Trump has also ruled out expanding the number of judges ahead of the election. Trump appointed conservative Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch to the court since taking office in 2017, cementing its 5-4 conservative majority. Supreme Court justices are appointed for lifetime terms, and both his appointees potentially could serve for decades. In response to Trump's appointments, a handful of liberal activists have argued that if Democrats win the White House in the November 2020 presidential election, they should expand the number of Supreme Court justices to tip the balance of control toward liberals. When asked, some candidates seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination have said they would consider adding more justices to the court or other reforms. However, they have not made it a central part of their policy proposals, and other Democrats have opposed such an idea. Long-shot liberal candidate Pete Buttigieg has mentioned a Supreme Court composed of 15 justices coupled with other reforms that would ensure partisan parity. When Trump was elected in 2016, there was a court vacancy because of the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia and the Republican-led Senate's refusal to consider Democratic President Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland. Some Democrats have accused Republicans of \"stealing\" a seat, pointing to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's move to block consideration of Garland and keep the position vacant until the following year so the next president could make the appointment. McConnell's action, with little precedent in U.S. history, enabled Trump to nominate Gorsuch in 2017, with the Republican-led Senate voting to confirm him. Expanding the court - by either party - would be difficult. Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt in 1937 proposed expanding it to as many as 15 justices. Critics accused him of a \"court-packing\" scheme aimed at changing its ideological composition. The proposal went nowhere in Congress.

Investors unimpressed by the terms pushed the stock 8.1% lower to end the session. So what Puma's only drug, Nerlynx, earned FDA approval in July 2017, but European regulators didn't approve the treatment until last September. In the U.S., fourth-quarter sales of the drug more than tripled compared to the previous year, to $61.1 million. Less than this amount for European rights was more than some Puma investors could live with. Man wearing a loose tie and a rumpled shirt holds a downward-sloping arrow. More Image source: Getty Images. Nerlynx is an extended adjuvant treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer patients following treatment with Herceptin, which is standard care for this group. When Puma announced a commercialization partnership with the French pharmaceutical company Pierre Fabre, investors weren't impressed with an up-front payment of just $60 million, milestone payments that could reach $345 million, and double-digit royalties on Nerlynx sales throughout Europe. Now what Puma investors need to remember that in the U.S., Nerlynx has a $10,500-per-month list price. European governments on a budget are highly unlikely to pay anything near that amount for a long-term treatment, even if it does prevent tumors from coming back. It's a little embarrassing that Pierre Fabre wasn't willing to take a big chance with Nerlynx, but this isn't such an awful deal for Puma. Trying to launch a new cancer drug in the EU requires separate deals with each government payer. They all play by their own rules, and letting Pierre Fabre handle the commercialization and development in that region will save a bundle on consulting fees.

Here I'd like to go over why ON Semiconductor wants to buy Quantenna and how the deal will affect ON Semiconductor once it has closed. A man and a woman handing stacks of $100 bills to the viewer. More Image source: Getty Images. Broadening ON Semiconductor's horizons ON Semiconductor explained in a presentation going over the details of this deal that Quantenna's Wi-Fi chip expertise and software chops would serve to complement the former's preexisting Bluetooth and power management products. Put simply, ON Semiconductor expects that the addition of Quantenna to its business portfolio will expand the former's served addressable market (SAM) by $4.3 billion by 2022. And, to boot, ON Semiconductor claims that Quantenna's business has \"minimal overlap in end-markets and consumers,\" so ON Semiconductor isn't really paying for much that it already had in house. Now, to be fair, while ON Semiconductor talked up the large SAM expansion, keep in mind that Quantenna's revenue in 2018 was just shy of $221 million -- up 25% from the prior year. So while adding Quantenna to the portfolio allows ON Semiconductor to go after a much larger opportunity, it'll still need to work to capture a bigger slice of it. For some context, ON Semiconductor itself generated $5.88 billion in revenue in 2018, so the addition of Quantenna's revenue isn't going to have a profound impact on ON Semiconductor's overall financial results in the near term. Let's talk numbers It's worth noting that although ON Semiconductor's and Quantenna's businesses don't really overlap, the former has signaled to investors that there will be some cost synergies associated with the transaction. In particular, ON Semiconductor says that there will be $26 million of \"annual operational synergies run rate within one year of close\" and that the source of those synergies will be in both cost of goods sold (COGS) and \"general and administrative functions.\" Considering that Quantenna's total operating expenses were about $106.6 million in 2018, that $26 million in \"operational synergies\" is actually quite significant and should dramatically increase the company's operating income, which was just $2.81 million in 2018. And the good news is that the cost reductions don't appear to be affecting the company's research and development spending -- the fuel that powers the development of future technologies and products. The deal, ON Semiconductor says, will be \"immediately accretive to non- GAAP [generally accepted accounting principles] earnings and free cash flow.\" What this means is that once the deal has closed and Quantenna's financial results become part of ON Semiconductor's, the latter will see a boost in both non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) and free cash flow . Investor takeaway Ultimately, ON Semiconductor's strategic rationale behind this deal looks sound. ON Semiconductor isn't getting a screaming bargain at the proposed purchase price, which is about 22 times what analysts expect Quantenna's EPS to be in 2020. However, if Quantenna continues to grow rapidly and if the cost synergies that ON Semiconductor expects to achieve actually happen, then the price ON Semiconductor is paying will probably, in hindsight, seem quite fair. Now, one thing that might be frustrating to some Quantenna shareholders is that the company's shares, during their relatively brief time on the public markets (Quantenna's IPO happened in late 2016), actually traded briefly above the $24.50 purchase price about two years ago. So any shareholders who actually paid more than $24.50 for the stock and held on might not even walk away with a profit. Nevertheless, with a price of $24.50, most shareholders are probably going to walk away with profits as a result of this acquisition, and those who bought at Quantenna's actual peak will see their losses minimized, so this looks like a pretty good deal all around.

The U.S. has reportedly ceased F-35 equipment shipments to Turkey. George Frey/Getty Images\nThe U.S. has paused all deliveries to Turkey of equipment related to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter as retribution for its continued plans to invest in a sophisticated Russian missile system.\nThe news represents a dramatic downturn in already deteriorating relations between the U.S. and Turkey following months of policies under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that have brought the NATO ally into closer cooperation with Russia. RELATED CONTENT Turkey Barreling Toward Clash with U.S.\nSources told Reuters , among the first outlets to report the news, that American officials had relayed to their Turkish counterparts in recent days that they would cease the F-35 equipment shipments if Ankara proceeded with a long-discussed deal to purchase Russian S-400 surface-to-air missiles. Erdogan has previously pledged that Turkey would begin receiving the missile system in July.\n\"The United States has been clear that Turkey's acquisition of the S-400 is unacceptable. Therefore, the DoD has initiated steps necessary to ensure prudent program planning and resiliency of the F-35 supply chain. Secondary sources of supply for Turkish-produced parts are now in development,\" Pentagon spokesman Charles Summers said in a statement. \"We very much regret the current situation facing our F-35 partnership with Turkey, and the DoD is taking prudent steps to protect the shared investments made in our critical technology. Our important dialogue on this matter will continue, however, until they forgo delivery of the S-400, the United States has suspended deliveries and activities associated with the stand-up of Turkey's F-35 operational capability. Should Turkey procure the S-400, their continued participation in the F-35 program is at risk.\"\nAmerican officials, including Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan and prominent members of Congress, have expressed concern that one country operating both of those weapons platforms would give Moscow insight into the sensitive inner workings of the highly technical F-35. The U.S. and many of its allies and partners plan for the controversial, uniquely expensive fighter jet to become a central feature of their air forces.\n\"Though Turkey is an important U.S. ally, their close relationship with Putin and persistent efforts to acquire the Russian S-400 air defense system could seriously compromise our national security,\" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said in a statement. The New Hampshire Democrat has introduced a bill with bipartisan support that would solidify the delay of transferring F-35s \u2013 not just equipment related to them \u2013 to Turkey until it fully abandons its plans to proceed with the Russian missile sale. [ The Week in Cartoons for April 1-5 ]\nTurkey currently has two-F35s on which its pilots and crews are training at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. The U.S. had previously scheduled to deliver to Turkey two more by November of this year. Under the previously arranged deal, the jets were to be delivered to Turkey within one or two years.\nFollowing increased cooperation with Russia for regional policies such as the war in Syria, Erdogan, who continues to face criticism for perceived authoritarian crackdowns at home, pledged to purchase the S-400s. In recent weeks, he has doubled down on his intentions and stated Turkey may even invest in other, more sophisticated Russian equipment.\n\"The S-400 is a done deal, there can be no turning back. We have reached an agreement with the Russians,\" Erdogan told Turkey's Kanal 24 television station last month . \"We will move toward a joint production. Perhaps after the S-400, we will go for the S-500.\"\nIn regional elections over the weekend, Erdogan's party lost control of the capital, Ankara , in a surprise outcome, leading some to speculate that his recent consolidations of power are beginning to backfire.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo Reuters\nBy Ginger Gibson\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders is against expanding the nine-member Supreme Court, a proposal some liberal activists have advocated to effectively reverse President Donald Trump's appointment of conservative judges.\n\"My worry is that the next time the Republicans are in power they will do the same thing, I think that is not the ultimate solution,\" Sanders said in response to a question at a forum on Monday organized by public employee unions and other liberal groups.\nSanders said he would consider proposals that created term limits for Supreme Court justices or would rotate judges between the highest court and the lower-level appeals courts.\nTrump has also ruled out expanding the number of judges ahead of the election.\nTrump appointed conservative Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch to the court since taking office in 2017, cementing its 5-4 conservative majority. Supreme Court justices are appointed for lifetime terms, and both his appointees potentially could serve for decades.\nIn response to Trump's appointments, a handful of liberal activists have argued that if Democrats win the White House in the November 2020 presidential election, they should expand the number of Supreme Court justices to tip the balance of control toward liberals.\nWhen asked, some candidates seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination have said they would consider adding more justices to the court or other reforms. However, they have not made it a central part of their policy proposals, and other Democrats have opposed such an idea.\nLong-shot liberal candidate Pete Buttigieg has mentioned a Supreme Court composed of 15 justices coupled with other reforms that would ensure partisan parity.\nWhen Trump was elected in 2016, there was a court vacancy because of the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia and the Republican-led Senate's refusal to consider Democratic President Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland.\nSome Democrats have accused Republicans of \"stealing\" a seat, pointing to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's move to block consideration of Garland and keep the position vacant until the following year so the next president could make the appointment.

Duncan's Wicked Saints did not disappoint my fantasy-loving heart. Tossed into chaos from page one, Nadya is a cleric and has been kept a secret for most of her life. She has a brilliant power, a power that can one day change the world. She can speak to the gods. When her home, the monastery is under attack, Nadya must flee for her life. While on the run she encounters rebels including Malachiaz, and together they begin to plan to kill the king. But soon Nadya realizes that those around her are not what they seem.While I enjoyed most of the book, I was slightly let down by the characters. Nadya was not my favorite, but that could be due to her being the main character and slipping into a side character role. The story was much more focused on the men in the story which was a bit frustrating at times. Nadya still remains a strong character in my eyes, I just wish she wasn't easily swayed. And as for Serefin, I really enjoyed his character. I thought he had a brilliant character arc and fantastic growth.While some of the plots got confusing and some plots didn't feel wrapped up, I still very much enjoyed the book. The ending was a bit predictable but overall still really fantastic. I seriously cannot wait to learn more about this dark twisted world.But I do highly recommend reading this book. I think if you enjoy blood, war, politics, and religion then definitely give this a go. Enemies to lovers plus magic? Who doesn't want to read that!

Republicans, Chamber of Commerce question president&apos;s latest threat", "text": "Trump border closing? Republicans, Chamber of Commerce question president's latest threat John Fritze and Eliza Collins WASHINGTON \u2013 Border-state Republicans and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce balked Monday at President Donald Trump's latest threat to close the U.S.-Mexico border , arguing the move would damage the nation's economy. Frustrated by an influx of migrant families arriving from Central America , Trump has ratcheted up his rhetoric on sealing the border, threatening that his administration could close ports as early as this week if Mexico doesn't do more to stem the flow of arrivals. But a number of Republicans representing border states urged caution, noting Mexico was the nation's third-largest trading partner last year. Others, including Republican leaders, stayed quiet as they sought to assess the seriousness of Trump's threat, which he has made previously without following through. \"The president made that statement out of frustration. I don't think he's going to actually shut off the border,\" Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told a forum in Washington on Monday. \"It would have a significant impact on our economy,\" he added. \"I understand the president\u2019s frustration, but the unintended consequences of that, I think, would be bad for everybody,\" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. Several Republicans on Capitol Hill didn\u2019t seem to see the president\u2019s threat as something immediate and instead focused on the need to deal with immigration. \u201cWhat do you mean, shut it down?\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., responded when asked about Trump's threat. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment Monday. Illegal immigration remains lower than it was during the 1990s and 2000s, when Border Patrol agents regularly apprehended more than 1 million undocumented immigrants a year at the southern border. But the administration has pointed to a spike in Central American families making the journey north. In February, Border Patrol agents apprehended 66,450 people illegally crossing the southern border. A record high 36,174 of those (54%) were members of families and 6,825 (10%) were unaccompanied minors, according to Border Patrol data . Speaking to reporters Friday, Trump said there is a \"very good likelihood that I\u2019ll be closing the border next week\" to address the issue. White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday that the administration would need to see \"something dramatic\" to hold short of sealing the U.S. Mexico-border. The idea has drawn tepid a response from some within Trump's party. \"It's my view that we've got to keep the legitimate trade and travel and cross-border commerce happening at the ports entry while we also need to secure our border and address this crisis,\" Sen. Martha McSally, R-Arizona, told reporters Monday. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., wouldn't directly say whether he would support closing the border. \"What the president seems to be doing right now is trying to work with Mexico and with Central America, and say, 'If we don\u2019t find a way to work together to stop this, then I\u2019m going to have to find a way that\u2019s a blunt object to do it,'\" Lankford said. At least one Democrat said the threat of border closure was real. \u201cI think you\u2019ve gotta take him seriously,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also weighed in Monday, urging the administration to consider the costs to domestic exporters. The leading business organization said it shared the administration's concern about a \"massive influx of migrants\" but said the best response is for Congress to attempt a broader overhaul of immigration law. Mexico must use its very strong immigration laws to stop the many thousands of people trying to get into the USA. Our detention areas are maxed out & we will take no more illegals. Next step is to close the Border! This will also help us with stopping the Drug flow from Mexico! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2019 \"Even threatening to close the border to legitimate commerce and travel creates a degree of economic uncertainty that risks compromising the very gains in growth and productivity that policies of the Trump administration have helped achieve,\u201d said Neil Bradley, the group's executive vice president and chief policy officer. The Commerce Department estimates $502 billion in goods crossed the border in trucks and trains last year, roughly $1.4 billion a day. That doesn't include products shipped by air and sea. Administration officials have said the border has reached its \"breaking point,\" forcing Customs and Border Protection to use extreme measures to keep up. One of those changes has been to start releasing migrants into the streets of border communities, breaking with the administration's practice of detaining them as long as possible. Trump's proposal has met with support from some Republicans, while many others have not commented. Some Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, initially advised Trump against declaring an emergency at the border to free up federal funding for the wall, but then backed the move once Trump acted. \"Well, I mean, what are we supposed to do?\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a Trump ally told \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"So if the president feels like that the only way to control this problem is to move the people from the port of entry to the ungoverned spaces where we need a wall, I will support him. I hope we don't have to do that.\" Trump threatened to close the border several times last year, but the administration did not follow through on the threat. \"Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants, many of whom are stone cold criminals, back to their countries,\" Trump tweeted in late November. \"We will close the Border permanently if need be.\" President Trump arrives to speak at a rally.

Ellis reportedly dismissed", "text": "Ethics complaints against T.S. Ellis, the federal judge who gained a reputation for his harshness toward special counsel Robert Mueller's prosecutors in the trial of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, have been dismissed, according to a new report.\nThe order from Judge Roger Gregory of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit quashes complaints lodged by four unnamed people who slammed Ellis' conduct in Manafort's trial as \"embarrassing\" and perhaps indicative of \"early onset dementia,\" according to a report Monday from BuzzFeed News .\nA source familiar with the matter told BuzzFeed that the complaints were lodged against Ellis, who is not named in the order published by the news outlet.\n\"Considering the district judge's remarks in their overall context, the record does not support the conclusion that the district judge engaged in misconduct,\" Gregory wrote in his order, which appears to have been filed Friday.\n\"The complainants have also failed to present, and the records do not disclose, any evidence of willful indifference to prevailing law or other misconduct,\" Gregory wrote. \"The record does not support the existence of an improper influence upon the judge, mental disability, or 'early onset dementia.'\"\nEllis, 78, gained extra media attention during the high-profile trial for his brusque, impatient style of addressing prosecutors on Mueller's team. He repeatedly urged prosecutors to hurry up with their arguments and admonished them for highlighting multiple examples of Manafort's expensive tastes.\nManafort is \"not on trial for having a lavish lifestyle,\" Ellis said at one point early in the trial . \"To parade all of this seems to me unnecessary, irrelevant and maybe unfairly prejudicial.\"\nOn another occasion, prosecutors filed a motion during the trial, saying that one of Ellis' outbursts against them could potentially prejudice the jury against them. Ellis apologized and instructed the jury to ignore his criticism.\nBefore the trial had even begun, Ellis accused prosecutors of lodging the charges against Manafort merely to pressure him into cooperating with Mueller's probe of Russian interference and possible Trump-campaign collusion during the 2016 election.\n\"You don't really care about Mr. Manafort's bank fraud,\" Ellis said at a hearing in May. \"You really care about what information he might give you about Mr. Trump and what might lead to his impeachment or prosecution.\"\nManafort, 70, served as then-candidate Donald Trump's top campaign aide for several months in 2016. He was charged in two separate federal court districts by Mueller's grand jury, on charges that mostly pertained to work he performed years before joining Trump's campaign, as a political consultant for a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine.\nEllis presided over Manafort's trial in Alexandria, Va., district court in August. Manafort was convicted in that trial on eight criminal counts including tax fraud, bank fraud and failing to file a foreign bank account report. Ten other counts were deadlocked by the 12-member jury.\nManafort was sentenced in March to serve 47 months in federal prison \u2014 a much lighter sentence than federal sentencing guidelines called for. Ellis, who had already been criticized for his conduct during the trial, drew further ire from Mueller's supporters by saying that Manafort \"has lived an otherwise blameless life.\"\nManafort was sentenced to 43 additional months in his second case in Washington, D.C., federal court. Manafort's combined sentences will keep him behind bars for up to 7\u00bd years.\nA spokesman for the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, declined to comment on BuzzFeed's report. A spokesperson for the Fourth Circuit Appeals Court was unavailable to comment on the report because that building was flooded, a respondent told CNBC.\nThe four anonymous individuals tore into Ellis in their complaints accusing him of misconduct, according to BuzzFeed.\n\"Losing temper, or attacking motivations of officers of the court is not acceptable, particularly for federal judiciary,\" one complainant said.\nAnother complainant went much further, asserting that the judge's comments \"were demonstrably intended to embarrass either the witness for the government or the prosecutors in the case. In so doing, he inappropriately tilts the scales of justice against the prosecution and in favor of the defendant in the eyes of the jury.\"\nThat complaint added that either the judge \"has early onset dementia or he fails to understand his role as ... an impartial arbiter.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-04/manafort-judge-questions-if-mueller-overstepped-his-authority&quot;", "https://www.scribd.com/document/403993620/3-29-19-Order-Ellis-Complaints&quot;", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-04/manafort-judge-questions-if-mueller-overstepped-his-authority", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/02/paul-manafort-not-on-trial-for-lavish-spending-judge-warns.html", "https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zoetillman/paul-manafort-judge-no-disciplinary-action-mueller", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/02/paul-manafort-not-on-trial-for-lavish-spending-judge-warns.html&quot;", "https://www.scribd.com/document/403993620/3-29-19-Order-Ellis-Complaints", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/04/judge-in-paul-manafort-case-criticizes-robert-mueller-probe.html", "https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zoetillman/paul-manafort-judge-no-disciplinary-action-mueller&quot;", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/04/judge-in-paul-manafort-case-criticizes-robert-mueller-probe.html&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul manafort", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "t.s. ellis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ellis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manafort", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gregory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger gregory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. court of appeals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buzzfeed news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fourth circuit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T00:52:36.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "44bf84f24b4e25fa702381c6478f08cc1783c9db", "url": "https://www.dealsplus.com/Women_deals/p_s-l-fashions-short-sleeve-floral-sheath-dress", "site_full": "www.dealsplus.com", "site": "dealsplus.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/dealspl/all", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "DealsPlus: all deals", "title": "S.

Ashwin provided Punjab with the first breakthrough to peg Delhi back.\nShreyas Iyer who came into bat at number three, along with Shikhar Dhawan steadied the innings for Delhi as both these batsman stitched together a partnership of 61 runs taking the team out of trouble.\nHardus Viljoen provided the much-needed breakthrough for Punjab as he finally shattered the stumps of Delhi's captain Iyer, dismissing him for 28 runs in the eighth over of the innings.\nRishabh Pant after coming out to bat at number four once again started to play in his trademark style and disrupted the bowler's line and length with some audacious shots. But Ashwin once again proved to be a game changer for Punjab as he trapped Dhawan right in the middle, dismissing him for 30 runs reducing Delhi to 83 for the loss of three wickets at the halfway mark.\nColin Ingram along with Pant steadied the innings and both of these batsmen perfectly mixed caution with aggression bringing the asking rate down and taking Delhi to a comfortable position in the chase.\nIngram and Pant stitched together a partnership of 62 runs taking Delhi closer to the victory. However, the two back-to-back wickets in the 17th over of the innings gave Punjab an outside chance to make a comeback in the match. Pant (39) was dismissed by Mohammad Shami whereas Chris Morris (0) was run out by Ashwin as he displayed an impressive fielding move.\nDelhi was further pegged back as they lost they both Ingram (38) and Harshal Patel (0) in the 18th over as Sam Curran delivered an outstanding over.\nWith 19 required off the final two overs, the task proved too much for the tailenders of Delhi and they succumbed under pressure losing the match by 14 runs. Delhi Capitals went from 144 for three to 152 all out registering a mammoth collapse. Sam Curran was the hero for Punjab as he took four wickets, registering the first hat-trick of this season of IPL.\nEarlier, David Miller and Sarfaraz Khan's knocks of 43 and 39 respectively enabled the Punjab team to post 166 runs on the board for the loss of nine wickets after being put into bat.\nKings XI Punjab got off to the worst start possible as they lost their in-form opener KL Rahul for just 15 runs in the second over of the innings. Chris Morris provided the first breakthrough for Delhi.\nThe opener Curran provided the Punjab team with some lusty boundaries inside the first six overs, but he failed to read the ball out of Sandeep Lamichhane hands and was adjudged LBW after scoring 20 runs.\nDespite losing three wickets quickly, Punjab did not allow the game to move at a snail's pace as both Sarfaraz Khan and David Miller played some audacious shots to keep the runs flowing for the team.\nSarfaraz and Miller stitched together a partnership of 62 runs to take the team out of troubled waters after being reduced to 58 for three. But, Lamichhane once again proved his mettle as he provided the crucial breakthrough for Delhi after dismissing Sarfaraz for 39 runs.\nDelhi was able to bounce back in the match as they kept on taking wickets at regular intervals. Mandeep Singh however, with his late strikes in the last over of the innings enabled Punjab to post 166 runs on the board for the loss of nine wickets. Chris Morris had the best performance with the ball for Delhi as he took three wickets in the match.\nDelhi Capitals take on Sunrisers Hyderabad in their next match on April 04 whereas Kings XI Punjab will face Chennai Super Kings on April 06.\nBrief Scores: Kings XI Punjab 166/9 (DA Miller 43, SN Khan 39, CH Morris 3-30) defeat Delhi Capitals 152 all out (RR Pant 39, CA Ingram 38, S Curran 4-11) by 14 runs.

The aircraft is built by Lockheed Martin Corp. The disagreement over the F-35 is the latest of a series of diplomatic disputes between the United States and Turkey including Turkish demands that the United States extradite Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, differences over Middle East policy and the war in Syria, and sanctions on Iran.\nA Pentagon official had told Reuters in March that the United States had a number of items it could withhold in order to send Turkey a signal that the United States was serious about Ankara dropping its ambition to own the S-400.\nTurkish officials in Ankara were not immediately available for comment.\nNato summit\nThe U.S. decision on the F-35s was expected to complicate Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu\u2019s planned visit to Washington this week for a NATO summit. The latest development in the F-35 dispute came a day after Erdogan suffered one of his biggest electoral losses in decades in local elections.\nReuters reported last week that Washington was exploring whether it could remove Turkey from production of the F-35.

Sources familiar with the F-35\u2019s intricate worldwide production process and U.S. thinking on the issue last week said Turkey\u2019s role can be replaced.\nThe United States and other NATO allies that own F-35s fear the radar on the Russian S-400 missile system will learn how to spot and track the jet, making it less able to evade Russian weapons in the future.\nIn an attempt to persuade Turkey to drop its plans to buy the S-400, the United States offered the pricier American-made Patriot anti-missile system in a discounted deal that expired at the end of March. Turkey has shown interest in the Patriot system, but not at the expense of abandoning the S-400.\nTurkey has engaged with U.S. negotiators in recent days about buying the Patriot system, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The system is made by Raytheon Co.\nTurkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar in March said that despite some issues, Turkish pilots were continuing their training at an air base in Arizona on the F-35, each of which costs $90 million, and that Ankara was expecting the aircraft to arrive in Turkey in November.\nU.S. lawmakers also have expressed alarm over Turkey\u2019s planned purchase of the Russian system. Four U.S. senators last week introduced a bipartisan bill that would prohibit the transfer of F-35s to Turkey until the U.S. government certifies that Ankara will not take delivery of the S-400 system. \u0394\u03b5\u03af\u03c4\u03b5 \u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "turke", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "erdogan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raytheon patriot", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T01:04:21.036+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0f6a316d05a502287ced145287021cbee167bd9a", "url": "https://in.investing.com/news/economy-news/euus-trade-talks-face-delay-risking-trump-backlash-1517506", "site_full": "in.investing.com", "site": "investing.com", "site_section": "https://in.investing.com/", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Investing.com India - Financial News, Shares &amp; Quotes", "title": "EU-U.S. Trade Talks Face Delay, Risking Trump Backlash By Bloomberg", "title_full": "EU-U.S. Trade Talks Face Delay, Risking Trump Backlash By Bloomberg", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED080H9_L.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 699, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0f6a316d05a502287ced145287021cbee167bd9a", "url": "https://in.investing.com/news/economy-news/euus-trade-talks-face-delay-risking-trump-backlash-1517506", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bloomberg", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "EU-U.S. Trade Talks Face Delay, Risking Trump Backlash By Bloomberg", "text": "\u00a9 Reuters. EU-U.S. Trade Talks Face Delay, Risking Trump Backlash (Bloomberg) -- European Union governments are struggling to reach consensus on a mandate to begin trade talks with the U.S., risking a delay that would further provoke Donald Trump\u2019s ire after the bloc\u2019s refusal to include agriculture in the negotiations.\nAt a meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday, France is expected to resist giving the European Commission the green light to start negotiations to eliminate industrial tariffs between the regions, according to two officials familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the talks are private. Failure to get France on board would mean the EU\u2019s executive arm won\u2019t be given a mandate to negotiate.\nThe main sticking points include the role of climate and environment in the mandate given the U.S. decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord and a clarification of what this negotiation would mean for the shelved Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, according to the officials.\nA draft mandate prepared ahead of the meeting of ambassadors and seen by Bloomberg reiterates that the EU seeks trade accords only with countries that have signed up to the Paris agreement against climate change, even though the U.S. has pulled out.\nThe EU has been trying to kick start trade deliberations with the U.S. in a bid to show President Trump progress in enacting a political accord that he reached with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in July. That agreement helped put on hold the American threat of tariffs on European cars and auto parts.\nWashington has shown frustration over the lack of progress since, with U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland saying in a February interview that \u201cso long as the EU leadership plays the delay game the more we will have to use leverage to realign the relationship.\u201d\nEU-U.S. Trade Talks Face Delay, Risking Trump Backlash", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fin.investing.com%2Fnews%2Feconomy-news%2Feuus-trade-talks-face-delay-risking-trump-backlash-1517506&title=EU-U.S.+Trade+Talks+Face+Delay%2C+Risking+Trump+Backlash&summary=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=179222828858436&u=https%3A%2F%2Fin.investing.com%2Fnews%2Feconomy-news%2Feuus-trade-talks-face-delay-risking-trump-backlash-1517506&display=popup&ref=plugin", "https://invst.ly/afncj"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg \u00a9 reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "transatlantic trade and investment partnership", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T01:05:35.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1fcb84cf7a55862e715bf1a4e6f0a72497035540", "url": "https://in.investing.com/news/commodities-news/update-1us-considering-additional-iran-sanctions-perhaps-in-may-official-1517542", "site_full": "in.investing.com", "site": "investing.com", "site_section": "https://in.investing.com/", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Investing.com India - Financial News, Shares &amp; Quotes", "title": "UPDATE 1-U.S. considering additional Iran sanctions, perhaps in May -official By Reuters", "title_full": "UPDATE 1-U.S. considering additional Iran sanctions, perhaps in May -official By Reuters", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.333, "main_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/Brazil-Stock-Market_3_800x533_L_1414427437.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 699, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1fcb84cf7a55862e715bf1a4e6f0a72497035540", "url": "https://in.investing.com/news/commodities-news/update-1us-considering-additional-iran-sanctions-perhaps-in-may-official-1517542", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Reuters", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "UPDATE 1-U.S. considering additional Iran sanctions, perhaps in May -official By Reuters", "text": "UPDATE 1-U.S. considering additional Iran sanctions, perhaps in May -official (Adds Quote: s from official, details on potential sanctions)\nBy Jeff Mason\nWASHINGTON, April 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. government is considering additional sanctions against Iran that would target areas of its economy that have not been hit before, a senior Trump administration official told reporters on Monday.\nThe official said the administration aimed to follow through with new sanctions around the first anniversary of the U.S. withdrawal from a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and several world powers, which President Donald Trump announced last May.\n\"We just want a continued chilling effect,\" the official said. \"We want businesses to continue to think doing business with Iran is a terrible idea at this point.\"\nTrump announced last May that the United States would pull out of a 2015 international agreement designed to deny Tehran the ability to make nuclear weapons and he ordered sanctions be imposed again on the country.\nThe deal, agreed by the United States, France, Britain, Germany, Russia, China and Iran, sought to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb in return for the removal of sanctions that had crippled its economy.\nThe official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the administration hoped to take the additional measures in the coming weeks.\n\"The more we can do around the anniversary, the better,\" the official said, while adding that it takes time to put such sanctions together and that the U.S. Treasury Department was working on them.\nOne of the tools the United States has employed includes sanctions on oil imports from Iran. Washington has granted waivers to eight Iranian oil buyers, but could change that.\nThe official said the United States had the ability not to give those waivers at all. \"That, I think, is where we&apos;re headed,\" the official said.\nReducing the number of waivers would limit oil exports from Iran, the fourth-largest producer in OPEC. The United States set an earlier target of driving Iranian oil exports to zero, and the official said that goal had not changed.\nU.S. domestic oil production would help offset such a change, the official said.\nChina, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey are likely to be given waivers after they expire in May that could cap Iran's crude oil exports at about 1.1 million barrels per day, U.S.-based analysts at Eurasia Group said earlier this year. That would remove Italy, Greece and Taiwan from the current waivers list.\nUPDATE 1-U.S. considering additional Iran sanctions, perhaps in May -official", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fin.investing.com%2Fnews%2Fcommodities-news%2Fupdate-1us-considering-additional-iran-sanctions-perhaps-in-may-official-1517542&title=UPDATE+1-U.S.+considering+additional+Iran+sanctions%2C+perhaps+in+May+-official&summary=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=179222828858436&u=https%3A%2F%2Fin.investing.com%2Fnews%2Fcommodities-news%2Fupdate-1us-considering-additional-iran-sanctions-perhaps-in-may-official-1517542&display=popup&ref=plugin", "https://invst.ly/afnj3"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff mason", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tehran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T01:05:43.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "258ad4e941af8d6721f74bf00e6fac7e74e93ce6", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/elaineramirez/2019/04/01/blackpink-the-all-girl-k-pop-group-following-btss-footsteps-and-taking-over-the-u-s/", "site_full": "www.forbes.com", "site": "forbes.com", "site_section": "http://www.forbes.com/real-time/feed2/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Forbes Real Time", "title": "BlackPink: The All-Girl K-Pop Group Following BTS's Footsteps And Taking Over The U.S.", "title_full": "BlackPink: The All-Girl K-Pop Group Following BTS's Footsteps And Taking Over The U.S.", "published": "2019-04-02T01:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fthumbnails%2Fblog_4433%2Fpt_4433_1558_o.jpg%3Ft%3D1554154215", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 196, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "258ad4e941af8d6721f74bf00e6fac7e74e93ce6", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/elaineramirez/2019/04/01/blackpink-the-all-girl-k-pop-group-following-btss-footsteps-and-taking-over-the-u-s/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Elaine Ramirez", "published": "2019-04-02T01:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "BlackPink: The All-Girl K-Pop Group Following BTS's Footsteps And Taking Over The U.S.", "text": "The first girl group of any country to land on Forbes Asia\u2019s 30 Under 30 list, BLACKPINK has set the bar for female K-pop acts on the Billboard 200 and Hot 100 charts and is driving a frenzy among its \u201cBlink\u201d fans over its debut world tour later this month.\" itemprop=\"description\">\n<a _ngcontent-c3=\"\" aria-label=\"Forbes Homepage\" class=\"header__link--forbes-logo\" href=", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bigbang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blackpink", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "all-girl k-pop group following bts", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dua lipa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forbes asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T01:05:53.058+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0dabd3e75809917a41a5a22f2b7d15b3241b6be5", "url": "https://in.investing.com/news/world-news/us-considering-additional-iran-sanctions-perhaps-in-may-us-official-1517476", "site_full": "in.investing.com", "site": "investing.com", "site_section": "https://in.investing.com/news/world-news", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "World News -

Initially, Heather Strickey had thought someone was breaking in and as she huddled with her one daughter awaiting the arrival of police, a 9-1-1 operator broke the news.

The senior forward averaged 20.9 points, 10.5 rebounds and shot 61.4% during the regular season for the Huskies to earn a spot on The Associated Press women's basketball All-America team.\n\"There haven't been a lot of players like her that I've seen, a few, but not a lot,\" UConn coach Geno Auriemma said.\nShe was joined on the All-America team Monday by Iowa's Megan Gustafson, Oregon's Sabrina Ionescu, Louisville's Asia Durr and Mississippi State's Teaira McCowan. Voting was done before the NCAA Tournament by the 28-member national media panel that votes on the AP Top 25 each week.\nCollier received the most votes, garnering 27 first place votes from the panel. She is third on UConn's all-time scoring list with 2,386 points and third in shooting percentage and fourth in rebounding. The senior forward has been snubbed for many of the other major awards, not being named a finalist. She hasn't let it bother her.\n\"I don't need the validation but it's nice to be recognized,\" she said.\nGustafson put up eye-popping numbers at Iowa this season and got the Hawkeyes back to the Elite Eight for the first time since 1993. She averaged a Division I-best 28 points while also ranking second in rebounding. She had 33 double-doubles to tie the NCAA's single season record.\n\"She's completely taken over our record books,\" Iowa coach Lisa Bluder said. \"Her legacy will stand for a long, long time. People will remember her for the great teammate she is and what a humble great young woman she is.\"\nWhile Gustafson has been a double-double machine, Ionescu has rewritten the NCAA record book for triple-doubles and helped the Ducks reach the Final Four for the first time. She has 18 triple-doubles in her career, including one in the second round of the NCAA Tournament against Indiana. She averaged 19.6 points, 7.5 rebounds and 8.1 assists during the regular season for the Ducks. What's impressed her coach Kelly Graves is her competiveness.\n\"She's defined our program since she got here. The fortunes of our program have turned since she got here,\" he said. \"To go to the Elite Eight and what she's done that three years, that's crazy. We had only won five total NCAA games in the history of the program. She doesn't take plays off and hates to lose.\"\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Sports newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong Sports news, no matter the season.

I'm proud of that. I'll be in front row when she walks that stage. Her development as a young lady as well as a basketball player is like something I haven't seen.

Both Ford and Tory have called on the federal government to provide more resources to deal with the higher-than-usual number of refugee claimants who depend on provincial and municipal supports while their claims are assessed.\nIn Ottawa, the opposition Conservatives have put pressure on the Liberal government to close the loophole by making the principals of the Safe Third Country Agreement apply to the entire border. The Liberals have repeatedly said the government can\u2019t unilaterally amend an agreement with the United States.\nBut within government, there\u2019s long been an acknowledgement that the 2002 agreement has not been working as intended. That was the message in a January 2017 briefing note prepared for Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen before a meeting with Kristjen Nielsen, the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, which was obtained by the Canadian Press.\nBlair has been meeting with U.S. lawmakers and security officials on the issue since he assumed the newly created role of minister of border security in 2018, his office said.\nBeyond the issue of irregular migration, it\u2019s not clear what other border issues are on the table if negotiations begin in earnest.\n\u201cIt would be inappropriate to speculate on how any possible changes might be implemented in collaboration with our American counterparts going forward,\u201d wrote Marie-Emmanuelle Cadiuex, a spokesperson for Blair.\n\u201cWe do not discuss internal and interagency deliberations, nor do we discuss specific documents or communications that are involved in such deliberations,\u201d a U.S. State Department spokesperson told the Star in an email Monday. \u201cWe are not going to comment on any discussions with Canada on this matter.\u201d\nWith files from Tonda MacCharles\nAlex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

He is a product of Oklahoma State. The Chiefs clear more than $800,000 in 2019 cap space with the move, according to Spotrac .\nIn his three-year career, Ogbah has played and started in 40 games, compiling 122 tackles (70 solo), including 16 tackles for loss and 29 quarterback hits, 12.5 sacks, 17 passes defensed, two forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries.\nMurray, 25, a 6-foot-11, 199-pound safety, joined the Chiefs as a fourth-round pick (106th overall) in the 2016 NFL draft. He played in 45 games for the Chiefs, starting 11 of them. He was credited with 88 tackles (72 solo), an interception, a fumble recovery, a sack and seven passes defensed during his two years with the team. He played his college ball at Minnesota.\nThe Browns \u2014 one of eight NFL teams that started their offseason workouts on Monday \u2014 were without Ogbah during their first session because he was expecting to be traded. As it turned out, he was right.\nEven with the release of Eric Berry , Murray was not a certainty to start for the Chiefs at safety in 2019. Current Cleveland Browns general manager John Dorsey originally drafted Murray when he was with the Chiefs, so he traded for a player he originally liked and sent the Chiefs a player with good upside. Ogbah is a former high draft pick, which is becoming a trend for Chiefs general manager Brett Veach.\nHow Ogbah fits into the Chiefs\u2019 4-3 Under/Hybrid rotation raises questions for the futures of Allen Bailey \u2014 currently an unrestricted free agent whom the Chiefs were reportedly considering bringing back \u2014 and Tanoh Kpassagnon, who was also drafted by Dorsey and has never seemed to fit into the Chiefs\u2019 lineup.\nLETS SPIN EVERY BLOCK EVERY GAMEDAY. https://t.co/cmxFKuD5hL\n\u2014 Tyrann Mathieu (@Mathieu_Era) April 1, 2019 My brother brother\nLet\u2019s g !!!\n\u201cWe just had this conversation\u201d\nGod is good.... https://t.co/tx93R1qM1b\n\u2014 Chris Jones (@stonecoldjones_) April 1, 2019 Imagine Chiefs will use Ogbah inside on 3rd downs.

Learned About the Saudi Oil Giant More (Bloomberg) -- It was always suspected, and now it\u2019s official. Saudi Aramco is the world\u2019s most profitable company. Jealously guarded financial data about the kingdom\u2019s prized asset were disclosed to bond investors for the first time on Monday. Aramco\u2019s $111.1 billion profit in 2018 easily dwarfed all other businesses on the planet, a stunning result for a company that also paid the Saudi government $102 billion in taxes last year. Here are some insights from Aramco\u2019s financial statements: 1- Aramco leads all companies, oil and otherwise 2- It still lags other oil majors in profit per barrel Aramco, which produces about 10 percent of the world\u2019s crude, spends just under $3 a barrel to pump its crude but doesn\u2019t generate as much cash per barrel as other top oil companies. The culprit: high taxes. The kingdom depends on the company to finance social and military spending, as well as the lavish lifestyles of hundreds of princes. Funds flow from operations -- a measure closely watched by investors and similar to cash flow from operations -- was $26 a barrel equivalent of oil last year. That\u2019s below what Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total SA enjoy, at $38 and $31 per barrel, respectively. 3- All that income still doesn\u2019t support a $2 trillion valuation Saudi Arabia has long insisted that Aramco would fetch the lofty valuation, even after some investors made it clear in the early stages of the mooted initial public offering that they didn\u2019t share that view. The $58.2 billion in dividends paid to the Saudi government last year indicates the company is worth closer to $1.2 trillion if it\u2019s judged by the same metrics as other oil majors. 4- Aramco can easily digest a $69 billion acquisition The state-owned producer, officially known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., is selling a bond to help buy a 70 percent stake in chemical maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp. from the kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. Aramco will mostly use its own cash for the deal, with half of the payment due to the Public Investment Fund when it closes and the rest staggered until 2021. The installment plan will cost Aramco $500 million in interest. Aramco\u2019s ambition to be the world\u2019s top energy company, not just oil producer, will require more large acquisitions, and the Sabic deal is the right first step, said Stewart Williams, vice president for Middle East & North Africa Upstream at consultancy Wood Mackenzie Ltd. \u201cWith its finances there for all to see, many will be now asking what\u2019s next on Aramco\u2019s shopping list.\u201d 5- Investors are hungry for Aramco bonds \u201cThis launch has been eagerly awaited for some time and strong demand has already preceded it,\u201d said Richard Segal, a senior emerging-markets analyst at Manulife Asset Management in London. Aramco may end up paying a small premium to the kingdom\u2019s bonds. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign-debt yields have declined this year, making it cheaper for Aramco to borrow. Brent crude has also advanced 28 percent. 6- Aramco has little debt, but its credit isn\u2019t stellar Saudi Aramco was assigned the fifth-highest investment grade rating at both Moody\u2019s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings. Both firms said Aramco could have ranked even higher but was constrained by Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign rating. Even though Aramco lags peers like Shell, Total and Exxon Mobil Corp. in credit rating, its proposed acquisition of Sabic won\u2019t alter its current ranking thanks to its low debt load. 7- Aramco faces risks, including missiles and hackers The bond prospectus detailed risks for investors, including missiles falling on Aramco\u2019s installations, the impact of proposed U.S. antitrust laws on OPEC, the fight against climate change, and even fears that Saudi Arabia may break the peg between its currency and the U.S dollar. It also revealed Aramco was the victim of \u201csuccessful\u201d cyber attacks. The prospectus showed how reliant Aramco is on high prices. In 2016, when Brent crude plunged to an average $45 a barrel and OPEC cut production, the company struggled to break even.

The benchmark 10-year yield climbed 10 basis points, the most since Jan. 4, ending the first day of the second quarter at 2.50 percent. The much-watched 3-month to 10-year yield curve steepened. While a softer U.S. retail sales number helped restrain yields early in the U.S. morning, the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s factory gauge prompted a spike in rates, which then proceeded to grind higher through the U.S. afternoon. A strong manufacturing survey in China also helped buoy American equities and general risk appetite. The market witnessed a \u201cwide-spread risk-on and a deep sell-off in Treasury markets,\u201d wrote strategists at NatWest Markets including John Briggs. \u201cThe strong reading on manufacturing momentum helped the market shrug off what was a fairly disappointing reading on U.S. February retail sales.\u201d The move marks the continuation of a rebound in Treasury yields from late last week. The 10-year yield has moved higher since sliding to a 15-month low of 2.34 percent in the wake of the Federal Reserve last month lowered expectations for policy tightening.

Republicans, Chamber of Commerce question president's latest threat John Fritze and Eliza Collins Apr 1, 2019\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Border-state Republicans and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce balked Monday at President Donald Trump's latest threat to close the U.S.-Mexico border , arguing the move would damage the nation's economy.\nFrustrated by an influx of migrant families arriving from Central America , Trump has ratcheted up his rhetoric on sealing the border, threatening that his administration could close ports as early as this week if Mexico doesn't do more to stem the flow of arrivals.\nBut a number of Republicans representing border states urged caution, noting Mexico was the nation's third-largest trading partner last year. Others, including Republican leaders, stayed quiet as they sought to assess the seriousness of Trump's threat, which he has made previously without following through.\n\"The president made that statement out of frustration. I don't think he's going to actually shut off the border,\" Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told a forum in Washington on Monday.\n\"It would have a significant impact on our economy,\" he added.\n\"I understand the president\u2019s frustration, but the unintended consequences of that, I think, would be bad for everybody,\" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.\nSeveral Republicans on Capitol Hill didn\u2019t seem to see the president\u2019s threat as something immediate and instead focused on the need to deal with immigration.\n\u201cWhat do you mean, shut it down?\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., responded when asked about Trump's threat.\nWhite House officials did not respond to a request for comment Monday.\nIllegal immigration remains lower than it was during the 1990s and 2000s, when Border Patrol agents regularly apprehended more than 1 million undocumented immigrants a year at the southern border. But the administration has pointed to a spike in Central American families making the journey north.\nIn February, Border Patrol agents apprehended 66,450 people illegally crossing the southern border. A record high 36,174 of those (54%) were members of families and 6,825 (10%) were unaccompanied minors, according to Border Patrol data .\nSpeaking to reporters Friday, Trump said there is a \"very good likelihood that I\u2019ll be closing the border next week\" to address the issue. White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday that the administration would need to see \"something dramatic\" to hold short of sealing the U.S. Mexico-border.\nThe idea has drawn tepid a response from some within Trump's party.\n\"It's my view that we've got to keep the legitimate trade and travel and cross-border commerce happening at the ports entry while we also need to secure our border and address this crisis,\" Sen. Martha McSally, R-Arizona, told reporters Monday.\nSen. James Lankford, R-Okla., wouldn't directly say whether he would support closing the border.\n\"What the president seems to be doing right now is trying to work with Mexico and with Central America, and say, 'If we don\u2019t find a way to work together to stop this, then I\u2019m going to have to find a way that\u2019s a blunt object to do it,'\" Lankford said.\nAt least one Democrat said the threat of border closure was real.\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve gotta take him seriously,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce also weighed in Monday, urging the administration to consider the costs to domestic exporters. The leading business organization said it shared the administration's concern about a \"massive influx of migrants\" but said the best response is for Congress to attempt a broader overhaul of immigration law.\n\"Even threatening to close the border to legitimate commerce and travel creates a degree of economic uncertainty that risks compromising the very gains in growth and productivity that policies of the Trump administration have helped achieve,\u201d said Neil Bradley, the group's executive vice president and chief policy officer.\nThe Commerce Department estimates $502 billion in goods crossed the border in trucks and trains last year, roughly $1.4 billion a day. That doesn't include products shipped by air and sea.\nAdministration officials have said the border has reached its \"breaking point,\" forcing Customs and Border Protection to use extreme measures to keep up. One of those changes has been to start releasing migrants into the streets of border communities, breaking with the administration's practice of detaining them as long as possible.\nTrump's proposal has met with support from some Republicans, while many others have not commented. Some Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, initially advised Trump against declaring an emergency at the border to free up federal funding for the wall, but then backed the move once Trump acted.\n\"Well, I mean, what are we supposed to do?\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a Trump ally told \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"So if the president feels like that the only way to control this problem is to move the people from the port of entry to the ungoverned spaces where we need a wall, I will support him. I hope we don't have to do that.\"\nTrump threatened to close the border several times last year, but the administration did not follow through on the threat.\n\"Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants, many of whom are stone cold criminals, back to their countries,\" Trump tweeted in late November. \"We will close the Border permanently if need be.\"\nContributing: Alan Gomez, USA TODAY, and The Arizona Republic", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "michael mccaul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. chamber of commerce", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "house foreign affairs committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T01:28:13.054+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c10782cd426d9692500b3d5b12a9a14f74270e4", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2771500567", "site_full": "www.goodreads.com", "site": "goodreads.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["books_and_literature", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "MJ (La Carlota City, Negros Occidental, Philippines)\u2019s review of Pretty Reckless", "title_full": "MJ (La Carlota City, Negros Occidental, Philippines)\u2019s review of Pretty Reckless", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.076, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 300, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2c10782cd426d9692500b3d5b12a9a14f74270e4", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2771500567", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "L.J.

Senate The rejection followed alleged discovery of an illegal Special Economic Zone Company, listed for appropriation when the Minister of Trade and Investment Dr Okechukwu Enelamah appeared for budget defence on Monday.\nThe Chairman of the committee, Sen. Sabo Mohammed while referring to item two on page seven of the budget booklet presented by the ministry, said the company was not known to be one of the 17 agencies under the ministry.\nThe ministry had in the course of the defence, presented the booklet containing 2019 budget proposals for all agencies under the ministry.\nAccording to Mohammed, a document obtained by them from the Corporate Affairs Commission ( CAC) containing information on how the company was registered, shows that \u201cit is a private company.\n\u201cLiability of the members are limited by share, which gives federal government 25 per cent and 75 per cent to private individuals.\u201d\nHe directed the minister to forward detailed written explanation on how the company got into the appropriation list, its management staff list and its staff strength as well as statement of account before consideration of 2019 budget proposal.\nResponding, Enelamah said the company was established through a Presidential Initiative and its approval was given at a Cabinet meeting held in May 2018 .\n\u201cOne of the areas that this government has focused on is infrastructure. The second area is industrialisation and the two have something in common.\n\u201cIf the government tries to do it alone, it would be extremely tasking.\n\u201cSo the President directed that we should bring other partners that can combine with whatever monies we have to build world class infrastructure which led to the establishment of the company in partnership with other investors,\u201d he said.
