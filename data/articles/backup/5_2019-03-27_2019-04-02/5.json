In it, the party made a long list of promises with focus on farmers, youth and economic development. It also made a number of promises in relation to the national security of the country.\nOne of the key promises made by the party was that it would modernise the armed forces if voted to power. \"Congress will reverse the trend of declining defence spending under the NDA government, and increase it to meet the requirements of the Armed Forces,\" reads the manifesto. \" We will expedite all modernisation programmes of the Armed Forces in a transparent manner. We will improve social security, education and health facilities for our Paramilitary Forces and families.\"\nControversially, the manifesto also says that Congress would review the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA). AFSPA gives special powers to the Army and central forces deployed in \"disturbed areas\" to kill anyone acting in contravention of law, arrest and search any premises without a warrant and provide cover to forces from prosecution and legal suits without the Central government's sanction.\nWhile those in favour of AFSPA have already begun questioning Congress, some accusing it of trying to undermine India's armed forces, the party has also assured that it would start unconditional talks for peace in Jammu and Kashmir and that armed and paramilitary forces would be reduced in the state while more cops would be deployed. The manifesto also assured that no changes would be made to J&K's constitutional position and that three interlocutors from civil society would be appointed for talks for peace.

That reinforced concerns that while both economies face a slowdown, the euro region looks set to come out worse. Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale, said that while there was little correlation between the gap in the Purchasing Managers Index surveys in the euro zone and the United States, signs of weakness would test the single currency as it fell towards the bottom of its recent trading range.\n\"The market is bearish and short, the poor data are not unexpected, but even so, a break through $1.1150 would surely trigger short-term stops,\" he said.\nThe euro weakened as much as 0.2 percent to $1.1190, slightly above the $1.1176 level reached last month - the weakest since June 2017.\nThe dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of rival currencies, rose as much as 0.3 percent to 97.430 , a three-week high, helped by a rally in U.S. stocks on Monday and the more positive U.S. data.\nAustralia's dollar shed more than 0.6 percent to $0.7065 . The Reserve Bank of Australia's stress on the \"downside risks for the global growth environment\" on Tuesday probably caused the selloff even as the central bank kept interest rates on hold, said Commerzbank analyst Esther Reichelt.\nThe Australian government downgraded its growth forecasts on Tuesday but said it expected the economy to extend its enviable recession-free run of growth into a third decade. Reichelt said the Aussie should rebound, helped by optimism over crucial trading partner China.\nSterling dropped half a percent after lawmakers rejected four Brexit proposals, heightening Britain's uncertainty just 10 days before it is due to leave the European Union. The pound fell to $1.3025 before stabilising around $1.3050 and stood at 85.835 pence against the euro . The safe-haven Swiss franc strengthened to below 1.12 per euro and near 2019 highs. It touched 1.1182 francs, not far from the 2019 highs of 1.1164 hit last week.\nRBC Capital Markets strategist Adam Cole said he did not expect the franc to hold its gains because the Swiss National Bank remained \"sensitive\" to a stronger currency, particularly when it traded beyond 1.12 francs per euro.\nThe SNB will be \"the last central bank in the developed world to tighten rates,\" he said, and that should weigh on the currency in the medium-term.\nCryptocurrencies surged. Bitcoin jumped 20 percent to touch $5,000, its highest since November. Analysts struggled to explain the buying spree.\n(Editing by Larry King, Andrew Cawthorne, William Maclean) Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and may not reflect those of Kitco Metals Inc.

In counties with the highest audit rates, there were about 11 audits per 1,000 tax returns, while the national average is about 7.7, the study found.\nIn the meantime, statistic showed that the states with the lowest audit rates tend to have large middle-income white populations, such as the New England states, Wisconsin and Minnesota.\nGenerally, the IRS audits taxpayers with household income between 50,000 and 100,000 U.S. dollars the least, the study showed.\nKim Bloomquist, a former IRS economist who authored the study, believed that the IRS targeted poorer regions because many of those residents are recipients of the Earned Income Tax Credit, a program aimed at providing tax relief for low-income households.\nDemocratic lawmaker Terri Sewell said in a response to the study that taxpayers shouldn't be \"disproportionately targeted for claiming a certain tax credit\" and that Congress \"must ensure that the IRS initiates and executes audits in a fair and impartial manner.\" [ Editor: WPY ] Share or comment on this article More From Guangming Online", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-04/02/c_137943072.htm"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "xinhua", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tax notes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. internal revenue service", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south texas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T15:23:26.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7ccfa142d36536cca21ec55c4381fa6ba39da307", "url": "http://en.gmw.cn/2019-04/02/content_32708502.htm", "site_full": "en.gmw.cn", "site": "gmw.cn", "site_section": "http://en.gmw.cn/rss_en.xml", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "\u5149\u660e\u7f51", "title": "U.S., S.Korea defense chiefs meet on peninsula denuclearization", "title_full": "U.S., S.Korea defense chiefs meet on peninsula denuclearization", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7ccfa142d36536cca21ec55c4381fa6ba39da307", "url": "http://en.gmw.cn/2019-04/02/content_32708502.htm", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "U.S., S.Korea defense chiefs meet on peninsula denuclearization", "text": "U.S., S.Korea defense chiefs meet on peninsula denuclearization 0 2019-04-02 10:56 By: Xinhua\nWASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan met here on Monday with South Korean Minister of National Defense Jeong Kyeong-doo over the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, said the Pentagon.\nDuring their meeting, Shanahan and Jeong focused on the on-going diplomatic efforts to achieve a complete denuclearization of and peace on the Korean Peninsula, according to a statement released by the Pentagon.\nThe two defense chiefs vowed to remain \"an unwavering combined readiness posture,\" said the statement.\nThey also pledged to enhance coordination and cooperation in various areas including information sharing on issues regarding the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), it added.\nJeong's visit came one month after the second summit between the top DPRK leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump in late February in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi that ended without an agreement.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in, who is scheduled to visit Washington next week, said Monday that Pyongyang and Washington have shown their determination to continue the dialogue by managing situations stably so as not to increase tensions as seen in the past.\nMoon vowed to make efforts to help resume denuclearization negotiations between the DPRK and the United States.\nThe Korean Peninsula's peace process would become a journey, taken jointly by the two Koreas and the United States that would not be easy, he said.\nEarlier last month, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lu Kang said at a press conference that no one should expect the Korean Peninsula issue to be resolved in just one day, and the key is to take into account the legitimate concerns of all parties in a balanced way and consolidate mutual trust and gradually gather consensus.

It noted a \"phase-out\" of monetary stimulus in Europe and China's efforts to shift its economy away from its traditional reliance on manufacturing and investment toward services and consumption.\nIn 2018, trade grew by just 3% -- far below the WTO's forecast for 3.9%, which had itself been downgraded last year. And next year, the Geneva-based trade body expects only a small uptick in trade growth by volume next year, to 3%.\n\"There is potential for a slight improvement in 2020 but that is very much dependent on an easing of the trade tensions,\" he said.\nThe WTO oversees international trade rules and settles disputes between countries. The Trump administration has also been critical of the WTO, accusing it of being \"unfair\" with the United States.\nThe U.S. has slowly squeezed the WTO by blocking appointments to its dispute settlement group, the Appellate Body, which could in December fall below the minimum number of members required.\nAzevedo pointed to the \"fundamental importance of the rules-based trading system,\" saying that its weakening would \"be an historic mistake with repercussions for jobs, growth and stability around the world.\"\nRelated Stories Bank of Canada's Poloz says stimulative rates needed for temporary soft patch Eurozone economy gets double dose of bad news China sets 2019 economic growth target at 6 to 6.5 per cent Related Links WTO - Global trade growth loses momentum as trade tensions persist", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres19_e/pr837_e.htm"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roberto azevedo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "world trade organization", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "geneva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T16:15:34.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "87e0bebdfa630db91690d978beca90fb0ebc3a55", "url": "https://www.investing.com/analysis/ibm-and-world-wire-200401714", "site_full": "www.investing.com", "site": "investing.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "IBM Surprises, Chooses Stellar Platform For New Payment Transfer Service | Investing.com", "title_full": "IBM Surprises, Chooses Stellar Platform For New Payment Transfer Service | Investing.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.025, "main_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/companies_logos/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 699, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 10, "comments": 0, "shares": 21}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "87e0bebdfa630db91690d978beca90fb0ebc3a55", "url": "https://www.investing.com/analysis/ibm-and-world-wire-200401714", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "IBM Surprises, Chooses Stellar Platform For New Payment Transfer Service | Investing.com", "text": "Follow\nWhat's perhaps most surprising, and possibly even somewhat cutting edge about International Business Machines' (NYSE: IBM ) recently launched Blockchain World Wire payment transfer service isn't who the provider is, nor that the solution is blockchain-based. Rather it's the open-source platform on which it's built\u2014 Stellar Lumens , the ninth most popular cryptocurrency by market cap.\nJesse Lund, head of IBM's blockchain division praises the payments and settlement network saying it cements the tech giant's leadership in the blockchain technology space. He characterizes the development of World Wire, which is now being used by six international banks including Philippines-based RCBC, South Korea's Bank Busan and Brazil's Banco Bradesco as:\n\u201cWe\u2019re building on a new idea, which is to be able to store monetary value electronically and be able to move that value around the world in real time\u2026 I think the problem with cross-border payments today, the inefficiencies are based on the fact that the way that banks communicate, the network that banks communicate on is separate from the network or the rails that money actually moves on.\nMany would argue it's already possible to store monetary value electronically and move it around in real time. Banks are already virtual although the funds stored are not yet fully digital. Which means IBM may not really be doing anything groundbreaking here.\nThat is, unless you consider Big Blue's use of Stellar. Until now, larger rival XRP , formerly known as Ripple, had been the banking industry choice. That's because, according to its developers, \"it enables secure, instant and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks.\" But, says Viabhav Kadikar, CEO of CloseCross , a decentralized market prediction platform, Steller is the preferred chain for micropayments, as it's relatively inexpensive:\n\u201cIBM has made an operational decision in choosing them [Stellar] as a network to build on. A considerable difference to the current virtual offering by banks is that the proposed flow of funds through World Wire will not require after the fact, cross border reconciliations to be carried out. This process normally involves a number of banks and even federal banks, so with World Wire they are proposing an overall increase in efficiency and transparency.\u201d\nThe way IBM portrays it, they're building a new backbone for banks, using blockchain, explains Alex Frenkel, VP of product at Kin Ecosystem. He stresses that blockchain technology is slower and harder to maintain than a conventional database. Its main virtue is in the direct exchange of value between people around the world.\n\u201cI'm not sure this is the most efficient way to improve the banking backbone,\" he adds. \"The real revolution with blockchain and crypto is removing the need to use banks for sending value across the world. In this vision, banks will have a completely different role in the financial world and will not deal with controlling and validating value exchanges between people.\u201d\nBreaking Banks Out of Their Comfort Zone\nMany banks, however, are still operating within their comfort zone, Kadikar points out.\n\"But partnering with a tech giant like IBM will [make them] feel more confident trialing new technology.\nLarge banks and corporates need to be in their comfort zone when they attempt to trial or utilize new tech. They need a partner that is solid, large and reliable based on previous experiences as well as something their regulators will accept.\u201d\nTo that end, the launch of IBM's World Wire is a good thing for the overall blockchain landscape, especially for the payments industry where the back-end functions can develop at scale in a blockchain environment without any user experience friction.\nThere is also a case to be made that transaction times and fees will drop with this latest launch. Gadi Srebnik, blockchain team lead at Kin Blockchain, which is a fork of Stellar Blockchain, believes that has serious benefits for the end consumer. \"Clients will gain as work\u2014and costs\u2014are reduced on the banking side,\u201d he says.\nPerhaps more important than the workflow and settlement efficiencies, IBM is setting the technology standard that all banks will need to meet going forward, Jehan Chu, co-founder of Social Alpha Foundation and managing partner of Kenetic points out.\n\u201cAs banks compete even harder, the near instant global settlement across their network will eventually become the new norm. IBM is signalling where the future of finance lies, and it\u2019s built on blockchain.

Non-citizens comprise about 7 percent of the 328.7 million people living in the United States. Census questionnaires have not included a citizenship question since 1950.\nThe Supreme Court is reviewing a Jan. 15 ruling by U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan that Ross broke a \"veritable smorgasbord\" of federal rules by adding the question, a decision he called \"arbitrary and capricious.\"\nFurman also said the Voting Rights Act was as a \"pretextual\" rationale for adding the question, a decision that Ross had \"already made for other reasons.\"\nThe judge said the change would cause many states to lose federal funding, while Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas would lose congressional seats.\nFurman, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, stopped short of a finding that Ross intended to discriminate against immigrants.\nOral arguments at the Supreme Court are scheduled for April 23.\nSteven Dillingham, who became director of the U.S. Census Bureau in January, declined to discuss Trump's tweet but said the bureau was focused on obtaining a full, complete count.\nHe spoke to reporters at a press briefing on Monday, one year before National Census Day marking the 2020 count.\n'LONG PEDIGREE'\nFurman's decision came in a lawsuit brought by 18 U.S. states, 15 cities and a variety of civil rights groups.\nIn urging the Supreme Court to overturn Furman's ruling, Solicitor General Noel Francisco, representing the Justice Department, said Ross had discretion to add the citizenship question, and that there was a \"long pedigree\" in the census for asking about citizenship or country of birth.\nHe also said other democracies including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Indonesia, Ireland, Mexico, Spain and the United Kingdom ask about citizenship on their censuses.\nAnother federal judge, Richard Seeborg in San Francisco, on March 6 also declared the citizenship question illegal.\nFollowing that ruling, the Supreme Court said it will also decide whether Ross' actions violated the Constitution's Enumeration Clause, which sets out terms for counting people.\nAdding the citizenship question could lead to an undercount of 4.2 million Hispanics alone, the Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy estimated last month.\n(Reporting by Susan Heavey and Lauren Tara LaCapra in Washington, and Nick Brown and Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Susan Thomas and Bill Trott)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jonathan s", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "susan heavey", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white h", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan stempel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilbur ross", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commerce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mar-a-lago", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palm beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington/new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T16:35:49.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "af9e1b7183862afc282fd2ef6d91bd7117c341ae", "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/classic-cars/relive-the-sweeney-with-this-1976-ford-granada-s-barn-find/ar-BBVvanS", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "Car Reviews, New and Used Car Prices, Photos and Videos | MSN Autos", "title": "Relive The Sweeney With This 1976 Ford Granada S Barn Find!", "title_full": "Relive The Sweeney With This 1976 Ford Granada S Barn Find!", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 21, "comments": 1, "shares": 11}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "af9e1b7183862afc282fd2ef6d91bd7117c341ae", "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/classic-cars/relive-the-sweeney-with-this-1976-ford-granada-s-barn-find/ar-BBVvanS", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Calum Brown", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Relive The Sweeney With This 1976 Ford Granada S Barn Find!", "text": "Relive The Sweeney With This 1976 Ford Granada S Barn Find! Motorious 16 hrs ago Calum Brown\nTo those who grew up in 1970s\u2019 Britain, the imposing Ford Granada remains forever associated with London\u2019s all-time grittiest police drama. Punters would immediately recognize Ford\u2019s angular saloon as the vehicular star of The Sweeney , a spectacle so retro that the urge to slap orange wallpaper upon the kitchen walls, purchase flared trousers and bellow \u201cGuv\u2019nor\u201d at strangers becomes increasingly hard to ignore.\nIt\u2019s for this rose-tinted reason that we feel an irresistible pull towards eBay\u2019s current offering; a barn find 1976 Granada S . Throughout The Sweeney \u2019s four-year production run, various episodes concluded with the Granada enduring yet another mean chase down some of London\u2019s roughest streets, usually in pursuit of a villain\u2019s Jaguar S-type.\n\u00a9 Motorious 1976 Ford Granada S Barn Find Such action immortalized both vehicles, but whereas the Jag became inextricably linked with ill-fated thugs, the Ford gained popularity as transport for cantankerous Detective Inspectors. Problem is, they are rare beasts now. Purchased by uncaring drivers for cheap back in the day and driven into the ground with an outright lack of mechanical sympathy, finding a good first-generation Granada takes both time and patience.\nThe specimen currently up for grabs boasts one owner from new and has been stored away from the elements for 18 years. Rolled into storage in 2001, the Ford hasn\u2019t turned a wheel since. As if the 'barn find' status isn\u2019t enough, under the hood lurks the holy grail of Granada engines \u2013 Ford\u2019s 3.0-liter Essex V6, paired to manual transmission.\n\u00a9 Motorious 1976 Ford Granada S Barn Find Wholly original, both the exterior and interior remain untouched. Opening the cabin door reveals an original three-spoke steering wheel and correct dashboard dials. Then there are the seats, draped in oh-so \u201870s velour. The car\u2019s internal trim transports you straight back to the Bee-Gee era of pointed shirt collars. Just looking at it conjures the slick warble of wah-wah guitars. We're smitten.\nResearch Make (e.g. Mazda) Acura Alfa Romeo AM General Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Buick Cadillac Chevrolet Chrysler Daewoo Dodge Eagle Ferrari Fiat Fisker Ford Freightliner Genesis Geo GMC Honda Hummer Hyundai Infiniti Isuzu Jaguar Jeep Karma Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lincoln Lotus Maserati Maybach Mazda McLaren Mercedes-Benz Mercury MINI Mitsubishi Nissan Oldsmobile Plymouth Pontiac Porsche Ram Rolls-Royce Saab Saturn Scion smart SRT Subaru Suzuki Tesla Toyota Volkswagen Volvo Although unmolested, the bodywork will require some attention as rust and oxidisation remain spread across the corners of various panels. The vendor also states that the engine has not been turned over since removal from its slumber. All the factory-installed running gear is present and correct, but the drivetrain will no doubt require a strip-down rebuild to ensure no components are on route to self-detonation.\nRegistered on March 1, 1976, the Granada S has covered 179k miles and comes with all the necessary paperwork. An incredibly rare find, this vehicle would make for a solid restoration project. You\u2019ll be hard pressed to find another example like this, that\u2019s for sure. Currently residing at \u00a33k, the auction still has 6 days to go.

This Week A salute to the importance of the national count, Santa Clara County hosts a launch event on Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. By Sue Wood, Patch Staff | Apr 1, 2019 12:07 pm ET 0 The county hopes residents will contribute because an accurate count results in critical funds and representation. (Shutterstock) SAN JOSE, CA -- The one-year countdown to Census 2020 has begun.\nSanta Clara County will host the U.S. Census Bureau, governmental agencies, nonprofits, and community partners on April 2 to address critical issues before the Census launch.\n\"The county of Santa Clara relies on almost $500 million in annual census-based funds to provide critical services to its residents,\" said Nick Kuwada, Census 2020 program manager for the county. \"The consequences of an incomplete count would be enormous for the county and its residents because it would lead to less funding for roads, healthcare and other vital services the community relies on.\"\nU.S. Census representatives will join the county at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday at the Mexican Heritage Plaza located at 1700 Alum Rock Ave. in San Jose\nFor the first time in history, the Census will be conducted primarily online instead of by mail. Santa Clara County residents will have four methods for response: internet, phone, paper form or in-person.\nMore than $675 billion in federal funding is distributed annually based on census data. Of that amount, California receives over $76 billion.\nMoreover, congressional representation is based on census data.\nThe Census has prompted a variety of concerns over questions ranging from immigration status to sexual orientation. Other challenges the Santa Clara County cites involve:\nFewer than seven in 10 households said they intend to fill out the census form.

Spinal taps and other tests failed to find a cause. Doctors worried he was about to lose the ability to breathe.\n\"It's devastating,\" said his father, Jeremy Wilcox, of Herndon, Virginia. \"Your healthy child can catch a cold -- and then become paralyzed.\"\nJoey, who survived but still suffers some of the effects, was one of 228 confirmed victims in the U.S. last year of acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM, a rare, mysterious and sometimes deadly paralyzing illness that seems to ebb and flow on an every-other-year cycle and is beginning to alarm public health officials because it is striking more and more children.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it may bear similarities to polio, which smouldered among humans for centuries before it exploded into fearsome epidemics in the 19th and 20th centuries.\nFauci, who published a report about the disease Tuesday in the journal mBio, said it is unlikely AFM will become as bad as polio, which struck tens of thousands of U.S. children annually before a vaccine became available in the 1950s.\nBut he warned: \"Don't assume that it's going to stay at a couple of hundred cases every other year.\"\nWhile other countries have reported cases, including Canada, France, Britain and Norway, the size and pattern of the U.S. outbreaks have been more pronounced. More than 550 Americans have been struck this decade. The oldest was 32. More than 90% were children, most around 4, 5 or 6 years old.\nMost had a cold-like illness and fever, seemed to get over it, then descended into paralysis. In some cases it started in small ways -- for example, a thumb that suddenly wouldn't move. Some went on to lose the ability to eat or draw breath.\nMany families say their children have regained at least some movement in affected limbs, but stories of complete recovery are unusual. Health officials cannot say how many recovered completely, partly or not at all, or how many have died, though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says deaths are rare.\nScientists suspect the illness is being caused chiefly by a certain virus that was identified more than 55 years ago and may have mutated to become more dangerous. But they have yet to prove that.\nAnd while doctors have deployed a number of treatments singly or in combination -- steroids, antiviral medications, antibiotics, a blood-cleansing process -- the CDC says there is no clear evidence they work.\nMany parents say that when they first brought their child to the emergency room, they quickly realized to their horror that the doctors were at sea, too.\n\"Everyone is desperate for some magical thing,\" said Rachel Scott, a Tomball, Texas, woman whose son Braden developed AFM in 2016 and has recovered somewhat after intensive physical therapy but still cannot move his right arm and has trouble swallowing and moving his neck.\nA growing number of experts agree that physical therapy makes a difference.\n\"These kids can continue to recover very slowly, year over year. ... It's driven by how much therapy they do,\" said Dr. Benjamin Greenberg of UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, one of the nation's foremost experts on the condition.\nWilcox, Joey's father, said his son made huge improvements that way. Joey can run and use his arms. Still, muscle tone is weak in his right leg and shoulder, and he still has left-side facial paralysis. \"He can't completely smile,\" his dad said.\nOther stories are more tragic.\nKatie Bustamante's son Alex developed AFM in 2016. The suburban Sacramento, California, mother realized something was wrong when she asked the boy, then 5, why he wasn't eating his yogurt. Alex replied that his thumb had stopped working and he couldn't hold his spoon.\nThat morning was the start of 17 months of hospital stays, surgeries, therapy, and struggles with doctors and insurers to find a way to restore his ability to breathe. It ended one morning last May, when Alex died of complications.\nGovernment officials need to step up, Bustamante said.\n\"I want them to research it and find the cause, and I want them to find a way to prevent it,\" she said. \"This is growing. This shouldn't be happening.\"\nMore and more experts feel certain the main culprit is an enterovirus called EV-D68, based on the way waves of AFM have coincided with spikes of respiratory illnesses caused by EV-D68. Enteroviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which, such as polio, can damage the central nervous system, while many others cause mild symptoms or none at all.\nIn the U.S., doctors began reporting respiratory illnesses tied to EV-D68 in 1987, though usually no more than a dozen in any given year.\nThen, in what may have been one of the first signs of the AFM waves to come, a 5-year-old boy in New Hampshire died in 2008 after developing neck tenderness and fever, then weakened arms and deadened legs. The boy had EV-D68, and in a report published in an obscure medical journal, researchers attributed his death to the virus.\nThe first real burst of AFM cases hit in 2014, when 120 were confirmed, with the largest concentrations in California and Colorado.\nWhat ensued was an even-year, odd-year pattern: Cases dropped to 22 in 2015, jumped to 149 in 2016, and fell again, to 35 in 2017. Last year they reached 228, a number that may grow because scores of illnesses are still being investigated.\nIn keeping with the cyclical pattern, just four cases have been confirmed this year so far.\nCDC officials consider an illness AFM based on scans and other evidence showing a certain kind of damage to the spinal cord. Proof of an enterovirus infection is not required for a case to be counted, mainly because such evidence has been hard to come by. So far, CDC investigators have been able to find evidence of enteroviruses in the spinal fluid of only four of 558 confirmed cases.\nScientists are using more sensitive spinal-fluid tests in hopes of establishing the connection between AFM and EV-D68 more firmly. That, in turn, could spur more focused work on treatments and maybe even a vaccine.\nMeanwhile, Fauci's agency has put out a call for researchers to apply for federal funds, and is tapping a University of Alabama-anchored network of pediatric research centres to work on the illness.\nThe CDC is pledging a greater focus, too. Parents have accused the agency of doing little more than counting cases and have complained that when they tried to contact CDC, they encountered only automated phone trees and form responses.\nCDC officials have begun holding meetings and calls with families, set up a scientific task force and working to monitor cases more closely.\nFauci suggested it would be a mistake to assume that surges will take place every other year forever. The next one \"may be in 2019, for all we know,\" he said.\n-", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "braden scott", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "joey wilcox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeremy wilcox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike stobbe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. phillip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "braden", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tomball", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herndon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T18:01:56.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2fd19b771c23605bd3f28b810eefa1db5556269c", "url": "https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/gm-u-vehicle-sales-fall-7-percent-first-144620517--sector.html", "site_full": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "GM U.S. new vehicle sales fall 7 percent in first quarter", "title_full": "GM U.S. new vehicle sales fall 7 percent in first quarter", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/l.fGOHgrid_l07zV6Vgr5A--~B/aD0zMDg7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2019-04-02T144620Z_1_LYNXNPEF31101_RTROPTP_2_AUTOS-GM.JPG", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2fd19b771c23605bd3f28b810eefa1db5556269c", "url": "https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/gm-u-vehicle-sales-fall-7-percent-first-144620517--sector.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "GM U.S. new vehicle sales fall 7 percent in first quarter", "text": "(Reuters) - General Motors Co on Tuesday reported a 7 percent fall in U.S. new vehicle sales for the first quarter, hit by declines in passenger car sales.\nThe No. 1 U.S. automaker said it sold 665,840 vehicles in the first quarter, compared with 715,794, a year earlier.\nAmerican consumers have been abandoning traditional passenger cars in favour of more comfortable SUVs, although demand in recent quarters has also been weak for the more popular larger vehicles.\nSales of high-margin vehicles like Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks and Chevrolet Suburban SUV fell during the quarter.\nSmaller rival Ford Motor Co is due to report quarterly auto sales figures on Thursday.\n(Reporting by Rachit Vats and Sanjana Shivdas in Bengaluru;

Lance Cheung JOHN HAYWARD 2 Apr 2019 The United States deployed a reconnaissance aircraft that specializes in monitoring missile launches to Japan over the weekend, possibly to make it ready for monitoring North Korea\u2019s recently refurbished ballistic missile test sites. Stars & Stripes on Tuesday published reports from Okinawa about the arrival of the aircraft, noting that it might also have been moved because of flooding at its normal hangar in Nebraska:\nAn Air Force RC-135S Cobra Ball landed at Kadena Air Base on Saturday evening, according to Satoru Kuba, an Okinawan who monitors military aircraft traffic for Japan\u2019s Fuji Television. The 135-foot-long, Cold War-era aircraft was parked in a hangar and was still at Kadena as of Tuesday.\nNorth Korea has rebuilt a launch site at Sohae that it had partially dismantled as part of disarmament steps last year, according to recent satellite images. However, the Cobra Ball\u2019s deployment could also be related to flooding at Offutt Air Force Base, Neb., where the Air Force\u2019s three Cobra Ball aircraft are permanently based.\nAll Cobra Balls are operated by the Air Force\u2019s 55th Wing and manned by crews from the 45th Reconnaissance and 97th Intelligence squadrons, according to an Air Force website.\nKuba said the aircraft stopped in Europe, the Middle East, Diego Garcia and Indonesia before arriving in Japan. He said the rest of the 55th Wing deployed to MacDill Air Force Base, Fla.\nAn official with the Okinawan Ministry of Defense intriguingly told Stars & Stripes his office was not made aware of the Cobra Ball\u2019s arrival.\nThe RC-135S Cobra Ball is precisely the sort of aircraft that would be deployed on short notice to closely observe activity at a North Korean missile site. The same platform was used to monitor activity in North Korea prior to its \u201cdiplomatic opening\u201d to South Korea and the United States last year.\nSouth Korean officials said on Monday that North Korea might be about to test-launch a missile from the restored Sohae Satellite Launching Station, which has been undergoing renovations since shortly before the summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and dictator Kim Jong-un in February.\nThere has been much speculation among observers as to whether Pyongyang performed these renovations merely to increase pressure on the U.S. during negotiations, knowing full well that satellite photographs would pick up the activity, or if the North is seriously preparing to conduct a new missile test disguised as a \u201csatellite launch.\u201d The last such launch occurred in February 2016. Kim promised to dismantle the Sohae facility at a summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in September.\nSouth Korean analysts said on Tuesday they believe an imminent launch is unlikely, as the North has rebuilt Sohae but has not resupplied it with the equipment necessary to actually launch a rocket. They added that missile parts and launch equipment can be moved to the facility fairly quickly if Pyongyang decides to proceed with a missile test.\nSouth Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo, speaking from Washington after a meeting with Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, said it is still too early to tell if Sohae was reconstructed for show or if Pyongyang seriously intends to use the facility again.\nSouth Korean officials pointed to North Korea pulling out of several recent denuclearization meetings at the last minute as a sign the diplomatic thaw is ending and Pyongyang could be gearing up for fresh provocations. One of those recalcitrant North Koreans is Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui, who was both a key player in arranging the Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi and a primary source of threats that the unsuccessful conclusion of the summit would have dire consequences.\nPresident Moon\u2019s office signaled over the weekend that a special envoy may be sent to Pyongyang in a last-ditch effort to keep diplomacy alive. Moon, who will meet with President Trump in two weeks, warned on Monday that \u201cif dialogue fails at this moment, the situation will become even worse.\u201d\n Denuclearization Japan missile test North Korea RC-135S Cobra Ball Sohae Satellite Launching Station south korea", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3061299", "https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20190402004300325?section=news", "https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-715222-1", "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/font-awesome@4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css", "https://media.brei", "https://www.googletagservices.com/tag/js/gpt.js", "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/animate.css@3.5.2/animate.min.css", "https://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/missile-tracking-aircraft-arrives-on-okinawa-amid-fears-n-korea-may-lift-testing-moratorium-1.575287", "https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104498/rc-135s-cobra-ball/", "https://theaviationist.com/2017/09/22/these-spyplanes-are-watching-north-koreas-next-test/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lance cheung john hayward", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoru kuba", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fuji television", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "air force", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sohae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "okinawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kadena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nebraska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kadena air base", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T18:13:19.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cb777f8edf6130ade88f2578d4797f6776f46d3b", "url": "https://in.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stocks--us-futures-pause-after-rally-on-manufacturing-rebound-1518058", "site_full": "in.investing.com", "site": "investing.com", "site_section": "https://in.investing.com/news/most-popular-news", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Most Popular Financial News on Investing.com India", "title": "Stocks - U.S. Futures Pause After Rally on Manufacturing Rebound By Investing.com", "title_full": "Stocks - U.S. Futures Pause After Rally on Manufacturing Rebound By Investing.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC6A1E5_L.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 699, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cb777f8edf6130ade88f2578d4797f6776f46d3b", "url": "https://in.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stocks--us-futures-pause-after-rally-on-manufacturing-rebound-1518058", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Investing.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Stocks - U.S. Futures Pause After Rally on Manufacturing Rebound By Investing.com", "text": "\u00a9 Reuters.

She was worried her MS symptoms would affect the outcome of the test.\n\u201cIf I would have had a flare-up where my speech was impaired, like it has been during flare-ups in the past, I would have instantly failed,\u201d says Gray, who lives in Middle Sackville, N.S.\nGray did pass the test and was deemed sober, which means she wasn\u2019t charged with impaired driving.\nHowever, her licence was still suspended for seven days, and her car was impounded because she had tested positive for THC during the roadside test.\nGray says she missed four days of work as a result and had to pay almost $300 to get her car back.\nShe says it makes no sense because she wasn\u2019t actually impaired.\n\u201cJust because I tested positive for that roadside test for impairment does not mean I was impaired,\u201d she says.\nAnd RCMP Cpl. Lisa Croteau says Gray is actually correct.\n\u201cThere is no correlation between the level that you\u2019re at, the active THC in your body, and impairment,\u201d says Croteau.\nSo why did Gray still have her licence suspended and car impounded?\nAttorney Tom Singleton says the problem lies with Nova Scotia\u2019s Motor Vehicle Act, which gives police the power to issue suspensions for drivers who fail a roadside screening test, regardless of proof of impairment.\nSingleton says the same thing can also happen with alcohol.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a penalty being imposed before there\u2019s any process to determine if there\u2019s guilt or innocence,\u201d he says.\nGray says she has hired a lawyer and plans to challenge the law in court.\nWith files from CTV Atlantic's Heidi Petracek Photos Michelle Gray says she was shocked when she tested positive for THC during a roadside test because it had been six hours since she had taken cannabis. She was even more stunned when she passed a sobriety test, but still had her car impounded and licence suspended despite passing the test.

Frazier / StateImpact Pennsylvania April 01, 2019 | 05:45 PM Officials fine U.S. Steel for Clairton emissions from 2018, note situation has been improving Amy Sisk Recent Stories Amy Sisk reports for StateImpact Pennsylvania and WESA, Pittsburgh's NPR member station. She comes to Pennsylvania from another energy-rich state, North Dakota, where she told stories from coal mines, wind farms and the Bakken oil patch for Inside Energy and Prairie Public Broadcasting. Amy's stories often air on NPR, including those from the eight months she spent following the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. A reporting trip to the Bakken during its boom years sparked her interest in energy. Ever since, she's covered the industry -- from the way it is regulated to its influence on policy to its impact on people and the environment.\nThe Allegheny County Health Department has fined U.S. Steel $700,000 for ongoing emissions problems at its coke-making plant in Clairton near Pittsburgh.\nThe fine covers violations at the Clairton Plant during the second half of 2018. It comes after two other significant fines last year for similar problems after inspectors noted an uptick in leaks of coke oven gas. U.S. Steel has appealed both penalties, and a spokesperson says it\u2019s reviewing the latest fine.\nThe problems associated with the penalties are unrelated to a December fire that damaged pollution controls at the plant. Jim Kelly, deputy director of environmental health for the county health department, said they have to do with the operation of Clairton\u2019s batteries.\nEach battery has several ovens that bake coal at high temperatures to remove impurities. The resulting coke is used to make steel, but the process also generates gas.\nKelly said there are thousands of places at the facility where emissions could potentially leak.\n\u201cOne of the biggest problems is leaking doors,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThe problems with those leaky doors is that\u2019s raw coke oven gas that\u2019s coming out of there.\u201d\nHe said the gas contains pollutants such as particulate matter and hydrogen sulfide, as well as toxins such as benzene and toluene.\nA June 2018 order from the health department required the company to rein in its emissions. If the company does not comply, the agency said it would idle several of Clairton\u2019s batteries.\nKelly said violations have dropped since issuing that order after they peaked at 169 during the second quarter of 2018. The most recent data for the last quarter of the year shows 75 violations, he said.\n\u201cThose violations are improving,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are seeing fewer violations and therefore each quarter hopefully we will see a lower penalty assessed.\u201d\nHe said several factors could be helping, including more training for Clairton\u2019s workers and better maintenance of the batteries.\n\u201cBatteries operate at really high temperatures, so a lot of equipment gets deformed (and) bends,\u201d Kelly said.\nMeghan Cox, a spokesperson for U.S. Steel, said in a statement that the facility is working with state and local officials to protect jobs and the environment.\n\u201cWe are committed to improving the environmental performance of our Clairton Plant and are actively working to do so,\u201d she said.\nMeanwhile, work continues at Clairton to repair the facility\u2019s pollution controls after a fire damaged the equipment that processes its coke oven gas. Air monitors in the Mon Valley have recorded several spikes in sulfur dioxide since the fire occurred on Dec. 24.\nKelly said the work is ahead of schedule. The health department last month ordered the repaired equipment to be fully operational by April 15.

The Steadicam Steadimate-S is said to make holding single handle gimbals much easier too, so operators will be able to use them for longer without tiring.\nTiffen already markets the Steadicam Steadimate, which is designed for dual handled gimbals such as the DJI Ronin, and this new model works on the same principles but for single handled devices. The Steadimate-S consists of a bracket and a pair of counter weights. The bracket attaches the gimbal to the arm of the Steadicam vest and the weights ensure the gimbal remains upright. The gimbal then becomes part of the vest and benefits from the z-axis stabilization of the Steadicam arm as well as the x/y-axis stabilization of the gimbal\u2019s own gyro head. The company says this arrangement helps to eliminate the \u2018bounce\u2019 often seen in footage shot with single handed gimbals in walking shots.\nUsers have a choice of two kits to suit the weight of their set-up. The Steadicam Steadimate-S 15 System comes with the A-15 Steadicam Arm and Scout Vest and can be used with up to 6.8kg / 15lbs of kit, while those with camera/gimbal combinations that weigh up to 13.6kg / 30lbs will need the Steadimate-S 30 System that uses the A-30 Arm and Zephyr Vest. The Steadimate-S will also be available on its own for those who already have a vest and arm.\nNo prices have been released yet, but the existing Steadicam Steadimate for twin handled gimbals costs from just under $1700 with a vest and arm, or $500 on its own. For more information see the Tiffen website .\nPress release:\nTHE TIFFEN COMPANY DEMONSTRATES NEW STEADICAM STEADIMATE-S AT NAB 2019 Newest Camera Stabilizer Designed for Seamless Use with the DJI Ronin-S\u00ae\nThe Tiffen Company, the leading manufacturer of imaging accessories for the consumer/professional imaging and the motion picture and broadcast television industries, announces today the addition of the Steadimate-S to its Steadicam line of camera stabilizers.\nPresented for the first time at NAB 2019, the Steadicam Steadimate-S offers camera operators increased freedom, endurance, and creative opportunity when working with single-handed motorized stabilizers like the DJI Ronin-S\u00ae. By pairing a single-handed stabilizer with a body- worn stabilizer the DJI Ronin-S can be operated for hours with minimal physical fatigue while maintaining a wide range of vertical movement and adding full panning ability and \u201clow-mode\u201d operation.\nUsers can minimize or completely eliminate the bouncing image effect that often occurs when using single-handled stabilizers as the Steadimate-S provides x-axis and y-axis stabilization while the Steadicam arm provides z-axis stabilization. The addition of the Steadimate-S easily and affordably transforms single-handed motorized gimbals into professional video stabilization systems.\n\u201cThe Steadicam Steadimate-S is a new, elegant solution designed to add stability, operational comfort, and panning ability to single-handed stabilizers that are popular with camera operators,\u201d said Andrew Tiffen, SVP of Marketing, The Tiffen Company. \u201cWe look forward to debuting and demonstrating this latest camera stabilizer in our booth at the NAB Show next month.\u201d\nThe Steadimate-S comes standard with a post block and balance pin that fits arms with 1/2\" posts.

Washington has granted waivers to eight Iranian oil buyers, but could change that.\nThe official said the United States had the ability not to give those waivers at all. \"That, I think, is where we're headed,\" the official said.\nReducing the number of waivers would limit oil exports from Iran, the fourth-largest producer in OPEC. The United States set an earlier target of driving Iranian oil exports to zero, and the official said that goal had not changed.\nU.S. domestic oil production would help offset such a change, the official said.\nChina, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey are likely to be given waivers after they expire in May that could cap Iran\u2019s crude oil exports at about 1.1 million barrels per day, U.S.-based analysts at Eurasia Group said earlier this year. That would remove Italy, Greece and Taiwan from the current waivers list.\n(Reporting by Jeff Mason; additional reporting by Florence Tan in Singapore; Editing by James Dalgleish)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeff mason", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tehran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T18:32:55.084+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "66a31bebf75ece40ae975db3bfe1aadf2f79ccf2", "url": "https://www.sde.co.ke/article/2001319199/i-contemplated-suicide-after-ex-took-away-my-child-msupa-s-reveals", "site_full": "www.sde.co.ke", "site": "sde.co.ke", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "I contemplated suicide after ex took away my child, Msupa S reveals - Entertainment News", "title_full": "I contemplated suicide after ex took away my child, Msupa S reveals - Entertainment News", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "KE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.sde.co.ke/sdemedia/sdeimages/tuesday/my_ex_took_my_child_5ca334ac21096.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5906, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "66a31bebf75ece40ae975db3bfe1aadf2f79ccf2", "url": "https://www.sde.co.ke/article/2001319199/i-contemplated-suicide-after-ex-took-away-my-child-msupa-s-reveals", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Diana Anyango", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "I contemplated suicide after ex took away my child, Msupa S reveals - Entertainment News", "text": "Msupa S Photo: Courtesy.\nSandrah Chebet Koech popularly known as Msupa S has admitted to contemplating suicide because of a relationship.\nIn an emotional interview with Radio Jambo, The Kalenjin rap queen who rose to fame after her Watajua Hawajui collabo with Khaligraph Jones narrated the circumstances that led her considering committing suicide.\nAccording to Msupa S, she recently split from her baby daddy of six years alleging abuse and cheating.

Moon is expected to travel to the U.S. next week for his first meeting with the American leader since the Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi fell apart without an agreement advancing North Korea\u2019s disarmament.\nThe no-deal summit was a blow to Moon, whose administration had raised expectations that the meeting would achieve progress toward denuclearization. Moon has staked much of his political capital on the \u201cpeace process\u201d with North Korea and an extended break in negotiations between Trump and Kim could undermine his public support.\nSince Kim left Hanoi without a deal, North Korean diplomats have held news conferences blaming the U.S. for missing an opportunity in talks and demanding relief from economic sanctions. The regime has ignored South Korean calls for working-level meetings, criticizing Moon\u2019s government in state propaganda and at one point withdrawing staff from a joint liaison office set up in September.\nDomestic Criticism\nMoon also responded to domestic critics of his North Korea policies, saying it would be \u201cirresponsible\u201d and \u201cunhelpful\u201d to return to the past when nuclear tests and exchanges of sharp rhetoric between Trump and Kim stoked fears of reigniting war on the peninsula.\n\u201cSome are trying to reverse the tide of peace on the Korean Peninsula and widen a crack between the U.S.-South Korea alliance,\u201d Moon said. \u201cIt is never helpful to the national interest and the future of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d\nMoon has faced criticism for his efforts to advance inter-Korean economic projects after the summit, which contrasted with the U.S.\u2019s push to maintain sanctions pressure.\nMoon Faces New Pressure in South Korea to Revive Trump-Kim Talks\n\u201cDespite the Moon administration\u2019s continuing desire to ease sanctions even after the collapse of the Hanoi summit, the international community\u2019s sanctions have toughened,\u201d the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper said in a March 22 editorial. \u201cOur government must act in step with the rest of the world, earn Uncle Sam\u2019s trust and persuade Pyongyang to take sincere steps toward denuclearization.\u201d\nApproval Rating\nMoon\u2019s approval rating hit a record low of 43 percent, according to a Gallup Korea poll released Friday. Respondents criticized him for his policies on the domestic economy and his diplomacy with North Korea, the pollster said.\nSince Kim left Hanoi without a deal, North Korean diplomats have held news conferences to blame the U.S. for missing an opportunity in nuclear talks and demand relief from crippling economic sanctions. The country saw the lowest crop production last year in a decade, a United Nations report said last month.\nU.S. Said to Leave in Place Latest North Korea-Related Sanctions\nMoon\u2019s April 11 meeting with Trump will test his ability to continue playing a mediating role between the two leaders. The South Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo is slated to meet with his acting American counterpart, Patrick Shanahan, Monday in Washington to discuss joint military exercises between the allies that have been scaled down or cancelled to facilitate talks.\n(Updates with Moon Quote: under Domestic Criticism subheadline.)\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Youkyung Lee in Seoul at ylee582@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Scott at bscott66@bloomberg.net, Peter Pae\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com&quot;", "https://www.bloomberg.com"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "moon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "moon jae-in", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kim jong", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kim", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanoi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump-kim", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T18:34:25.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "539a03a8cc8014781f4cd3d22c41976b42baf97c", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/koa0601", "site_full": "twitcasting.tv", "site": "twitcasting.tv", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["television", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "\u30b3\u30a2 (@koa0601) 's Live - TwitCasting", "title_full": "\u30b3\u30a2 (@koa0601) 's Live - TwitCasting", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://imagegw03.twitcasting.tv/image3/image.twitcasting.tv/image75_1/d6/93/1ff293d6-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2374, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "539a03a8cc8014781f4cd3d22c41976b42baf97c", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/koa0601", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "\u30b3\u30a2 (@koa0601) 's Live - TwitCasting", "text": "Title of work being infringed Details\nI read and understand the following notes and send this form.
