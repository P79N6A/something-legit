REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo More By Arshad Mohammed, Patricia Zengerle and Richard Cowan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - People inside and outside the Trump administration scrambled on Monday to figure out what aid it plans to cut from three Central American nations and how that is a good idea given that much of the money aims to curb migration. The State Department said on Saturday it would carry out President Donald Trump's repeated threats to end U.S. foreign assistance programs with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Without providing evidence, Trump said on Friday the countries had \"set up\" caravans of migrants in order to export them to the United States. A surge of asylum seekers from the three countries, known collectively as the Northern Triangle, has sought to enter the United States in recent days. Congressional aides and U.S. officials said they were trying to establish what money would be eliminated, and even some of Trump's fellow Republicans questioned the wisdom of curbing the aid, much of which aims to reduce violence, gang activity and the illicit drug trade - all factors that send migrants north. \"If we cut all this funding, and a lot of it, quite honestly, is seriously law enforcement that we're doing down there ... I think it's going to make things tragically worse, not better,\" said Representative Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee. The State Department did not elaborate beyond its weekend statement that it was \"carrying out the President's direction and ending FY 2017 and FY 2018 foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle\" and would engage Congress. The U.S. fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30. Speaking on condition of anonymity, one congressional aide said it was his understanding the administration planned to reprogram \u2013 or dedicate to other purposes \u2013 about $450 million in fiscal-year 2018 funds. In addition, according to the aide, the department planned to review fiscal-year 2017 and 2018 funds that have been obligated, but not spent, and redirect those to other purposes. The aide and others said, however, that Congress had yet to receive any formal notices from the State Department about exactly which funds are involved, what they were originally for or where the department wants to reprogram them. Asked if the department knew what programs would be cut, a second congressional aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said: \"If they do, they haven't told us yet. My sense is they are trying to figure that out.\" 'TOTALLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE' A former U.S. official in contact with those still in the government said emails were flying around the State Department among officials trying to figure out what was going on. \"Nobody knows what this is,\" he said, adding that by midday on Monday, no instructions had been sent to U.S. aid missions in the region on how to implement the decision. The situation was reminiscent of a 2018 New Year's Day tweet in which Trump appeared to decree an end to U.S. aid for Pakistan, sending officials scrambling to suspend security aid without even knowing how much they were freezing. Critics argued the administration's planned Central America aid cutoff would be tantamount to cutting off its nose to spite its face. \"It's totally counterproductive,\" said Rebecca Bill Chavez, who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for Western Hemisphere Affairs during former President Barack Obama's administration and who is now at the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington. \"If the intent is to slow migration, this is going to have the opposite effect,\" she added. Speaking on ABC News' \"This Week\" program on Sunday, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said the United States needed more help from the \"Northern Triangle\" countries and Mexico, where the migrants typically enter the United States. \"You can make all the promises you want but when you're still sending 100,000 people across the southern border, actions speak louder than words,\" Mulvaney said. \"We want to work with the Northern Triangle countries but we need their assistance.\" Democrats were scathing about the planned cuts. \"Most of this aid is intended to address the causes of migration - reduce poverty, violence, gangs, improve rule of law, and reform justice systems,\" said Senator Patrick Leahy, the senior Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"It is shooting ourselves in the foot to cut off the assistance.\" (Reporting by Arshad Mohammed, Patricia Zengerle and Richard Cowan; Additional reporting by Jonathan Landay and Lesley Wroughton; Writing By Arshad Mohammed; Editing by Peter Cooney)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "patricia zengerle", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "arshad mohammed", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ric", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "richard cowan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cowan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "central america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tijuana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el salvador", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern triangle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guatemala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "honduras", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T04:26:01.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "529ed59ae704d20160eb556778b13f33b8b942c9", "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/u-marine-pilots-killed-weekend-crash-identified-mourned-000304300--finance.html/", "site_full": "news.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "U.S. Marine pilots killed in weekend crash recognized, mourned - ClickMag", "title_full": "U.S. Marine pilots killed in weekend crash recognized, mourned - ClickMag", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "MA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i0.wp.com/jbs.cu.ma/wp-content/uploads/U.S.-Marine-pilots-killed-in-weekend-crash-identified-mourned.png?resize=1000%2C600&#038;ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "529ed59ae704d20160eb556778b13f33b8b942c9", "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/u-marine-pilots-killed-weekend-crash-identified-mourned-000304300--finance.html/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "U.S. Marine pilots killed in weekend crash recognized, mourned - ClickMag", "text": "U.S. Marine pilots killed in weekend crash recognized, mourned\nBy Comment PHOENIX (Reuters) \u2013 The U.S. Marines on Monday recognized two helicopter pilots who have been killed over the weekend when their airship crashed in Arizona throughout coaching maneuvers, calling it a \u201csomber day\u201d for the service.

rebound Business Reuters Apr 02, 2019 07:05:28 IST\nBy Daniel Leussink\nTOKYO (Reuters) - Asia shares extended their rally on Tuesday as factory activity surveys from China and the United States boosted investor confidence, triggering the largest one-day sell-off in the U.S. Treasury market in nearly three months.\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3 percent to a seven-month high after rallying more than one percent in the previous session.\nAustralian shares gained 0.8 percent while Japan's Nikkei advanced 0.4 percent, extending its gains for a third session.\nWall Street shares jumped on Monday, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both rising more than one percent, with the Dow lifted by sharp gains in Caterpillar Inc and Boeing Co.\nInvestors cheered U.S. data overnight showing improvements in manufacturing activity last month and construction spending for February, which overshadowed an unexpected drop in retail sales.\nThe upbeat readings added to earlier data showing China's manufacturing sector surprisingly returned to growth for the first time in four months in March in a sign government stimulus steps were starting to be felt.\nThe rare bright news for the global economy comes in the wake of persistent worries over cooling demand across the world, with the Sino-U.S. tariff dispute, slowing trade and corporate profits prompting investors to dump risk assets over the past several months.\n\"The market is reacting to the improvement of the sentiment in China. Many investors are buying in anticipation of a rise in shares,\" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.\n\"But thinking about how things really are, at the end of the week (U.S.) jobless claims will be released and it's true that individual consumption, which accounts for 70 percent of gross domestic product, hasn't been good. I think that has to be taken into account,\" Fujito said.\nThe encouraging data on manufacturing activity in the world's two biggest economies led to a wobbly start to the U.S. bond market, with the U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields booking their largest single-day jump since Jan. 4.\nThe U.S. 10-year Treasury yield overnight jumped to a more than one-week high of 2.502 percent, moving off a 15-month low of 2.340 percent touched on March 25.\nThe rise pushed the yield curve between three-month U.S. Treasury bills and 10-year notes further into positive territory, after being inverted for a week until last Friday.\nBREXIT CHAOS\nIn the currency market, sterling took a knock after British lawmakers came no nearer to resolving the chaos surrounding the country's departure from the European Union.\nThe British parliament failed on Monday to find a majority of its own for any alternative to Prime Minister Theresa May's divorce deal.\n\"The only sensible thing for Theresa May to do is to step aside and let someone else take control of Brexit,\" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets in London.\n\"Failure to chose any of the options on Brexit took the floor under sterling and the currency stumbled like a rock,\" Aslam said in a note to clients.\nSterling was last down 0.25 percent at $1.3073, not far from last month's nadir of $1.2945.\nThe euro struggled near a three-week low of $1.1198 brushed early on Tuesday, and was last trading down a tenth of a percent at $1.1204.\nAgainst the Japanese yen, the dollar was down a tad at 111.33 yen, but 1.5 percent above its 1-1/2-month low of 109.70 touched on March 25.\nOil prices hovered near their four-month peaks, after two key benchmarks booked their largest first-quarter gains in nearly a decade on positive signs for the global economy and tighter supplies.\nU.S. crude futures traded at $61.92 per barrel, up half a percent on the day. Brent futures were up 0.4 percent at $69.28 a barrel.\nGold was 0.15 percent higher at $1,289.10.\n(Editing by Shri Navaratnam)\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.\n 05:28 IST Tags : Reuters ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "daniel leussink", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "boeing co", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "msci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caterpillar inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. treasury", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia-pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tokyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T04:37:51.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e354649797cc5abe171c61162a5b3e9aeac8f8c9", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/kuu1991kuu", "site_full": "twitcasting.tv", "site": "twitcasting.tv", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["television", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "\u304f\u3045 (@kuu1991kuu) 's Live - TwitCasting", "title_full": "\u304f\u3045 (@kuu1991kuu) 's Live - TwitCasting", "published": "2019-03-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://imagegw03.twitcasting.tv/image3/image.twitcasting.tv/image76_1/df/29/1ff029df-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2374, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e354649797cc5abe171c61162a5b3e9aeac8f8c9", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/kuu1991kuu", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-03-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "\u304f\u3045 (@kuu1991kuu) 's Live - TwitCasting", "text": "Title of work being infringed Details\nI read and understand the following notes and send this form.

Here's Why You Need to Pay Attention if You're Peeing a Lot at Night Maggie O'Neill What Is Nocturia? Here's Why You Need to Pay Attention if You're Peeing a Lot at Night More\nGetting up to urinate frequently at night could signal a serious health problem: high blood pressure .\nAccording to preliminary research\u2014presented at an annual meeting of the European Society of Cardiology\u2014salt intake and high blood pressure, also called hypertension, are both linked to an increased number of trips to the bathroom made when you should be sleeping. \u201cOur study indicates that if you need to urinate in the night\u2014called nocturia\u2014you may have elevated blood pressure and/or excess fluid in your body,\u201d study author Satoshi Konno, MD said in a press release.\nIf you consume too much salt, your body might retain fluid. This fluid retention is associated with high blood pressure, and it could mean you have to pee more in the middle of the night.\nBut hypertension isn\u2019t the only potential cause of nocturia. Below, you'll find three more potential reasons you're spending too much time in the bathroom when you should be in bed.\nRELATED: How Often Should You Pee a Day? A Doctor Weighs In You produce more urine at night than other people\nA condition called nocturnal polyuria could be the reason you can\u2019t sleep through the night without a bathroom break. \u201c Nocturnal polyuria is a syndrome where the usual day to night ratio of urine production is altered,\u201d according to a report from the American Society of Nephrology. Patients with nocturnal polyuria produce more than 33% of their daily urine output at night, the report says. Congestive heart failure , neurologic diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s, chronic kidney disease, and obstructive sleep apnea are some conditions that can lead to nocturnal polyuria.\nRELATED: 6 Natural Remedies for Anyone With Incontinence Your bladder isn't able to hold the amount of urine you produce at night\nIf this is the case, you have low nocturnal bladder capacity. A number of things can cause this, including infections and inflammation that make it so you need to empty your bladder frequently at night. Additionally, an overactive bladder or a bladder obstruction can cause low nocturnal bladder capacity. A report from the journal BMJ says many patients who suffer from nocturia are affected by both nocturnal polyuria and low nocturnal bladder capacity, which are two separate issues. Patients affected by both of these are diagnosed with mixed nocturia .\nRELATED: Why You Should Never Squat Over the Toilet Seat You just don't sleep very soundly\nSome people end up urinating frequently during the night because they simply wake up more often than they should . Because they\u2019re waking up more frequently, they\u2019re going to the bathroom more frequently\u2014but this doesn\u2019t necessarily have anything to do with their bladder health. \u201cTypically in these cases, it is not the need to void that awakens them,\u201d according to Cleveland Clinic. What to do if you're waking up to pee too often\nIf you find yourself losing sleep because of nocturia, talk to a doctor about potential causes. Urgent issues like infections will need to be treated. You might be asked to keep a \u201cfluid and voiding diary.\u201d This entails keeping a record of everything you drink and every time you have to go to the bathroom; the diary can help your doctor figure out what might be causing your nocturia.\nTreatment for nocturia might involve curing whatever ailment has led to the condition instead of curing the condition directly. If high blood pressure is causing your nocturia, for example, your doctor might recommend watching your salt intake or being more physically active.\nIf there's no underlying condition to address, a few simple lifestyle tweaks might help resolve your nocturia. Neil Grafstein, MD, an assistant professor of urology at New York City\u2019s Mount Sinai Hospital previously told Health that cutting back on the booze you drink when it\u2019s almost bedtime could put your nocturia symptoms to rest.\nAdditionally, drinking more water during the morning hours than in the evening could help. Lastly, cutting back on coffee might do the trick because caffeine irritates your bladder. We know this isn\u2019t the news you wanted to hear, but there\u2019s a possible silver lining: Maybe if you\u2019re getting better sleep you won\u2019t require as much coffee?

The S&P 500 as well as the NASDAQ had strong upside moves today with each of these indices gaining over a full percentage point.\nToday\u2019s rally in U.S. equities is in response to a strong global rally which began in China after the release of the Caixin China manufacturing purchasing managers index which rose from 49.9 in February to 50.8 in March.\nAccording to MarketWatch this was the first reading above 50 signaling an expansion and activity for the first time in four months. MarketWatch also reported that there was strong data in the U.S. from the Institute for supply management manufacturing index which revealed that activity in the United States greatly accelerated and came in stronger than expected at 55.3 in March versus a two year low of 54.2 a month earlier.\nOur technical studies indicate that there could be strong support for gold futures at $1291.60. This number is derived from the .38% Fibonacci retracement. This retracement covers a data set from $1196 up to $1350, which is the entire length of the last rally that began in mid-November of last year. The studies also indicate that current resistance resides between $1313 and $1314. This is based upon a Fibonacci retracement of .23%. This retracement number is from the same data set.\nConcerning palladium our technical studies indicate that there is strong support for palladium futures at $1306 per ounce. This support level is based upon the 100-day moving average. These studies also indicate current resistance in palladium futures at $1427.30 which is the 50-day moving average.\nFor those who would like more information, simply use this link .\nWishing you as always, good trading, ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gary wagner", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gary wag", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s equities pressures gold pricing", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "u.s equities pressures gold pricing | kitco news hawaii six o", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T04:50:10.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "98b40c7fc2cf2d1d2988433c8a34f12b9b7162e5", "url": "https://www.kitco.com/news/2019-04-01/U-S-considering-additional-Iran-sanctions-perhaps-in-May-U-S-official.html", "site_full": "www.kitco.com", "site": "kitco.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "U.S. considering additional Iran sanctions, perhaps in May: U.S. official | Kitco News", "title_full": "U.S. considering additional Iran sanctions, perhaps in May: U.S. official | Kitco News", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.037, "main_image": "http://www.kitco.com/images/kitco-news-social-share-logo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7841, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "98b40c7fc2cf2d1d2988433c8a34f12b9b7162e5", "url": "https://www.kitco.com/news/2019-04-01/U-S-considering-additional-Iran-sanctions-perhaps-in-May-U-S-official.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Http", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "U.S. considering additional Iran sanctions, perhaps in May: U.S. official | Kitco News", "text": "U.S. considering additional Iran sanctions, perhaps in May: U.S. official Reuters Monday April 01, 2019 16:57\nKitco News\nShare this article:\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States government is considering additional sanctions against Iran that would target areas of its economy that have not been hit before, a senior Trump administration official told reporters on Monday.\nThe official said the administration was aiming to follow through with the new sanctions around the anniversary of the U.S. withdrawal from a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and several world powers, which President Donald Trump announced last May.\nReporting by Jeff Mason; editing by Grant McCool Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and may not reflect those of Kitco Metals Inc.

There, the Fed proposed easier rules for smaller firms while ratcheting up requirements as banks got larger in size.\nHowever, Reuters reported in March the Fed was considering tighter rules on foreign bank branches over concerns they could allow overseas lenders to shield assets from the toughest U.S. bank rules.\nAfter the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed ordered foreign banks to place their non-branch U.S. assets into a new holding company, which would be subject to the same heightened post-crisis rules as domestic U.S. banks. Branches, however, fell outside that purview, as they are legally part of the overseas parent.\nOn resolution plans, otherwise known as \u201cliving wills,\u201d the Fed was given discretion under the new law to ease requirements for banks with less than $250 billion in assets. The Fed could reduce how often banks must submit the reports and otherwise ease requirements for the document, which details how a bank could safely be unwound.\nReporting by Pete Schroeder; Editing by James Dalgleish and Chris Reese Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and may not reflect those of Kitco Metals Inc.

But on Saturday the U.S. State Department said it was cutting off aid to those three countries.\nDetentions at the U.S. border have surged in recent months, angering Trump and putting pressure on Lopez Obrador to find a solution that will prevent a shutdown of the frontier to the market for 80 percent of Mexico's exports.\nAsked if it was time to put pressure on the Central American countries to do more to tackle the problem, Lopez Obrador said the causes of migration were \\\"not being attended to\\\" and that people needed to be offered more opportunities there.\n\\\"Obviously, we have to help because Central American migrants pass through our territory and we have to bring order to this migration, make sure it's legal,\\\" he said.\n\\\"That's what we're doing. But serenely, calmly, without a commotion and with great prudence and responsibility.\\\"\nMexico began issuing temporary humanitarian visas to some members of a migrant caravan in southern Mexico, giving priority to children and the elderly, the National Migration Institute said Monday. It said it would provide transport back to Central American countries, Cuba and Haiti, on a voluntary basis.\nEarlier this year, Mexico handed out humanitarian visas liberally, but reined in the program after a surge in applications. The institute said from next month it was planning to encourage people to apply for visas in their home countries.\nIt was not immediately clear if the government was limiting the number of visas it issues.\nU.S. CONGRESSIONAL OBJECTIONS\nIt has quickly become clear that any plan to cut aid to Central America would face strong objections from members of the U.S. Congress, who must approve it.\nOne of Trump's fellow Republicans, Representative Mike McCaul, the top Republican on the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, said cutting aid would worsen the situation.\n\\\"If we cut all this funding ... I think it's going to make things tragically worse, not better,\\\" he said during a presentation at a think tank in Washington.\nPutting a stop to aid to Central America made the job of stemming the flow of migrants tougher, said Senator Ben Cardin, a senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\\\"And closing the border - that makes no sense at all,\\\" he told CNN. \\\"We need Mexico's cooperation to work with us, and cutting off the border just tells Mexico: 'We're doing it alone'.\\\"\nFollowing a meeting on Monday with Lopez Obrador at the Presidential Palace in Mexico City, the Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Eliot Engel, invited the Mexican president to visit the committee in Washington.\nAn aide to Engel said the panel would hold a hearing on the issues.\n\\\"Excellent meeting with President @lopezobrador_ on importance of U.S.-#Mexico relationship. I emphasized need to partner in assisting Central America,\\\" Engel said on Twitter.\nMexico's Ambassador to the United States, Martha Barcena, said that the issues of \\\"development cooperation, fighting corruption in Mexico, need for friendly and constructive bilateral relations\\\" were discussed.\nU.S. Border Patrol projections are for over 90,000 apprehensions at the border during March, according to data provided to the Mexican government - a more than 140 percent increase from March 2018, and a seven-fold jump from 2017.\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States was working with the Central American governments and Mexico and pointed to the numbers when asked why Trump had toughened his stance.\n\\\"Just look at the math,\\\" Pompeo told reporters outside the U.S. Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. \\\"How many folks are coming across.

REUTERS/Issei Kato Reuters\nBy Daniel Leussink\nTOKYO (Reuters) - Asia shares extended their rally on Tuesday as factory activity surveys from China and the United States boosted investor confidence, triggering the largest one-day sell-off in the U.S. Treasury market in nearly three months.\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3 percent to a seven-month high after rallying more than one percent in the previous session.\nAustralian shares gained 0.8 percent while Japan's Nikkei advanced 0.4 percent, extending its gains for a third session.\nWall Street shares jumped on Monday, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both rising more than one percent, with the Dow lifted by sharp gains in Caterpillar Inc and Boeing Co.\nInvestors cheered U.S. data overnight showing improvements in manufacturing activity last month and construction spending for February, which overshadowed an unexpected drop in retail sales.\nThe upbeat readings added to earlier data showing China's manufacturing sector surprisingly returned to growth for the first time in four months in March in a sign government stimulus steps were starting to be felt.\nThe rare bright news for the global economy comes in the wake of persistent worries over cooling demand across the world, with the Sino-U.S. tariff dispute, slowing trade and corporate profits prompting investors to dump risk assets over the past several months.\n\"The market is reacting to the improvement of the sentiment in China. Many investors are buying in anticipation of a rise in shares,\" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.\n\"But thinking about how things really are, at the end of the week (U.S.) jobless claims will be released and it's true that individual consumption, which accounts for 70 percent of gross domestic product, hasn't been good.

The project is the result of a three-company co-operative project called Hipercar (High-Performance Carbon Reduction), and is backed by a two-million-pound grant from Innovate UK, a government technology agency.\nIn terms of specifications, the car will be monocoque chassis with carbon-fibre body panels (including a cockpit) to keep the weight at around 1,600 kg. The P40 will feature four separate electric motors, each producing 295 hp, with power being supplied by a 42-kWh liquid-cooled battery.\nAside from the all-wheel drive model, a slower two-wheel drive version with a larger 56-kWh battery is also claimed to be offered. A 35-kW turbine range extended over the rear axle will be fitted on both models to keep the batteries supplied with power, once the initial electric range of up to 193 km is used.\nIn terms of eye-watering numbers, four-motor version has a total system output of torque. To ensure order, advanced electronic traction control and torque vectoring systems are deployed, along with a regenerative braking function.\nAriel predicts a zero to 100 km/h sprint time of just 2.4 seconds, while zero to 160 km/h (0-100 mph) will take just 3.8 seconds.

It argues for extending the 2011 treaty, which expires in February 2021 but can be extended for five years if both sides agree.\nThe Trump administration is deliberating whether to extend the pact, which President Donald Trump has reviled as a bad deal and his national security adviser, John Bolton, has long opposed. Russia has said it is prepared to extend New START but wants to discuss what it regards as U.S. violations first.\nThe State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the administration's deliberations.\nTrump has said Washington will withdraw from another arms pact, the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, this summer unless Moscow ends its alleged violations, compounding tense ties. Russia denies violating the INF treaty.\nThe New START treaty required the United States and Russia to cut their deployed strategic nuclear warheads to no more than 1,550, the lowest level in decades, and limit delivery systems - land- and submarine-based missiles and nuclear-capable bombers.\nIt also includes extensive transparency measures requiring each side to allow the other to carry out 10 inspections of strategic nuclear bases each year; give 48 hours notice before new missiles covered by the treaty leave their factories; and provide notifications before ballistic missile launches.\nBoth sides must also exchange data declaring their deployed strategic nuclear warheads, delivery vehicles and launchers, as well as breakdowns of how many of each are located at individual bases.\nAll of that would end if the treaty expires.\n\\\"Neither country would have the same degree of confidence in its ability to assess the other's precise warhead levels,\\\" CNA's Vince Manzo wrote in the study (https://bit.ly/2JUdSvW). \\\"Worst-case planning is also more likely as a result.\n\\\"Increased opacity between U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear forces would unfold within the broader context of growing mistrust and diverging perceptions about strategy, intentions, and perceptions,\\\" he added.\nWithout the data, the United States would have to reassign its overworked satellites, possibly devoting more surveillance to Russia and less to China, Iran and North Korea.\nAnother casualty of the treaty's expiration could be global nonproliferation, making non-nuclear states doubt the United States and Russia will keep working toward nuclear disarmament under the NPT, the study said.\nWhile it was impossible to predict how China - estimated to have about 280 nuclear warheads - would react to New START's expiry, the study cites factors that could make Beijing expand its capability.\nWithout a treaty limiting U.S. and Russian nuclear forces, China could overestimate their arsenals. Unconstrained U.S. and Russian forces could also strengthen voices in China that view a large arsenal as symbolically important, as well as those already advocating for more nuclear weapons.\nThe study recommends steps for the United States and Russia to mitigate the risks from the treaty's expiration, including voluntarily sticking to its limits and continuing to exchange data. It also recommends Washington propose annual exchanges of nuclear weapons information and dialogue with Beijing.\n(Reporting by Arshad Mohammed and Jonathan Landay; Editing by Mary Milliken and Dan Grebler)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bit.ly/2JUdSvW)."], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john bolton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cna corp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T04:56:21.035+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1a145305c8d4e48b5136753332deda9da2689f24", "url": "http://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2019/04/02/exclusive-us-sends-message-to-turkey-halts-f35-equipment-shipments--sources/", "site_full": "www.thestar.com.my", "site": "thestar.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.thestar.com.my/News/World/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Malaysia News: National, Regional and World News | The Star Online", "title": "Exclusive: U.S. sends message to Turkey, halts F-35 equipment shipments - sources", "title_full": "Exclusive: U.S. sends message to Turkey, halts F-35 equipment shipments - sources - World | The Star Online", "published": "2019-04-01T13:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.397, "main_image": "https://www.thestar.com.my/~/media/online/2019/04/01/18/57/20190401t185302z_1_lynxnpef302if_rtroptp_4_usaturkeyf35.ashx/?w=620&amp;h=413&amp;crop=1&amp;hash=5647063B6E872439F8356E5CD8F6AE63B6BB7E3A", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4704, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1a145305c8d4e48b5136753332deda9da2689f24", "url": "http://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2019/04/02/exclusive-us-sends-message-to-turkey-halts-f35-equipment-shipments--sources/", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "thestar.com.my", "published": "2019-04-01T13:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Exclusive: U.S. sends message to Turkey, halts F-35 equipment shipments - sources", "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has halted delivery of equipment related to the stealthy F-35 fighter aircraft to Turkey, sources familiar with the situation said, marking the first concrete U.S. step to block delivery of the jet to the NATO ally in light of Ankara's planned purchase of a Russian missile defence system.\nIn recent days, U.S. officials told their Turkish counterparts they will not receive further shipments of F-35 related equipment needed to prepare for the arrival of the stealthy jet, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters. The aircraft is built by Lockheed Martin Corp.\nThe sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the next shipment of training equipment, and all subsequent shipments of F-35 related material, have been cancelled.\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan has refused to back down from Ankara's planned purchase of a Russian S-400 missile defence system that the United States has said would compromise the security of F-35 aircraft. Turkey has said it will take delivery of the S-400s in July.\nThe disagreement over the F-35 is the latest of a series of diplomatic disputes between the United States and Turkey including Turkish demands that the United States extradite Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, differences over Middle East policy and the war in Syria, and sanctions on Iran.\nA Pentagon official had told Reuters in March that the United States had a number of items it could withhold in order to send Turkey a signal that the United States was serious about Ankara dropping its ambition to own the S-400.\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Turkish officials in Ankara were not immediately available for comment.\nThe U.S. decision on the F-35s was expected to complicate Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu's planned visit to Washington this week for a NATO summit. The latest development in the F-35 dispute came a day after Erdogan suffered one of his biggest electoral losses in decades in local elections.\nReuters reported last week that Washington was exploring whether it could remove Turkey from production of the F-35. Turkey makes parts of the fuselage, landing gear and cockpit displays. Sources familiar with the F-35's intricate worldwide production process and U.S. thinking on the issue last week said Turkey's role can be replaced.\nThe United States and other NATO allies that own F-35s fear the radar on the Russian S-400 missile system will learn how to spot and track the jet, making it less able to evade Russian weapons in the future.\nIn an attempt to persuade Turkey to drop its plans to buy the S-400, the United States offered the pricier American-made Patriot anti-missile system in a discounted deal that expired at the end of March. Turkey has shown interest in the Patriot system, but not at the expense of abandoning the S-400.\nTurkey has engaged with U.S. negotiators in recent days about buying the Patriot system, a person familiar with the matter said. The system is made by Raytheon Co.\nTurkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar in March said that despite some issues, Turkish pilots were continuing their training at an air base in Arizona on the F-35, each of which costs $90 million, and that Ankara was expecting the aircraft to arrive in Turkey in November.\nU.S. lawmakers also have expressed alarm over Turkey's planned purchase of the Russian system.

REUTERS/Edgard Garrido/File Photo By Dave Graham MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico will help to regulate the flow of Central American migrants passing through its territory to the United States, but the root causes behind the phenomenon must be tackled, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday. Speaking after U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to close the U.S. southern border if Mexico did not halt illegal immigration immediately, Lopez Obrador said he would not have a confrontation with the United States. \"I prefer love and peace,\" Lopez Obrador told reporters at his regular morning news conference. The leftist president has consistently refused to get drawn into a war of words with Trump over the border. A senior Mexican trade official warned later that closing down the U.S.-Mexico border would cause pain on \"both sides.\" Most of the people caught at the frontier trying to enter the United States illegally come from three violent and impoverished countries: Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Lopez Obrador has tried to persuade Trump to address the problem by fostering economic development in Central America. But on Saturday the U.S. State Department said it was cutting off aid to those three countries. [nL1N21H083] Detentions at the U.S. border have surged in recent months, angering Trump and putting pressure on Lopez Obrador to find a solution that will prevent a shutdown of the frontier to the market for 80 percent of Mexico's exports. [nL1N21H06L] Asked if it was time to put pressure on the Central American countries to do more to tackle the problem, Lopez Obrador said the causes of migration were \"not being attended to\" and that people needed to be offered more opportunities there. \"Obviously, we have to help because Central American migrants pass through our territory and we have to bring order to this migration, make sure it's legal,\" he said. \"That's what we're doing. But serenely, calmly, without a commotion and with great prudence and responsibility.\" Mexico began issuing temporary humanitarian visas to some members of a migrant caravan in southern Mexico, giving priority to children and the elderly, the National Migration Institute said Monday. It said it would provide transport back to Central American countries, Cuba and Haiti, on a voluntary basis. Earlier this year, Mexico handed out humanitarian visas liberally, but reined in the program after a surge in applications. The institute said from next month it was planning to encourage people to apply for visas in their home countries. It was not immediately clear if the government was limiting the number of visas it issues. U.S. CONGRESSIONAL OBJECTIONS It has quickly become clear that any plan to cut aid to Central America would face strong objections from members of the U.S. Congress, who must approve it. One of Trump's fellow Republicans, Representative Mike McCaul, the top Republican on the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, said cutting aid would worsen the situation. \"If we cut all this funding ... I think it's going to make things tragically worse, not better,\" he said during a presentation at a think tank in Washington. Putting a stop to aid to Central America made the job of stemming the flow of migrants tougher, said Senator Ben Cardin, a senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \"And closing the border - that makes no sense at all,\" he told CNN. \"We need Mexico's cooperation to work with us, and cutting off the border just tells Mexico: 'We're doing it alone'.\" Following a meeting on Monday with Lopez Obrador at the Presidential Palace in Mexico City, the Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Eliot Engel, invited the Mexican president to visit the committee for a meeting in Washington, an aide to Engel said. \"Excellent meeting with President @lopezobrador_ on importance of U.S.-#Mexico relationship. I emphasized need to partner in assisting Central America,\" Engel said on Twitter. Mexico's Ambassador to the United States, Martha Barcena, said that the issues of \"development cooperation, fighting corruption in Mexico, need for friendly and constructive bilateral relations\" were discussed. U.S. Border Patrol projections are for over 90,000 apprehensions at the border during March, according to data provided to the Mexican government - a more than 140 percent increase from March 2018, and a seven-fold jump from 2017. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States was working with the Central American governments and Mexico and pointed to the numbers when asked why Trump had toughened his stance. \"Just look at the math,\" Pompeo told reporters outside the U.S. Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. \"How many folks are coming across. This is a crisis. We need to fix it.\" (This story corrects paragraph 20 to show Engel invited Lopez Obrador for a meeting, not a hearing) (Reporting by Dave Graham; Additional reporting by Sharay Angulo and Anthony Esposito in Mexico City and Lesley Wroughton, Doina Chiacu and Patricia Zengerle in Washington; editing by Grant McCool, James Dalgleish and Sonya Hepinstall)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dave graham reblog", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "andres manuel lopez obrador", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lopez obrador", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave graham", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national palace", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national palace", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T04:56:52.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5698c41135dfc5ae6370fc337f48ef54a62c817f", "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/u-lawmaker-invites-mexico-president-congress-migration-talks-011833549.html", "site_full": "news.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "http://rss.news.yahoo.com/rss/business\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines", "title": "U.S. lawmaker invites Mexico president to Congress after migration talks", "title_full": "U.S. lawmaker invites Mexico president to Congress after migration talks", "published": "2019-04-02T04:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eYWKfkqsIK9ddgW.HkoPow--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2019-04-02T011833Z_1_LYNXNPEF3101V_RTROPTP_2_USA-CLIMATE-GREENNEWDEAL.JPG", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5698c41135dfc5ae6370fc337f48ef54a62c817f", "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/u-lawmaker-invites-mexico-president-congress-migration-talks-011833549.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T04:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "U.S. lawmaker invites Mexico president to Congress after migration talks", "text": "FILE PHOTO - U.S. Representative Eliot Engel (D-NY) speaks during the introduction of the Climate Action Now Act on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., March 27, 2019.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock markets were little changed on Tuesday after touching a six-month high as investors took a breather following a three-day run of gains while oil prices continued to climb amid the increased possibility of tightening supply. MSCI's key gauge of global equities had rallied 1.1% on Monday, its best performance in three weeks, as manufacturing data in China and the United States put recession worries at bay. On Tuesday, the index held close to the unchanged mark for most of the session. Major U.S. indexes were little changed, although the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average was dragged down by a slump of 12.58% in Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc after the drugstore chain cut its 2019 profit growth forecast. Economic data did little to stunt growth worries. New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods slipped in February and shipments were unchanged, but data for January was revised slightly higher, which could support views that the manufacturing sector was stabilizing in the wake of the data on Monday. \"We've gotten to a place and time where we are going to need new evidence to move this market higher,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York. \"Incrementally better-than-expected data might move this market higher, which was not the case in today's durable goods number.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 105.98 points, or 0.4%, to 26,152.44, the S&P 500 lost 1.96 points, or 0.07%, to 2,865.23 and the Nasdaq Composite added 12.16 points, or 0.16%, to 7,841.07. After a sluggish start, European shares built some late momentum to close at their highest level in six months, helped by gains in insurers and automakers. Europe was led by a jump of 1% in London's FTSE 100 index as sterling weakened. That came as the European Union said Britain could be heading for a potentially disorderly exit in 10 days as Prime Minister Theresa May met with ministers to work out ways to break the Brexit deadlock. But sterling reversed course following the close of European indexes, after May said Britain needed a further extension to ensure it leaves the European Union with a deal in a timely manner. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.35%. The dollar index rose 0.16%, with the euro down 0.15% to $1.1195. Sterling was last trading at $1.3106, up 0.05% on the day. For a graphic on No deal Brexit probabilities, see - https://tmsnrt.rs/2CPfG3j The Brexit concerns also pushed yields on U.S. Treasuries lower from one-week highs as investors looking for bargains and a safe-haven bid stepped in. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 5/32 in price to yield 2.4813%, from 2.497% late on Monday. Oil prices continued to rally, with crude prices hitting their highest levels of the year and Brent moving closer to the $70 a barrel mark for the first time since mid-November. The gains came on the prospect of more sanctions against Iran and further Venezuelan disruptions that could deepen an OPEC-led supply cut. U.S. crude rose 1.33% to $62.41 per barrel and Brent was last at $69.20, up 0.28% on the day.

Humvee is de merknaam die gebruikt wordt door AMGeneral. De Humvee en de Hummer H1 rollen / rolden van dezelfde band in de fabriek van AMGeneral. De Hummer H2 en H3 kwamen uit fabrieken van General Motors. In 2009 maakt GM bekend dat het merk Hummer niet langer meer door GM gevoerd zal worden. Voor circa 8000 medewerkers zal ontslag worden aangevraagd. Op 2 juni 2009 maakt General Motors bekend dat Hummer zal worden overgenomen door het Chinese bedrijf Sichuan Tengzhong. Dit blijkt op 24 februari niet door te gaan; de Chinese regering zou het bedrijf niet de vereiste toestemming geven voor de transactie. Hiermee verdwijnt het merk 'Hummer'. De Humvee zal echter wel geproduceerd blijven worden.

The Bolstering Long-Term Understanding and Exploration of the Great Lakes, Oceans, Bays, and Estuaries Act, or the BLUE GLOBE Act, would accelerate technology innovation, grow the marine workforce, and develop a better understanding of the blue economy.\n\u201cWe know more about the surface of the moon than we do about our own oceans,\u201d said Senator Whitehouse . \u201cSenator Murkowski and I have proposed a bipartisan bill to help give the oceans the attention they are due. It\u2019s time to invest in research, technology, and a future workforce that will shape a better understanding of our seas, Great Lakes, and coasts.\u201d\n\u201cOur oceans are one of the Earth\u2019s most valuable resources. With the growth of the ocean economy projected to outpace the global economy, this is an opportunity that our nation must capitalize on. But in order to do so we need to invest in the necessary technology to produce reliable data and observations that will allow us to strategically link economic growth and stewardship of our oceans, bays, lakes, and estuaries. This will open the door to increasing Alaska\u2019s sustainable seafood production, support our coastal communities and residents, and develop stronger transportation, recreation, and energy production,\u201d said Senator Murkowski. \u201cI\u2019m proud to introduce this legislation to help ensure we have robust, reliable information to foster the development of our blue economy.\u201d\nThe BLUE GLOBE Act would charge existing federal ocean-focused interagency committees to improve domestic and international coordination and enhance data management and accessibility. It would also establish an Interagency Ocean Exploration Committee to promote exploration and monitoring of the oceans. The legislation would ensure a high-level ocean committee will continue in the Office of the President, regardless of the administration.\nThe BLUE GLOBE Act would accelerate ocean data and monitoring innovation by giving new and existing NOAA Cooperative Institutes a stronger focus on technology advancement. It creates a new innovation prize, and tasks the National Academy of Sciences with assessing the potential for an Advanced Research Project Agency\u2013Oceans (ARPA-O). The legislation would launch a new Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing Tech Force, to coordinate the development of technologies to address IUU fishing. This measure follows on successful work of the Oceans Caucus to support the passage of four international agreements aimed at combatting IUU fishing and the related enabling legislation.\nThe BLUE GLOBE Act reauthorizes a number of NOAA programs and directs heads of relevant federal agencies to more accurately measure the value of the Blue Economy. It also looks to indigenous, subsistence, and fishing communities as a source of ocean information. The bill calls for the creation of a workforce development program to support undergraduate, graduate, and informal education in fields relevant to ocean data and monitoring.\n\"I'm pleased that Congress recognizes the value of ocean observations and data to the nation's national security and economy,\u201d said Molly McCammon, Executive Director of the Alaska Ocean Observing System. \u201cIn Alaska, which has the nation's largest coastal boundary including the Arctic, we need to ensure all agencies, private parties, including the Alaska Ocean Observing System, are working collaboratively to provide the best data possible for decision making in an environment of rapid change.\"\n\u201cWe are excited to see the BLUE GLOBE Act focus on the importance of monitoring and observations for our oceans, coasts and Great Lakes,\u201d said Debra Hernandez , Chair of the IOOS Association. \u201cObservations provide us with the basic information to understand the changes that are occurring and to develop the information, alerts and assessment necessary for fishermen, emergency managers, rescue personal, resource managers, shippers and the general public. The BLUE GLOBE Act supports the Integrated Ocean Observing System and other observing and technology efforts by enhancing coordination, encouraging innovation and supporting information technology.\u201d\n\u201cImproved data collection and collaboration is paramount to protecting and preserving the world\u2019s oceans,\u201d said Johan Bergenas , Senior Director for Public Policy at Vulcan Inc. , a technology leader in the effort to identify and combat IUU fishing. \u201cThe BLUE GLOBE Act will help guard our water resources by ramping up technology innovation and increasing data collection and collaboration across agencies. Vulcan commends Senators Whitehouse and Murkowski for their leadership on these issues, which are vital to American and global prosperity.\u201d\nThe bipartisan Senate Oceans Caucus works to find common ground in responding to issues facing the oceans and coasts, which support millions of jobs in America. The Oceans Caucus has focused on ending illegal fishing, reducing marine debris, and improving ocean data and monitoring. Whitehouse and Murkowski founded the Caucus in 2011. It currently has 41 members.

the on-going diplomatic efforts to achieve a complete denuclearization of and peace on the Korean Peninsula, according to a statement released by the Pentagon.\nThe two defense chiefs vowed to remain \"an unwavering combined readiness posture,\" said the statement.\nThey also pledged to enhance coordination and cooperation in various areas including information sharing on issues regarding the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), it added.\nJeong's visit came one month after the second summit between the top DPRK leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump in late February in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi that ended without an agreement.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in, who is scheduled to visit Washington next week, said Monday that Pyongyang and Washington have shown their determination to continue the dialogue by managing situations stably so as not to increase tensions as seen in the past.\nMoon vowed to make efforts to help resume denuclearization negotiations between the DPRK and the United States.\nThe Korean Peninsula's peace process would become a journey, taken jointly by the two Koreas and the United States that would not be easy, he said.\nEarlier last month, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lu Kang said at a press conference that no one should expect the Korean Peninsula issue to be resolved in just one day, and the key is to take into account the legitimate concerns of all parties in a balanced way and consolidate mutual trust and gradually gather consensus.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

in 914 days.\nKang started on the bench in the Pirates' home opener of the 2019 Major League Baseball season against the St. Louis Cardinals at PNC Park in Pittsburgh on Monday (Korean time) after Colin Moran took over his third base position. But with the game tied at 4-4, the 31-year-old South Korean came on in the top of the eighth inning to play third base, with Moran switching to first base.\nIt was Kang's first appearance at PNC Park since Sept. 29, 2016, when he played against the Chicago Cubs.\nKang missed the entire 2017 season while dealing with legal problems in South Korea.\nHe was arrested in Seoul after leaving the scene of a drunk driving accident in December 2016 and was slapped with a suspended jail term the following spring. Unable to secure his U.S. work permit, he sat out all of 2017 and only appeared in three big league games away from home in 2018.\nAfter Moran bashed a solo-run in the bottom of the eighth and made the score 5-4, Kang made his home plate appearance against the Cardinals' reliever Mike Mayers, but flew out to center.\nThe Cardinals later leveled the score in the top of the ninth and sent the game into extra innings. In the bottom of the 10th, Kang faced Jordan Hicks, but he struck out on three pitches.\nWith the latest performance, Kang's batting average went down to .222. The Pirates went on to lose the game 6-5.\nIn this UPI photo, Pittsburgh Pirates infielder Kang Jung-ho (L) greets his teammates before the start of the home opener with St. Louis Cardinals at PNC Park on April 1, 2019, in Pittsburgh, U.S. (Yonhap)\nkdon@yna.co.kr\n(END)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kang jung-ho", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "colin moran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moran", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "yonhap", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "korean pirates", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pnc park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago cubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pirates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "major league baseball", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. louis cardinals", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pittsburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pnc park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T05:22:02.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0bdf7d98de51b7b51c592a1ec6d1ece9b298da4b", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1982967441", "site_full": "www.goodreads.com", "site": "goodreads.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["books_and_literature", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "bea (Switzerland)\u2019s review of Defy Me", "title_full": "bea (Switzerland)\u2019s review of Defy Me", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.085, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 300, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0bdf7d98de51b7b51c592a1ec6d1ece9b298da4b", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1982967441", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tahereh Mafi", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "bea (Switzerland)\u2019s review of Defy Me", "text": "photo Flag Abuse Flagging a post will send it to the Goodreads Customer Care team for review.

Shipping along the largest oil port in the United States remained disrupted on Monday, as did operations at two nearby refineries.\nFumes from benzene-containing fuel and fear of another fire have prevented investigators from going into the tank farm's \"hot zone,\" officials said Monday. Three tanks holding oils remain to be emptied this week, and responders continue to sop up fuels on the tank farm grounds.\nInvestigators from the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as state and local authorities, plan to enter the site once it is safe.\nAccess to the site, along the Houston Ship Channel, will help determine what happened and how a fire at one tank holding tens of thousands of barrels of naphtha spread quickly to 10 other giant tanks.\n\"The escalation of the event, looking at how the fire spread from a single tank to others in the tank battery, is certainly something we're interested in,\" said CSB lead investigator Mark Wingard, who arrived in Houston last week.\nBefore CSB investigators enter the site, possibly later this week, they will focus on interviewing ITC personnel and witnesses of the fire, and collecting documentation on the facility and its tanks. The CSB's investigation will also examine the \"outside impacts\" of the fires, Wingard said.\n\"There's huge public interest in this case,\" he said. \"People in this community want to know what happened and what they were exposed to.\"\nAccess also could provide officials with information critical to state and local lawsuits accusing the company of improperly releasing tons of volatile organic compounds into the surrounding air and water.\n\"We need to get to what was the root cause of this event and then begin to understand any aspect of negligence or obstruction that led to the event,\" Harris County Commissioner Adri\u00e1n Garc\u00eda said in an interview.\nThe county last week filed a lawsuit against ITC seeking to recoup the costs of emergency responders and healthcare clinics set up in response to pollution from the fire. The county has not yet estimated the cost, which Garcia said is \"going to be very significant.\"\nAn ITC spokeswoman declined to comment, citing pending litigation. In the past, a company official said ITC responded immediately to the fire and had no lack of resources to put out the fire.\nAsked how long it would take for investigators to get onto the grounds, ITC Senior Vice President Brent Weber said he hoped it would be days not weeks. \"They have been on the site,\" Weber said on Monday. \"They're staying out of the hot zone right now.\"\nFumes and clean-up efforts continued to affect shipping for a third week. Twenty-two cargo vessels were able to transit the area near the ITC tank farm on Sunday, the Coast Guard said, between 40 percent and 50 percent of normal.\nAnother 64 were in a queue waiting to pass on Monday.

The United States is battling an epidemic of opioid-related deaths, and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has said he hopes to include China's commitments to curb the drug in any agreement to end the two countries' bitter trade war. \"This significant development will eliminate Chinese drug traffickers' ability to alter fentanyl compounds to get around the law,\" the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency said in a statement. \"We look forward to our continued collaboration with China to reduce the amount of this deadly poison coming into our country,\" the DEA statement said. Earlier on Monday, China had announced the expanded control of all fentanyl-related substances at a press conference, even as it blamed U.S. culture for abuse of the drug. China said the addition of fentanyl-related substances to the supplementary list of controlled narcotic drugs will take effect on May 1. Fentanyl itself and its \"analogues\" had previously been listed and remain controlled. The drug in its illegal form has gone by street names, including China White, China Girl, and Dance Fever, according to the U.S. government. It is a highly addictive painkiller many times more potent than morphine. \"Resolved. All resolved,\" Liu Yuejin, a senior public security ministry official and vice commissioner of the China National Narcotics Control Commission, told reporters when asked if U.S. concerns had been resolved. But Liu said the amount of fentanyl from China going to the United States was \"extremely limited\" and that U.S. criticisms of China being the main source of the drug \"lack evidence\". \"We believe that the United States itself is the main factor in the abuse of fentanyl there,\" Liu said, adding that American culture was partly to blame. He said the United States had a long tradition of abusing prescription medicines and that enforcement and education about the dangers were not good enough. \"Some people link drug consumption with freedom, individuality, and liberation,\" Liu said. \"If the United States truly wants to resolve its fentanyl abuse problem, it needs to strengthen its domestic work.\" Chinese officials in the past year have vowed to step up cooperation with Washington on illegal drug production and sales, referring to it as a bright spot in relations. The White House said after a December meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Argentina to deescalate trade frictions that Xi had agreed to designate fentanyl as a controlled substance. U.S. Representative Chris Smith, a Republican, said enforcement is crucial. \"We have heard soothing but empty rhetoric before from China's leaders ... so we must continue to monitor developments closely and hold Chinese officials and manufacturers accountable if they fail to take decisive action and enforce this new policy,\" he said in a statement. Trump has called on China to apply the death penalty for \"distributors and pushers\" of the synthetic opioid. The volume of drugs coming into the United States through the mail has grown in step with legitimate online shopping, U.S. customs agents say, as Americans have taken to ordering drugs from overseas via the dark web. A U.S. congressional probe into the use of fentanyl in the United States found in 2018 that the substance could easily be bought online from Chinese \"labs\" and mailed to the United States due to gaps in oversight in the U.S. Postal Service. Such imports of prescription medicines and controlled substances are illegal, and China has become the main source of fentanyl in the United States, the U.S. Department of Justice says.

Failure to get France on board would mean the EU\u2019s executive arm won\u2019t be given a mandate to negotiate.\nThe main sticking points include the role of climate and environment in the mandate given the U.S. decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord and a clarification of what this negotiation would mean for the shelved Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, according to the officials.\nA draft mandate prepared ahead of the meeting of ambassadors and seen by Bloomberg reiterates that the EU seeks trade accords only with countries that have signed up to the Paris agreement against climate change, even though the U.S. has pulled out.\nThe EU has been trying to kick start trade deliberations with the U.S. in a bid to show President Trump progress in enacting a political accord that he reached with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in July. That agreement helped put on hold the American threat of tariffs on European cars and auto parts.\nWashington has shown frustration over the lack of progress since, with U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland saying in a February interview that \u201cso long as the EU leadership plays the delay game the more we will have to use leverage to realign the relationship.\u201d\nEU-U.S. Trade Talks Face Delay, Risking Trump Backlash", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=179222828858436&u=https%3A%2F%2Fza.investing.com%2Fnews%2Feconomy-news%2Feuus-trade-talks-face-delay-risking-trump-backlash-1440515&display=popup&ref=plugin", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fza.investing.com%2Fnews%2Feconomy-news%2Feuus-trade-talks-face-delay-risking-trump-backlash-1440515&title=EU-U.S.+Trade+Talks+Face+Delay%2C+Risking+Trump+Backlash&summary=", "https://invst.ly/afnbh"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "risking trump backlash \u00a9 reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "transatlantic trade and investment partnership", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T05:32:55.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "12f925a40778815c8868ee4a564de83f6f78df63", "url": "https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?oid=001&aid=0010734487", "site_full": "news.naver.com", "site": "naver.com", "site_section": "https://openapi.naver.com/v1/search/news?query=a&start=9&sort=date&display=100", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "", "title": "(2nd LD) S Korea-extra budget : \ub274\uc2a4", "title_full": "(2nd LD) S Korea-extra budget : \ub124\uc774\ubc84 \ub274\uc2a4", "published": "2019-04-02T05:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "KR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://imgnews.pstatic.net/image/origin/001/2019/04/02/10734487.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 89, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "12f925a40778815c8868ee4a564de83f6f78df63", "url": "https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?oid=001&aid=0010734487", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4 | \ub124\uc774\ubc84", "published": "2019-04-02T05:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "(2nd LD) S Korea-extra budget : \ub274\uc2a4", "text": "(2nd LD) Gov't to draw up extra budget in April over fine dust, economic slowdown\n(ATTN: ADDS more info, background in 6-13)\nSEOUL, April 2 (Yonhap) -- The government plans to draw up an extra budget in April to cope with fine dust and boost the slowing economy and job creation, officials said Tuesday.\nThe decision was made at a meeting among senior officials from the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae, the government and the ruling Democratic Party (DP) to discuss ways to tackle an economic downturn and other issues.\n\"The International Monetary Fund has proposed that South Korea draw up a supplementary budget, citing downside factors.

Cho Jeong-sik, key DP policymaker, proposed that the government set aside at least 1 trillion won for expenditure on fine dust pollution in a possible extra budget.\nA supplementary budget is subject to parliamentary approval.\nLast year, South Korea's parliament approved an extra budget bill of 3.83 trillion won to create jobs for young people and help industrial regions grappling with massive layoffs.\nThe National Assembly passed a bill that designates fine dust as a social disaster last month as the country struggles to reduce fine dust, a large portion of which is believed to originate in China.\nParticipants in Tuesday's trilateral meeting agreed to push to set up infrastructure that can measure, monitor and analyze fine dust and devise ways to reduce the emission of fine dust if the budget is approved.\nThey also discussed ways to provide assistance to the southeastern city of Pohang, which was hit by a strong earthquake in 2017.\nA state-led investigation team said last month that the Pohang quake, the country's second-most destructive earthquake, was probably triggered by an experimental geothermal power plant that harnesses energy from the ground.\nIn November 2017, a 5.4 magnitude earthquake struck Pohang, injuring nearly 120 people and causing property damage worth 84.6 billion won.\nThe officials agreed to push for enacting a special law on the Pohang quake and forming a special committee tasked with looking into the incident.\nKim Soo-hyun, senior presidential secretary for policy, vowed efforts to take necessary actions to prop up the economy.\n\"The government will spur efforts to revitalize the economy,\" he said. \"We will make all-out efforts to boost key manufacturers that are in the midst of a slowdown and venture firms.\"\nPrime Minister Lee Nak-yon (2nd from R) speaks in a meeting of senior officials from the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae, the government and the ruling Democratic Party held at the National Assembly on April 2, 2019, to discuss ways to cope with the fallout of a 2017 quake in the southeastern city of Pohang.

Doug Ducey said he does not support shutting down the U.S.-Mexico border, as President Donald Trump has said in recent days. (Photo: Tom Tingle/The Republic)\nGov. Doug Ducey said Monday that he does not support closing the U.S.-Mexico border, as President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to do in recent days.\n\"I've said a thousand times or more, Mexico is our No. 1 trading partner, times four,\" Ducey told reporters. \"So, I want to see us continue to be able to trade.\"\nDucey said he believes \"the border does need attention,\" but it's a \"humanitarian crisis, and Congress needs to act.\"\nHe said the White House was aware of his stance.\nTrump on Saturday and again on Monday posted on Twitter that \"Mexico must use its very strong immigration laws to stop the many thousands of people trying to get into the USA\" or else he would shut down the border .\nFollow Arizona politics? Our reporters stay on top of it all. Subscribe to azcentral.com .\nHe'd delivered a similar ultimatum when speaking to reporters on Friday , saying there was \"a very good likelihood that I\u2019ll be closing the border next week\" if Mexico didn\u2019t \"get with it\" in terms of blocking the flow of migrant families at the border.\nHis administration has released families from custody as processing centers struggle to handle the recent uptick.\nApprehensions at the southern border overall had hit historic lows in recent years. Agents caught fewer than 400,000 migrants in 2018, versus the more than 1 million a year detained annually through the 1990s and 2000s.\nThis story includes reporting from USA Today.\nReach the reporter at maria.polletta@arizonarepublic.com or 602-653-6807.

Frankfurt Motor Show. As we\u2019ve seen in the brand\u2019s previous teaser, one of the revisions involves the cars\u2019 taillights, the subject of this video.\nThe first 12 seconds of the clip gives us a detailed look at the cars\u2019 new OLED (organic light-emitting diode) taillights. Made up of 33 individual OLED elements arranged across three rows, each one is individually controllable and you can see how they are lit up in sequence.\nThe thin profile of OLEDs allows the elements to overlap each other and curve around the cluster, which should make for quite a light show. What is peculiar is the inclusion of conventional amber turn signals within the unit, given the OLEDs potential to act as sequential turn signals.\nFancy lights aside, the S-Class Coupe and Cabriolet will also come with revised front and rear bumpers, as well as an updated interior. Following the S-Class Sedan facelift , an improved suite of safety, driver assistance and semi-autonomous driving technologies is likely, plus a new engine line-up.

REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. auto safety regulator said on Monday it will open an investigation into 3 million Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Motors Corp vehicles after reviewing reports of more than 3,000 fires that injured over 100 people. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the investigation is in response to a petition seeking a probe filed in June by the Center for Auto Safety. The investigation covers the 2011-2014 Kia Optima and Sorento and the 2010-2015 Kia Soul, along with the 2011-2014 Hyundai Sonata and Santa Fe. The probe rekindles safety concerns about vehicles of the South Korean duo, who have already been investigated by the U.S. regulator and prosecutors over engine-related recalls. Hyundai and Kia together have recalled over 2.3 million vehicles since 2015 to address various engine fire risks. Hyundai Motor shares fell as much as 2.5 percent in morning trade in Seoul, while Kia Motors fell 1.1 percent. Hyundai said in a statement it was cooperating and added it has been in \"frequent, open and transparent dialogue regarding non-collision engine fires.\" Kia said it will continue to work with NHTSA and \"openly shares information and data with NHTSA on all matters pertaining to vehicle safety.\" NHTSA said the decision to initiate the probe was based on its analysis of information received from multiple manufacturers, consumer complaints and other sources. The agency said while prior Kia and Hyundai vehicle recalls covered by the probe are primarily related to engine fires, the new probe \"is not limited to engine components and may cover additional vehicle systems or components.\" Jason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said it was \"long past time for the full power of the federal government to be brought to bear to answer why so many thousands of Kia and Hyundai vehicles have been involved in non-crash fires.\" He added he hoped the probe will quickly lead to new recalls. \"The evidence is now clear - Hyundai and Kia should have acted to recall these vehicles far earlier,\" he said. Last month, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said a group of U.S. states is investigating Hyundai and Kia for potential unfair and deceptive acts related to reports of hundreds of vehicle fires. In November, Reuters reported federal prosecutors had launched a criminal investigation into Hyundai and Kia to determine if vehicle recalls linked to engine defects had been conducted properly. South Korean prosecutors are also conducting separate investigations into the automakers over the recalls, raiding their offices and summoning executives for questioning. In January, the automakers agreed to offer software upgrades for 3.7 million vehicles not being recalled.

The agency said while prior Kia and Hyundai vehicle recalls covered by the probe are primarily related to engine fires, the new probe \"is not limited to engine components and may cover additional vehicle systems or components.\"\nJason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said it was \"long past time for the full power of the federal government to be brought to bear to answer why so many thousands of Kia and Hyundai vehicles have been involved in non-crash fires.\"\nHe added he hoped the probe will quickly lead to new recalls. \"The evidence is now clear - Hyundai and Kia should have acted to recall these vehicles far earlier,\" he said.\nLast month, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said a group of U.S. states is investigating Hyundai and Kia for potential unfair and deceptive acts related to reports of hundreds of vehicle fires.\nIn November, Reuters reported federal prosecutors had launched a criminal investigation into Hyundai and Kia to determine if vehicle recalls linked to engine defects had been conducted properly.\nSouth Korean prosecutors are also conducting separate investigations into the automakers over the recalls, raiding their offices and summoning executives for questioning.\nIn January, the automakers agreed to offer software upgrades for 3.7 million vehicles not being recalled.\nA South Korean whistleblower in 2016 reported concerns to NHTSA, which has been probing the timeliness of three U.S. recalls and whether they covered enough vehicles.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson in WASHINGTON; Additional reporting by Hyunjoo in SEOUL; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Christopher Cushing)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david shepardson reblog", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "david shepardson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kia", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hyundai", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hyundai motors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for auto safety", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyundai motor co", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhtsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kia motors corp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kia optima", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national highway traffic safety administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyundai sonata", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa fe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T05:57:10.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9f0721081be8c9b3b09d2bebf2363e36736c57b3", "url": "https://paultan.org/2018/05/30/audi-looks-towards-solid-state-batteries-for-electric-supercar-tesla-model-s-rival-under-consideration", "site_full": "paultan.org", "site": "paultan.org", "site_section": "https://paultan.org/topics/cars/audi/page/8/", "site_categories": ["vehicles", "business"], "section_title": "Audi Archives - Page 8 of 97 - Paul Tan's Automotive News", "title": "looks towards solid-state batteries for electric supercar; Tesla Model S rival under consideration", "title_full": "Audi looks towards solid-state batteries for electric supercar; Tesla Model S rival under consideration", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s3.paultan.org/image/2015/03/R8e150006_large-e1450863909392-1200x573.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3936, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9f0721081be8c9b3b09d2bebf2363e36736c57b3", "url": "https://paultan.org/2018/05/30/audi-looks-towards-solid-state-batteries-for-electric-supercar-tesla-model-s-rival-under-consideration", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gerard Lye", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "looks towards solid-state batteries for electric supercar; Tesla Model S rival under consideration", "text": "Audi is looking towards solid-state battery technology as an integral component for a proper lightweight electric sports cars, reports CarAdvice . The German automaker said that while there\u2019s no issue in using current-generation lithium-ion batteries in sports cars, the advantages gained from solid-state batteries (better packaging and higher capacity) can\u2019t be ignored.\nAccording to Audi\u2019s product and technology communications, Peter Oberndorfer, the company already has plans to produce an electric four-door GT-style sports car, rivalling the Tesla Model S . He also hinted that an R8-style electric supercar could be on the way, pending the new battery tech.\n\u201cWe will have very sporty battery electric cars\u2026 the so-called e-tron GT, whether that will be the final name or not, but it will be a four-door car not a successor of the R8,\u201d Oberndorfer said. He added that while the current battery tech meets power requirements, it comes at the expensive of driving dynamics, which is an important requirement for say, an R8 customer.\n\u201cBasically electric cars have very good balance because the batteries are between the axle and very low, maybe with a sports car, it would be different\u2026 The e-tron GT is still three years away or something like that, so you will be surprised what we can do,\u201d Oberndorfer explained.\n\u201cI personally think we need more battery development because sports cars should be light, if you go very fast you need a lot of battery and you don\u2019t want to spend three days going from the Nurburgring to Munich or the other way around. I think for real sports cars you need development of battery and surroundings and then you could think about it,\u201d he continued.\nThe R8 e-tron was Audi\u2019s previous electric sports car but has since been dropped due to poor sales . Reports claim that \u201cless than 100 units\u201d were made, and the hefty one million euro price tag didn\u2019t help either.\nNot too long ago, Audi revealed the e-tron Vision Gran Turismo , an electric racer that exists in both the digital and real world. In the case of the latter, the vehicle featured three electric motors (one at the front, two at the rear) that makes a combined 804 hp and 1,001 Nm of torque. A precursor to a successor for the electric R8?

"title": "SPYSHOTS: W223 Benz S-Class spotted testing again - interior reveals large touchscreen", "text": "Our spy photographers have provided us with more photos of the upcoming W223 Mercedes-Benz S-Class, which includes an early look at its revamped cabin. There\u2019re also a few shots of the sedan\u2019s exterior too, revealing a little bit more than what we saw in previous spyshots .\nFocusing on the main topic at hand, the new S-Class appears to have ditched the W222\u2019s Widescreen Cockpit, with the digital instrument cluster and main infotainment display now independent from one another. The former has a rather familiar look and should come with a myriad of customisation options like different screens and displayed information.\nHowever, the latter is completely new as it is a tablet-style touchscreen that takes up quite a bit of real estate. The apparent goal here is possibly to minimise button clutter, as a few of the car\u2019s controls \u2013 Dynamic Select, parking assistance system, HVAC and media \u2013 are now parked at the base of the large screen. The Mercedes-Benz User Experience (MBUX) user interface will likely be deployed here as well.\nElsewhere, we see a steering wheel design that is similar to the current W222 , although the Touch Control looks to be different. The steering column-mounted gear selector is retained here, and the stalk has been made to appear more upmarket than before.\nFrom the outside, the reduced amount of camouflage allows us to spot the S-Class\u2019 production lights, including what appears to be tri-band Multibeam LED units at the front, and taillights that are wider. Meanwhile, the front fascia is as we\u2019ve seen on previous mules , with strong influences from the latest CLS and A-Class .\nThe new S-Class will be built at the company\u2019s Factory 56 facility , and should come with a range of six- and eight-cylinder engines. Hybrid variants should be included in the mix too, along with an all-electric version reportedly called the EQS. Reports indicate the standard S-Class models will ride on the MRA platform, while the EV gets the Modular Electric Architecture (MEA) instead.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "benz", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mercedes-benz", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T06:06:46.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b306811571dbd9ab4774cd57ff0ed936a3a0b358", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/kse-says-theres-no-coalition-between-cong-and-jds/articleshow/68660868.cms", "site_full": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubli", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Hubballi News, Latest Hubballi News Headlines &amp; Live Updates - Times of India", "title": "KSE says there\u2019s no coalition between Cong and JD(S) | Hubballi News", "title_full": "KSE says there\u2019s no coalition between Cong and JD(S) | Hubballi News - Times of India", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b306811571dbd9ab4774cd57ff0ed936a3a0b358", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/kse-says-theres-no-coalition-between-cong-and-jds/articleshow/68660868.cms", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "indiatimes.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "KSE says there\u2019s no coalition between Cong and JD(S) | Hubballi News", "text": "Hubballi: BJP leader K S Eshwarappa took a dig at coalition partners Congress and JD(S), saying minister G T Devegowda keeps himself away from Congress campaign rallies in Mysuru Lok Sabha constituency, and the photos of former chief minister Siddaramaiah were absent in the hoardings of Congress-JD(S) Parivarnata Samavesh held in Bengaluru on Sunday.\nSpeaking to reporters here on Sunday, Eshwarappa attacked the Congress-JD(S) coalition government, saying they claiming their alliance is only for public consumption. \u201cBut in reality, there is no coalition between them. If coalition was strong, they would have announced their candidates for all Lok Sabha constituencies in the state. Despite being allies, they are still struggling to finalise tickets at many constituencies. Siddaramaiah himself has admitted that there still is confusion, and they are resolving it.

He announced that all fentanyl-related drugs will become controlled substances, effective May 1. Sam McNeil / AP\nChina has announced that all variants of fentanyl will be treated as controlled substances, after Washington urged Beijing to stop fueling the opioid epidemic in the United States.\nAuthorities in China already regulate 25 variants of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid linked to thousands of drug overdose deaths in the U.S. But some manufacturers in China, seeking to evade controls, have introduced slight changes to the molecular structure of their drugs, giving them the legal loophole to manufacture and export before the government can assess the products for safety and medical use.\nThe decision to regulate all fentanyl-related drugs as controlled substances \"puts a wider array of substances under regulation,\" Liu Yuejin, an official of China's National Narcotics Control Commission, said at a press conference in on Monday. The regulation will take effect May 1.\nBryce Pardo, a drug policy researcher at Rand Corporation, tells NPR that in theory, the regulation \"future-proofs the law\" by including impending chemical modifications.\nBut China may not be able to enforce the new rules, Pardo says. \"[Authorities] already have problems enforcing existing laws.\" He says official reports show the country does not have enough inspectors for facilities, and law enforcement would have to \"take a sample\" from a facility and eventually \"analyze whether it's a fentanyl-related structure.\"\nVanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution who focuses on illegal economies, tells NPR the regulation is \"a good step,\" but whether China \"will have the will and the capacity to do it is a big question.\"\nThe United States and China have been negotiating for better drug control since the Obama era, she adds. In the midst of the trade war with the Trump administration, \"China is looking for one area where it can still continue cooperating with the U.S.,\" Felbab-Brown says.\nThe announcement comes after President Xi Jinping vowed in a December meeting with President Trump to classify fentanyl as a controlled substance . After the meeting, Trump called on China to seek the death penalty for fentanyl distributors.\nLiu denied on Monday accusations that China is a major contributor to the U.S. opioid crisis, saying Chinese law enforcement has \"solved several cases\" of illegal fentanyl-related drug manufacturing and distribution. \"They are all shipped to the U.S. by criminals through evasive means, through international packages,\" Liu said. \"The amount is extremely limited and cannot be the main source of the substance in the U.S.\"\nHe said the U.S. opioid problem was mainly caused by \"domestic reasons,\" according to the South China Morning Post .\nAccording to a 2018 report by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission , China remains \"the largest source of illicit fentanyl and fentanyl-like substances\" in the United States and \"illicit manufacturers create new substances faster than they can be controlled.\"\nChemical exporters in China secretly send drugs to the West through fake shipment labels and other tactics, the report stated.\nFentanyl is a synthetic opioid that relieves extreme pain. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It also is the drug most often found in overdose deaths in the United States. In 2016, fentanyl was linked to more than 18,000 drug overdose deaths, 29 percent of drug overdose deaths that year, according to a National Vital Statistics System report.\nFelbab-Brown says China's new stance on fentanyl-related substances stems partially from a desire to be a global enforcer on drugs. \"From a public relations perspective, it's difficult for China to be accused of being a source of drugs,\" she says.\nChina does not have a monopoly on fentanyl production, she adds. \"Even if tomorrow the United States wouldn't get fentanyl from China, others would step in. Most obviously India , a major source of addictive drugs.\"\nJingnan Huo contributed to this report. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.

But not just any sneakers: limited edition, vintage collectors items, like Air Jordan, Nike Air Max, Adidas Yeezy Boost, Revenge X Storm, Fear of God Military, and more. \"It may sound crazy, but we see ourselves as kind of cultural ambassadors creating bridges between the U.S. and China,\" Jiahuan Xia, a partner and co-founder of SoleStage, a leading limited edition sneaker reseller, told Xinhua Sunday. \"Nothing communicates better across cultures than a shared passion.\" \"When you collect cool kicks, it doesn't matter if you are American or Chinese or from anywhere else in the world,\" added one of his co-founding partners, Yu Zhang. An expert at intuiting the links between fashion and one's sense of identity, Xia explained, \"We all love basketball and rap music, so sneakers become a common language for young guys like us. If I see their sneakers, I can tell just by looking at them what they like and what kind of a person they are.\" Led by rappers, pro-ballers and young Hollywood celebrities whose fame gives them that coveted \"cool factor,\" limited edition sneakers have come of age and are all the rage in both China and the United States. That popularity has spawned a massive athletic shoe industry that topped 60 billion U.S. dollars worldwide in 2018 and is expected to rise to 95 billion U.S. dollars by 2025, according to 29-year-old Zhang. Limited quantities of any popular commodity naturally spawn fierce competition amongst buyers eager to possess it. According to Forbes, that has fueled a billion dollar secondary resale market in which a rare model bought for a mere 190 U.S. dollars can rocket up in price overnight to 6,000 U.S. dollars a pair. A Chinese-owned U.S. consignment store chain, SoleStage is riding that wave. SoleStage was founded in 2013 by Lei Wang, Zhang, and the youngest, Xia, three young Chinese guys who shared a passion for athletic shoes. At the tender ages of 13 to 15, they all started out, separately, as collectors, but got fired up with entrepreneurial zeal when they realized how profitable resale opportunities were. \"We decided to go into business together when we realized that separately we were just driving up prices for each other, but if we worked together, we could combine our expertise and connections and get great products at better prices,\" Zhang explained. \"It was hard in the beginning because some buyers were afraid that because we were Chinese we might be selling fakes. So we had to work extra hard to build our reputation for honesty and access to rare, authentic products,\" revealed Zhang. And that hard work paid off. To date, the trio have opened three stores in California - Los Angeles, Irvine and Santa Clara - and one in New York City, that cater to American consumers - mostly young, hip males - serviced from a massive warehouse in City of Industry, a suburban city located 20 kilometers east of Los Angeles downtown, cock full of product that ensures they can keep up with the increasing demand. And, they are opening a fifth store in Beijing in May to better serve the Chinese market. \"What sets this store apart is it has something for all its customers, not just one hyped clothing brand,\" Angel Cornejo, the Hispanic-American manager of the Los Angeles store, told Xinhua. \"We reach a bigger audience. And we've got great connections, so we can offer rare stuff.\" \"That's the whole point,\" Xia agreed. \"With our connections, we can bring authentic U.S fashion and sneakers to China and bring Chinese brands to the U.S. It's gotta go both ways.\" Xia wear a sport vest with a striking logo of Li Ning, a Chinese sportswear brand who debuted its fall/winter 2019 collection at the New York Fashion Week (NYFW) last month. Xia said SoleStage joined the promotion works. By 2018, these three young guys had built a successful resale business, and they expect substantial growth next year when they release their new shoe buying app, \"Shine,\" that will provide accurate, up-to-the-second price comparisons and sales opportunities in both the United States and China. \"We know both ends, both countries, that's our advantage. We are an American-based brand that understands the U.S. market, but we are also Chinese, and we know China better than any of our competitors ever could,\" asserted Xia. And their customers agree. \"Fashion should be about expressing yourself and being unique. And these guys have that,\" said one young American shopper at SoleStage's Los Angeles store, next to Supreme, in the trendy West Hollywood Fairfax district. Supreme is an American skateboarding shop and clothing brand, established in New York City in April of 1994. The brand, catering to the hip hop, rock cultures, and the youth culture in general, is very popular both in the United States and China. Popular R&B and hip hop artist, Joseph DeVinci from Atlanta, told Xinhua, \"I've been here, like, 50 times. I find the craziest thing and buy it. I bought [Kobe] Bricks yesterday. I bought two pair of Yeezy's last week. I'm not a collector, I just like shoes.\" Store manager Angel seconded that. \"We all love shoes.

One researcher says yes", "text": "The unusually mild weather that melted Yellowknife's snow castle and closed winter roads this March should not be seen as just an isolated case of weird weather, says a researcher who has studied the North for decades. Above-zero temperatures broke numerous weather records across the territory in mid-March, closed the Mackenzie Valley winter road due to deteriorating conditions, and forced two Yellowknife festivals that are usually held on the frozen Great Slave Lake to change their plans.\nBill Quinton, a hydrologist and director of the Cold Regions Research Centre at Wilfred Laurier University in Waterloo, Ont., said this mild spell should not be seen as just an anomaly.\n\"You can have this type of thing in both a weather anomaly or climate change, but considering the context of all other things that are going on \u2014 considering, you know, what the mass of evidence that's indicating a warming climate \u2014 this is not inconsistent with that,\" he said in an interview Friday.\nThe centre has a base in Yellowknife, and Quinton has been working in the North since the late 1980s.\nSubmitted by Brandon Orlias More Should we be cautious about blaming everything on climate change?\nQuinton said there is a risk associated with saying every unusual or unprecedented weather event is a sign of climate change. However, he said we should not rule out climate change as a factor.\n\"There are things that have happened in the past that in terms of the weather and climate that might not be a result of a warming trend, but what we've seen is consistent with warming,\" he said.\n\"So we have to be a bit careful with blaming everything on on climate change, but we also have to be aware as well that this warming does involve greater variability, and this is part of that.\"\nCBC More What does this unusual weather look like to someone who studies climate?\nQuinton said what he sees in the recent mild spell is how it's reinforcing what northerners have told him about the impacts of the changing climate on their communities.\n\"There's some concerns with food security [because] as the land's changing, it can produce different different types of vegetation and so on,\" he said.\n\"There's concerns about wildfires, their increasing frequency and magnitude. There's concerns about infrastructure in the towns and communities, and I guess this latest event is part of that \u2014 it's closing down ice roads, ice bridges, and there's economic impacts on communities.\"\nStory continues He said air temperatures in the Dehcho region, where he has worked in recent months, have been warming \"pretty much consistently since the 1970s\" and people are seeing other impacts of that trend.\n\"When you have ground thaw, you often have a change on the surface in terms of the type of vegetation that support it. So we're seeing some expansion of wetlands and the forests shrinking as a result,\" he said.\n\"What we're seeing this month is a result of of a warming climate. It shouldn't really surprise us that we're seeing this and this is, you know, we're going to see this again going forward over the coming years.\"\nWhat's the ultimate takeaway here?\nQuinton said his takeaway from this is not to treat unusual weather as one-off events.\n\"Let's not look at this these things as isolated. It's part of a consistent story,\" he said.\n\"The question for us is how do we adapt and how do we mitigate where possible, and how do we become better predictors of the impacts of these warming effects, and so that we can all get on the same page and move forward forward with a minimum of impact on our communities and economy and environment.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zAEvZv2bP9at1dYjAQCwmQ--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-CA/homerun/cbc.ca/54c30c625d2c23bdcde2660639ab6fbb", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YyUBHuk9WhUrN92dv2MecA--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-CA/homerun/cbc.ca/c3d7f6f59487f101f014f013a524ca46);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YyUBHuk9WhUrN92dv2MecA--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-CA/homerun/cbc.ca/c3d7f6f59487f101f014f013a524ca46", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zAEvZv2bP9at1dYjAQCwmQ--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-CA/homerun/cbc.ca/54c30c625d2c23bdcde2660639ab6fbb);"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "quinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill quinton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "n.w.t.", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "wilfred laurier university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cold regions research centre", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "yellowknife", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waterloo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ont.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mackenzie valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "great slave lake", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T06:27:55.070+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "342bac3aa98dd0fcc44a5818539dc2e09d3b21a8", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2758167409", "site_full": "www.goodreads.com", "site": "goodreads.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["books_and_literature", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "Vanessa Shantel (Belize City, 01, Belize)\u2019s review of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire", "title_full": "Vanessa Shantel (Belize City, 01, Belize)\u2019s review of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 300, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "342bac3aa98dd0fcc44a5818539dc2e09d3b21a8", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2758167409", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "J.K.

But on Saturday the U.S. State Department said it was cutting off aid to those three countries.\nDetentions at the U.S. border have surged in recent months, angering Trump and putting pressure on Lopez Obrador to find a solution that will prevent a shutdown of the frontier to the market for 80 percent of Mexico\u2019s exports.\nAsked if it was time to put pressure on the Central American countries to do more to tackle the problem, Lopez Obrador said the causes of migration were \u201cnot being attended to\u201d and that people needed to be offered more opportunities there.\n\u201cObviously, we have to help because Central American migrants pass through our territory and we have to bring order to this migration, make sure it\u2019s legal,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.

Share: Apr 02, 2019, 09:04 AM IST Source: PTI Trending News Aamrapali Dubey's latest hilarious TikTok video is unmissable\u2014Watch\nWashington: The NASA on Monday termed as a \"terrible thing\" India's shooting down of one of its satellites that has created about 400 pieces of orbital debris, endangering the International Space Station (ISS).\nNASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said about 60 pieces have been tracked so far and out of which 24 are going above the apogee of the ISS.\n\"That is a terrible, terrible thing to create an event that sends debris and an apogee that goes above the international space station. That kind of activity is not compatible with the future of human spaceflight that we need to see have happened,\" he said at a NASA townhall here.\n\"The ASAT test by India last week has resulted in about 400 pieces of orbital debris,\" he added.\n(Also read: US 'takes note' of India's Mission Shakti )\nBridenstine said not all of the pieces were big enough to track and the NASA is right now tracking objects which are 10 centimeters or bigger.\n\"Some 60 pieces of orbital debris have been tracked so far, 24 out of which poses risk to the International Space Station,\" he said.\nBridenstine was addressing employees of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a televised address, announced that India shot down a satellite in space with a missile, catapulting the country into an elite club of space powers alongside the US, Russia and China\nBridenstine is the first top official from the Trump administration to come out in public against the India's ASAT test.\n\"We are charged with commercialising of low earth orbit. We are charged with enabling more activities in space than we've ever seen before for the purpose of benefiting the human condition, whether it's pharmaceuticals or printing human organs in 3D to save lives here on earth or manufacturing capabilities in space that you're not able to do in a gravity well,\" he said.\n\"All of those are placed at risk when these kinds of events happen,\" Bridenstine said as he feared India's ASAT test could risk proliferation of such activities by other countries.\n\"When one country does it, other countries feel like they have to do it as well,\" he said.\n\"It's unacceptable. The NASA needs to be very clear about what its impact to us is,\" the NASA Administrator said. He said the NASA is \"learning more and more every hour\" that goes by about this orbital debris field that has been created from the anti- satellite test.\n\"Where we were last week with an assessment that comes from NASA experts as well as the Joint Space Operations Center (part of US Strategic Command).. Is that the risk to the International Space Station has increased by 44 per cent,\" Bridenstine said.\nThe risk from small debris as a result of the ASAT test to the ISS went up 44 per cent over a period of 10 days. \"So, the good thing is it's low enough in earth orbit that over time this will all dissipate,\" he told his NASA colleagues.\nHe said a lot of debris from the 2007 direct ascent anti-satellite test by China is still in the space.\n\"And we're still dealing with it. We are still, we as a nation are responsible for doing space situational awareness and space traffic management, conjunction analysis for the entire world,\" Bridenstine said.\nThe US, he said, is doing it for free with the its taxpayers money from an orbital debris field that was created by another country.\n\"Why do we do that as a nation? Because it's the right thing to do because we want to preserve the space environment,\" he said.\nAccording to Bridenstine, the US is currently tracking about 23,000 pieces of orbital debris that are 10 centimeters or bigger.\n\"At the end of the day we need to be clear with everybody in the world, we're the only agency in the federal government that has human lives at stake here. And it is not acceptable for us to allow people to create orbital debris fields that put at risk our people,\" he said.\nBridenstine said while the risk of the ISS went up 44 per cent, the astronauts are still safe.\n\"The International Space Station is still safe. If we need to manoeuvre it, we will. The probability of that I think is low. But at the end of the day we have to be clear also that these activities are not sustainable or compatible with human spaceflight,\" he said.

second system glitch in a week", "text": "(Reuters) - Major U.S. airlines were back up and running on Monday after a system-wide outage delayed hundreds of flights and fired-up customer complaints on social media, the second such disruption in a week. The Federal Aviation Administration said the root of the problem was caused by the program provided by Scottsdale, Arizona-based AeroData Inc that helps airlines measure and manage weight and balance.\nThe agency released a statement around 8.30 a.m. ET, saying the issue had been resolved and an FAA spokesman said it plans to look into the outage.\nAmerican Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines had reported outages. United Airlines said it was unable to create paperwork for some time.\n\"A brief third-party technology issue that prevented some Delta Connection flights from being dispatched on time this morning has been resolved,\" Delta said.\nOther airlines also reported a series of delays.\nSouthwest Airlines was the first carrier to report that the problem had been resolved and it would get travelers moving soon, but added that customers could expect flight delays.\nA Southwest spokesman could not confirm how many flights were delayed, but said it was safe to say hundreds.\nFlightAware, an airline tracking website, said Southwest had delayed 775 flights, or 18 percent of its U.S. flights on Monday.\nAmerican Airlines, JetBlue Airways Corp, United Airlines and other carriers later said the technical issue had been resolved. JetBlue added it was still dealing with residual delays, while United said about 150 flights were delayed.\nLast week, several airlines had reported issues with Sabre Corp's flight reservation and booking system due to which passengers had difficulty accessing flight check-in systems.\nAERODATA GLITCH, PASSENGER STORM\nJust a few minutes of system downtime in AeroData can result in over 100 delayed flights and loss of revenue, according to a 2017 case study by VMware Inc.\nAeroData could not be immediately reached for comment.\nCustomers barraged Twitter with their complaints over confusion at airports and delayed flights.\nOne Southwest passenger reported waiting on the tarmac in a plane in Dallas for 90 minutes after his 6 a.m. flight to New Orleans was delayed. The airline said after the systems resumed that the flight would arrive at 8.05 a.m.\n\"@SouthwestAir, I get the glitch, but if you could update your flight status times to current status that would help confused travelers from running frantic to catch a flight when the plane is not even waiting at the gate yet. Flight 929 not 8:50 but 'around' 10 am,\" a passenger tweeted. https://bit.ly/2I4UPfV\n\"My number one traveling pet peeve? Not updating a flight as delayed when you know the prior flight is delayed.

The committee said on Monday that they may have documents related to the Mueller probe.\nDemocrats have become increasingly frustrated over U.S. Attorney General William Barr's plan to share only a redacted copy of the nearly 400-page investigative report with Congress. The committee will vote on a resolution to allow House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler to issue subpoenas at his own discretion.\nThe Mueller report describes his office's 22-month probe, which did not establish that members of Trump's campaign conspired with Russia but also did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice, according to a four-page summary Barr released on March 24.\nBarr said Mueller's team had not found enough proof to warrant bringing obstruction charges against the president.\nTrump and the White House have hailed the conclusions as a victory for the president. But Democrats have taken issue with Barr's intervention.\n\"Congress, not the attorney general, has a duty under the Constitution to determine whether wrongdoing has occurred,\" Nadler wrote in a New York Times Op-Ed on Monday.\n\"It is not the attorney general's job to step in and substitute his judgment for the special counsel's. That responsibility falls to Congress - and specifically to the House Judiciary Committee - as it has in every similar investigation in modern history.\"\nA week ago, Nadler and the Democratic heads of five other House committees gave Barr until Tuesday to provide the full Mueller report and underlying evidence. Barr said he would issue his redacted version by mid-April or sooner.\nTrump on Monday took aim at Democrats in the aftermath of the Mueller probe.\n\"No matter what information is given to the crazed Democrats from the No Collusion Mueller Report, it will never be good enough. Behind closed doors the Dems are laughing!\" the president said on Twitter.\nRepublicans on the judiciary panel say Congress does not need the unredacted Mueller report to do its job and accuse Democrats of setting arbitrary deadlines as part of a partisan campaign to undermine Trump ahead of the 2020 election.\n\"The attorney general has already demonstrated transparency above and beyond what is required,\" Representative Doug Collins, the top Republican on the judiciary committee, said in a statement.\nBut Democrats say Republicans helped set a precedent for Congress to obtain underlying investigative material during their investigation into Democrat Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.\nThe committee said the Justice Department gave Congress more than 880,000 pages of internal investigative records from the Clinton probe as well as classified and sensitive law enforcement information from an early Russia probe that Mueller took over.\nIn addition to McGahn and Bannon, the committee will consider subpoenas for former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks, former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and former White House deputy counsel Ann Donaldson.\nThe five former Trump aides were among 81 individuals, agencies and other entities that received document requests on March 4 as part of the committee's obstruction and corruption investigation of Trump and his associates.\n(Reporting by David Morgan and David Alexander in Washington; Additional reporting by Karen Freifeld in New York; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and James Dalgleish)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david morgan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald mcgahn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerrold nadler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "william barr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "house judiciary committee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "u.s. house judiciary committee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T07:16:18.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "538946ce46cec7f630770c08766335e894f87cf4", "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-sg/news/politics/trump-white-house-presses-threat-to-close-us-mexico-border-this-week/ar-BBVvCFa", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "https://www.msn.com/en-sg/news", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "Top news stories from Singapore and around the world \u2013 MSN Singapore News", "title": "Trump White House presses threat to close U.S.-Mexico border this week", "title_full": "Trump White House presses threat to close U.S.-Mexico border this week", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.514, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "538946ce46cec7f630770c08766335e894f87cf4", "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-sg/news/politics/trump-white-house-presses-threat-to-close-us-mexico-border-this-week/ar-BBVvCFa", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "David Lynch, Maria Sacchetti, Joel Achenbach", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Trump White House presses threat to close U.S.-Mexico border this week", "text": "Trump White House presses threat to close U.S.-Mexico border this week The Washington Post 1 day ago David Lynch, Maria Sacchetti, Joel Achenbach Replay Video UP NEXT Pope in Morocco says physical barriers won't solve migration issue Video footage shows an unidentified man charging a car carrying the Moroccan king during a parade with Pope Francis.

Then .\u2009.\u2009. we would see layoffs within a day or two,\u201d said Lance Jungmeyer, president of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas in Nogales, Ariz. \u201cThis is not going to help border security.\u201d\nTwo of the president\u2019s most senior aides nonetheless defended the move on the Sunday news shows. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said on ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that it would take \u201csomething dramatic\u201d to persuade the president to abandon his border-closing plans. And Counselor to the President Kellyane Conway insisted on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that the president\u2019s threat \u201ccertainly isn\u2019t a bluff.\u201d\nTrump sparked the latest immigration-related controversy Friday when he complained to reporters about Mexico\u2019s failure to stem the migrant influx, a point he underscored in a tweet the next day. \u201cIf they don\u2019t stop them, we are closing the border. We\u2019ll close it. And we\u2019ll keep it closed for a long time. I\u2019m not playing games,\u201d Trump said Friday.\nAdministration officials have offered no details about the president\u2019s intentions, and border control officials have received no instructions to prepare for a shutdown, according to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the issue. Implementing such an order would require time to notify Congress and labor unions representing Border Patrol agents and customs officers, the official said.\nA Pentagon spokesman said the military, which has about 5,300 troops in the border region, has not received such orders either.\nMexican officials have tried to avoid inflaming the situation, offering no public comment since Friday, when President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said: \u201cWe are going to help, to collaborate. We want to have a good relationship with the government of the United States.

Bush and is now a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.\nThe U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the signature achievement thus far of the president\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d trade offensive, faces an uphill battle in Congress.\nThe U.S.-Mexico border is a key artery in the global economy, with more than $611 billion in cross-border trade last year, according to the Commerce Department. Each day, more than 1,000 trucks cross the border at the port of Calexico East, Calif., while more than 11 daily international trains go through Laredo, Tex., according to the U.S. Transportation Department.\nIn Laredo, business leaders and elected officials held frantic conference calls over the weekend about the threatened closure. Gerry Schwebel, executive vice president of the international division of Laredo-based IBC Bank, said U.S.-Mexico traffic has occasionally been restricted, but only temporarily and only in the event of emergencies, such as floods, tornadoes or security checks after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\nEven a border slowdown could create shortages of goods and services and lead to higher prices for consumers, he said, adding: \u201cIf you want to create an economic crisis, then shutting down the border will create an economic crisis.\u201d\nThe economic consequences of a complete shutdown would be immediate and severe, trade specialists said, with automakers and American farmers among the first to feel the pain.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unworkable and unrealistic, and I don\u2019t think he could really do it,\u201d said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents multinational corporations. \u201cThere would certainly be legal challenges from lots and lots of companies.\u201d\nIn his TV appearances, Mulvaney also reiterated the administration\u2019s intention to end hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance to the \u201cNorthern Triangle\u201d countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, including programs designed to curb the gang violence that has caused many people to flee north.\nReplay Video UP NEXT Democrats slam 'cruel' Trump action on healthcare Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation on April 2 to fight the Justice Department's push to repeal the Affordable Care Act through the courts.

On Friday, the Border Patrol\u2019s Tucson field office issued a notice that it would immediately end Sunday processing of commercial trucks at the Port of Nogales, Ariz.\nTo deal with \u201can unprecedented humanitarian and border security crisis all along our Southwest border,\u201d the agency said it had redeployed 750 border agents from ports of entry to areas affected by the migrant flood.\nJungmeyer, the produce industry representative, said the reduction to six days of operation each week will have a significant effect on the fresh produce industry, which operates on a \u201cjust-in-time\u201d schedule of deliveries.\nAt this time of year, trucks travel to Mexico to collect watermelons and table grapes. Once full, they head for the United States, where they drop their cargo at American warehouses before quickly returning to Mexico for another load.\n\u00a9 Sergio Flores/For The Washington Post U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Agents check passports and identification of those crossing into the U.S. at the border between Ciudad Juarez and El Paso, Texas on Friday. March 29, 2019. Eliminating one workday at a port that handled 337,179 trucks last year would disrupt that carefully-calibrated schedule.\n\u201cIt messes up harvests. It messes up your ability to service customers on the U.S. side of the border,\u201d Jungmeyer said.\nSuddenly halting the passage of people and goods between the United States and Mexico also would interrupt the flow of parts headed to American factories, which could bring some production to a halt. Likewise, refrigerated trucks full of perishable commodities such as beef would jam border crossings.\n\u201cThe first question would be: Where do you put it?\u201d said William Reinsch , who served in the Commerce Department under President Bill Clinton. \u201cStuff is going to stack up at the border because it\u2019s already on the way there.\u201d\nArturo Sarukhan, Mexico\u2019s ambassador to the United States from 2007 to 2013, said farm states, many of which backed Trump in 2016, would be among the casualties. Closing the border would be a \u201cself-inflicted wound,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to try to second guess whether the president is playing chicken, bluffing or spewing whatever comes to his mind,\u201d Sarukhan said Sunday. \u201cThe reality is that it would be extremely costly for the United States in terms of trade and economic well being.\u201d\nStephen Legomsky, professor emeritus at the Washington University School of Law and former chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said closing the ports would likely end up in court because it would violate federal immigration laws.\nTrump \u201ccannot close every port on the border,\u201d Legomsky said. \u201cIf he did so, he would effectively undermine the entire congressional scheme for who may enter the U.S. and who may not.\u201d\nClosing the border is also unlikely to stanch the influx of asylum seekers, he said, because federal law authorizes them to request protection once they step on U.S. soil. \u201cIf anything, closing the authorized points would just drive more traffic between the ports of entry where people can enter illegally,\u201d he said.\nAdministration officials insist that inaction is not an option. About 100,000 migrants are believed to have arrived at the border this month, Mulvaney said, a human tide that has overwhelmed U.S. authorities and sparked profound partisan disagreement over potential remedies.\nOn Saturday, Trump tweeted: \u201cOur detention areas are maxed out & we will take no more illegals. Next step is to close the Border!\u201d\njoel.achenbach@washpost.com\ndavid.lynch@washpost.com\nmaria.sacchetti@washpost.com\nMary Beth Sheridan and Kevin Sieff in Mexico City and Nick Miroff and

Arshad Mohammed, Patricia Zengerle and Richard Cowan \u00a9 Reuters/Shannon Stapleton FILE PHOTO: Central American asylum seekers are escorted out of the Chaparral border crossing gate after being sent back to Mexico by the U.S. in Tijuana, Mexico By Arshad Mohammed, Patricia Zengerle and Richard Cowan\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - People inside and outside the Trump administration scrambled on Monday to figure out what aid it plans to cut from three Central American nations and how that is a good idea given that much of the money aims to curb migration.\nThe State Department said on Saturday it would carry out President Donald Trump's repeated threats to end U.S. foreign assistance programs with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.\nWithout providing evidence, Trump said on Friday the countries had \"set up\" caravans of migrants in order to export them to the United States. A surge of asylum seekers from the three countries, known collectively as the Northern Triangle, has sought to enter the United States in recent days.\nCongressional aides and U.S. officials said they were trying to establish what money would be eliminated, and even some of Trump's fellow Republicans questioned the wisdom of curbing the aid, much of which aims to reduce violence, gang activity and the illicit drug trade - all factors that send migrants north.\n\"If we cut all this funding, and a lot of it, quite honestly, is seriously law enforcement that we're doing down there ... I think it's going to make things tragically worse, not better,\" said Representative Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee.\nThe State Department did not elaborate beyond its weekend statement that it was \"carrying out the President's direction and ending FY 2017 and FY 2018 foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle\" and would engage Congress. The U.S. fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30.\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, one congressional aide said it was his understanding the administration planned to reprogram \u2013 or dedicate to other purposes \u2013 about $450 million in fiscal-year 2018 funds.\nIn addition, according to the aide, the department planned to review fiscal-year 2017 and 2018 funds that have been obligated, but not spent, and redirect those to other purposes.\nThe aide and others said, however, that Congress had yet to receive any formal notices from the State Department about exactly which funds are involved, what they were originally for or where the department wants to reprogram them.\nAsked if the department knew what programs would be cut, a second congressional aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said: \"If they do, they haven't told us yet. My sense is they are trying to figure that out.\"\n'TOTALLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE'\nA former U.S. official in contact with those still in the government said emails were flying around the State Department among officials trying to figure out what was going on.\n\"Nobody knows what this is,\" he said, adding that by midday on Monday, no instructions had been sent to U.S. aid missions in the region on how to implement the decision.\nThe situation was reminiscent of a 2018 New Year's Day tweet in which Trump appeared to decree an end to U.S. aid for Pakistan, sending officials scrambling to suspend security aid without even knowing how much they were freezing.\nCritics argued the administration's planned Central America aid cutoff would be tantamount to cutting off its nose to spite its face.\n\"It's totally counterproductive,\" said Rebecca Bill Chavez, who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for Western Hemisphere Affairs during former President Barack Obama's administration and who is now at the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington.\n\"If the intent is to slow migration, this is going to have the opposite effect,\" she added.\nSpeaking on ABC News' \"This Week\" program on Sunday, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said the United States needed more help from the \"Northern Triangle\" countries and Mexico, where the migrants typically enter the United States.\n\"You can make all the promises you want but when you're still sending 100,000 people across the southern border, actions speak louder than words,\" Mulvaney said. \"We want to work with the Northern Triangle countries but we need their assistance.\"\nDemocrats were scathing about the planned cuts.\n\"Most of this aid is intended to address the causes of migration - reduce poverty, violence, gangs, improve rule of law, and reform justice systems,\" said Senator Patrick Leahy, the senior Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"It is shooting ourselves in the foot to cut off the assistance.\"\n(Reporting by Arshad Mohammed, Patricia Zengerle and Richard Cowan;
