The halt in the delivery of parts and manuals is the first step toward ending the actual aircraft sale.\nA top US general said last month he would recommend that the United States withhold delivery of F-35 fighter jets to Turkey if Ankara goes through with the purchase of the Russian S-400 air defense system.\nMonday\u0092s move comes just days after Turkey's foreign minister said his country was committed to a deal to buy the Russian system and was discussing delivery dates.\nIn January, Turkey rejected a US offer to cancel its purchase of S-400 missiles from Russia.

The three leading candidates took tough lines on relations with Russia, with which Ukraine has been at war since the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russian forces. But Sunday\u2019s voting dealt a blow to Moscow\u2019s main nemesis, President Petro Poroshenko, who ran a weak second to enter the April 21 runoff.\n\u201cThe Kremlin didn\u2019t believe Zelenskiy could win until March as they just don\u2019t understand these things,\u201d said Gleb Pavlovsky, a Moscow political analyst who has advised Russian officials on Ukrainian politics, referring to the success of the comedian\u2019s insurgent campaign. \u201cNow they will be preparing for the parliamentary elections\u201d in the fall, he said.\nMoscow has struggled to rebuild influence in Ukraine, its biggest former-Soviet neighbor and a key transit route for gas exports, after the 2014 crisis in which pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted. In addition to annexing Crimea, Russian-backed forces fueled a rebellion in eastern Ukraine that\u2019s killed more than 13,000 and continues to fester.\nRead More: TV Comic Favorite to Supplant Ukrainian President in Vote Runoff\nKremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was \u201cpremature\u201d to comment on the results before the second round is complete, adding, \u201cOf course, we\u2019d like to see not the party of war at the helm in Ukraine but a party that is aiming at gradual normalization of the situation in southeastern Ukraine.\u201d\nZelenskiy tapped into anger at Ukraine\u2019s lack of progress from the pro-European revolution that ousted Yanukovych. With nearly three-quarters of the vote counted, he had 30 percent, with Poroshenko getting 16 percent and former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko at 13 percent.\nPoroshenko pledged to push Ukraine faster toward membership in the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and painted Zelenskiy as a \u201cpuppet\u201d of the wealthy oligarch whose television channel carries his show. Poroshenko has also tried to undermine support for Zelenskiy by casting him as the Kremlin\u2019s preferred candidate.\nParliamentary Contest\nZelenskiy has released few details of his policy program and repeatedly denied political links to the billionaire, Igor Kolomoisky, who backed volunteer military units that fought the pro-Russian separatists and drew Vladimir Putin\u2019s ire in 2014 for calling the Russian president \u201ca schizophrenic of short stature.\u201d\n\u201cFor the Kremlin, Zelenskiy is probably more favorable than Poroshenko, but only because he has no political experience,\u201d said Alexei Makarkin, vice president of the Center for Political Technologies in Moscow.\nRussian state television highlighted allegations of voting irregularities in its coverage, with the main Sunday-evening news show saying, \u201cpeople don\u2019t have much hope of improvement after the elections.\u201d\nIf Zelenskiy prevails in the runoff -- as polls currently show he\u2019s likely to -- that could provide an opportunity for the Kremlin to foment further instability in the transition period, Pavlovsky said. In a power vacuum, \u201cPutin could make a play and meddle, combining military, economic and political actions,\u201d he said.\nSunday\u2019s results brought some good news for Moscow in the strong showing of a pro-Russian candidate, Yuri Boiko, who was running fourth with 12 percent of the vote. That could position him well for the parliamentary elections, according to analysts in Moscow.\n\u201cThe Kremlin has it\u2019s own game and it\u2019s shown it clearly: it wants a larger loyal faction in the Rada,\u201d said Makarkin of the Center for Political Technologies, referring to the parliament.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Stepan Kravchenko in Moscow at skravchenko@bloomberg.net;Ilya Arkhipov in Moscow at iarkhipov@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Gregory L.

The aircraft is built by Lockheed Martin Corp.\nA Pentagon official had told Reuters in March that the United States had a number of items it could withhold in order to send Turkey a signal that the United States was serious about Ankara dropping its ambition to own the S-400.\nTurkish officials in Ankara were not immediately available for comment. Turkey has said it will take delivery of the S-400s in July.\nNATO SUMMIT\nThe U.S. decision on the F-35s was expected to complicate Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu's planned visit to Washington this week for a NATO summit. On Sunday, Erdogan suffered one of his biggest electoral losses in decades in local elections.\n\"Certain Russian weapon systems are seen as inherently threatening to the United States regardless of who is operating them and for what purpose,\" Andrew Hunter, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said.\n\"Because Turkey is not just an F-35 purchaser, but an industrial partner, blocking delivery of these systems represents a major escalation by the United States as it threatens to impose serious costs on both sides,\" Hunter said.\nReuters reported last week that Washington was exploring whether it could remove Turkey from production of the F-35. Turkey makes parts of the fuselage, landing gear and cockpit displays. Sources familiar with the F-35's intricate worldwide production process and U.S. thinking on the issue last week said Turkey's role can be replaced.\nThe United States and other NATO allies that own F-35s fear the radar on the Russian S-400 missile system will learn how to spot and track the jet, making it less able to evade Russian weapons in the future.\nIn an attempt to persuade Turkey to drop its plans to buy the S-400, the United States offered the pricier American-made Patriot anti-missile system in a discounted deal that expired at the end of March. Turkey has shown interest in the Patriot system, but not at the expense of abandoning the S-400.\nTurkey has engaged with U.S. negotiators in recent days about buying the Patriot system, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.

The aircraft is built by Lockheed Martin Corp.\nA Pentagon official had told Reuters in March that the United States had a number of items it could withhold in order to send Turkey a signal that the United States was serious about Ankara dropping its ambition to own the S-400.\nTurkish officials in Ankara were not immediately available for comment. Turkey has said it will take delivery of the S-400s in July.\nNATO SUMMIT\nThe U.S. decision on the F-35s was expected to complicate Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu's planned visit to Washington this week for a NATO summit. On Sunday, Erdogan suffered one of his biggest electoral losses in decades in local elections.\n\"Certain Russian weapon systems are seen as inherently threatening to the United States regardless of who is operating them and for what purpose,\" Andrew Hunter, a fellow at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said.\n\"Because Turkey is not just an F-35 purchaser, but an industrial partner, blocking delivery of these systems represents a major escalation by the United States as it threatens to impose serious costs on both sides,\" Hunter said.\nReuters reported last week that Washington was exploring whether it could remove Turkey from production of the F-35. Turkey makes parts of the fuselage, landing gear and cockpit displays. Sources familiar with the F-35's intricate worldwide production process and U.S. thinking on the issue last week said Turkey's role can be replaced.\nThe United States and other NATO allies that own F-35s fear the radar on the Russian S-400 missile system will learn how to spot and track the jet, making it less able to evade Russian weapons in the future.\nIn an attempt to persuade Turkey to drop its plans to buy the S-400, the United States offered the pricier American-made Patriot anti-missile system in a discounted deal that expired at the end of March. Turkey has shown interest in the Patriot system, but not at the expense of abandoning the S-400.\nTurkey has engaged with U.S. negotiators in recent days about buying the Patriot system, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.

Supreme Court justices are appointed for lifetime terms, and both his appointees potentially could serve for decades.\nIn response to Trump's appointments, a handful of liberal activists have argued that if Democrats win the White House in the November 2020 presidential election, they should expand the number of Supreme Court justices to tip the balance of control toward liberals.\nWhen asked, some candidates seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination have said they would consider adding more justices to the court or other reforms. However, they have not made it a central part of their policy proposals, and other Democrats have opposed such an idea.\nLong-shot liberal candidate Pete Buttigieg has mentioned a Supreme Court composed of 15 justices coupled with other reforms that would ensure partisan parity.\nWhen Trump was elected in 2016, there was a court vacancy because of the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia and the Republican-led Senate's refusal to consider Democratic President Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland.\nSome Democrats have accused Republicans of \"stealing\" a seat, pointing to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's move to block consideration of Garland and keep the position vacant until the following year so the next president could make the appointment. McConnell's action, with little precedent in U.S. history, enabled Trump to nominate Gorsuch in 2017, with the Republican-led Senate voting to confirm him.\nExpanding the court - by either party - would be difficult.\nDemocratic President Franklin Roosevelt in 1937 proposed expanding it to as many as 15 justices. Critics accused him of a \"court-packing\" scheme aimed at changing its ideological composition. The proposal went nowhere in Congress.\n(Reporting by Ginger Gibson; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)\n 06:12 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bernie sanders", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brett kavanaugh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "inger gibson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T01:58:46.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "824f83c14c5a481cb84a2fc3a45380b74361d8eb", "url": "https://www.firstpost.com/world/u-s-considering-additional-iran-sanctions-perhaps-in-may-official-6369221.html", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/firstpost/xfJh?utm_source=fp_footer", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "U.S. considering additional Iran sanctions, perhaps in May: official", "title_full": "U.S. considering additional Iran sanctions, perhaps in May: official", "published": "2019-04-02T01:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/reuters/04-2019/02/2019-04-01T203740Z_1_LYNXNPEF302LZ_RTROPTP_2_IRAN-SANCTIONS-TANKERS.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "824f83c14c5a481cb84a2fc3a45380b74361d8eb", "url": "https://www.firstpost.com/world/u-s-considering-additional-iran-sanctions-perhaps-in-may-official-6369221.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Reuters", "published": "2019-04-02T01:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "U.S. considering additional Iran sanctions, perhaps in May: official", "text": "U.S. considering additional Iran sanctions, perhaps in May: official World 05:58 IST\nBy Jeff Mason\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government is considering additional sanctions against Iran that would target areas of its economy that have not been hit before, a senior Trump administration official told reporters on Monday.\nThe official said the administration aimed to follow through with new sanctions around the first anniversary of the U.S. withdrawal from a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and several world powers, which President Donald Trump announced last May.\n\"We just want a continued chilling effect,\" the official said. \"We want businesses to continue to think doing business with Iran is a terrible idea at this point.\"\nTrump announced last May that the United States would pull out of a 2015 international agreement designed to deny Tehran the ability to make nuclear weapons and he ordered sanctions be imposed again on the country.\nThe deal, agreed by the United States, France, Britain, Germany, Russia, China and Iran, sought to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb in return for the removal of sanctions that had crippled its economy.\nThe official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the administration hoped to take the additional measures in the coming weeks.\n\"The more we can do around the anniversary, the better,\" the official said, while adding that it takes time to put such sanctions together and that the U.S. Treasury Department was working on them.\nOne of the tools the United States has employed includes sanctions on oil imports from Iran. Washington has granted waivers to eight Iranian oil buyers, but could change that.\nThe official said the United States had the ability not to give those waivers at all. \"That, I think, is where we're headed,\" the official said.\nReducing the number of waivers would limit oil exports from Iran, the fourth-largest producer in OPEC. The United States set an earlier target of driving Iranian oil exports to zero, and the official said that goal had not changed.\nU.S. domestic oil production would help offset such a change, the official said.\nChina, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey are likely to be given waivers after they expire in May that could cap Iran\u2019s crude oil exports at about 1.1 million barrels per day, U.S.-based analysts at Eurasia Group said earlier this year. That would remove Italy, Greece and Taiwan from the current waivers list.\n(Reporting by Jeff Mason; additional reporting by Florence Tan in Singapore; Editing by James Dalgleish)\n 05:58 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeff mason w", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tehran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T01:58:47.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4fadf6e7389510c9ec692a8140ce8a2de4549ca1", "url": "https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/bonds/infraestruturas-de-portugal-s-a-moody-s-announces-completion-of-a-periodic-review-of-ratings-of-infraestruturas-de-portugal-s-a-1028076391", "site_full": "markets.businessinsider.com", "site": "businessinsider.com", "site_section": "https://markets.businessinsider.com/news", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance", "options"], "section_title": "Stock Market News | Financial &amp;

Its final estimate of that growth rate is 5.62 percent compared with 4.59 percent in its February proposal.\n\"Most of the puts-and-takes remained the same as proposed, but CMS upped the growth rate, which is definitely helpful in 2020,\" said Ipsita Smolinski, managing director at healthcare research consulting firm Capitol Street.\nMedicare Advantage plans serve more than 20 million people, most of them aged 65 and older.\nShares in insurers were unchanged in after hours trading. UnitedHealth Group Inc, Humana Inc, CVS Health Corp, through its acquisition of Aetna, and WellCare Health Plans Inc are the largest sellers of Medicare Advantage health insurance.\nUnder the program, they are paid a set rate by the government to cover member healthcare costs.\nIn addition to medical costs, the government's 2020 payment rate also factors in other changes in policies, such as quality of care related payments that may result in declines or increases from year to year.\nFor instance, the 2020 rate reflected a decline in payments of 3.08 percent related to the Affordable Care Act requirement that Medicare Advantage and fee-for-service Medicare have the same payment structure.\nStarting in 2020, Medicare Advantage plans will also be able to offer supplemental non-health related benefits to chronically ill enrolees that address their social needs, CMS Administrator Seema Verma said. Those can include needed structural changes to the home, such as adding ramps and widening doorways.\nThe plans can tailor these offerings to individuals, and the offerings could increase competition between plans, Verma said.\nPreviously, plans have only been allowed to offer health related benefits.\nMedicare Advantage competes with the traditional Medicare fee-for-service program. Both have grown as the \"Baby Boomer\" generation ages into Medicare. Together, they cover more than 55 million people.\n(Reporting by Caroline Humer; Editing by Bill Berkrot)\n 06:33 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "carolin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "humer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ipsita smolinski", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "medicare", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "medicare advantage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cms", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centres for medicare & medicaid services", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T02:04:37.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "74ed85a993f70ee1518dd9457beee528ca8f954c", "url": "https://www.nasdaq.com/article/us-halts-f35-equipment-to-turkey-protests-its-plans-to-buy-from-russia-20190401-01297", "site_full": "www.nasdaq.com", "site": "nasdaq.com", "site_section": "https://www.nasdaq.com/", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Daily Stock Market Overview, Data Updates, Reports &amp; News - Nasdaq", "title": "U.S. halts F-35 equipment to Turkey, protests its plans to buy from Russia", "title_full": "U.S. halts F-35 equipment to Turkey, protests its plans to buy from Russia - Nasdaq.com", "published": "2019-04-01T13:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.834, "main_image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/images/dreamit.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2975, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "74ed85a993f70ee1518dd9457beee528ca8f954c", "url": "https://www.nasdaq.com/article/us-halts-f35-equipment-to-turkey-protests-its-plans-to-buy-from-russia-20190401-01297", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "nasdaq.com", "published": "2019-04-01T13:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "U.S. halts F-35 equipment to Turkey, protests its plans to buy from Russia", "text": "Reuters\nBy Mike Stone and Humeyra Pamuk\nWASHINGTON, April 1 (Reuters) - The United States has halted delivery of equipment related to the stealthy F-35 fighter aircraft to Turkey, marking the first concrete U.S. step to block delivery of the jet to the NATO ally in light of Ankara's planned purchase of a Russian missile defense system.\nU.S. officials told their Turkish counterparts they will not receive further shipments of F-35 related equipment needed to prepare for the arrival of the stealthy jet, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday.\n\"Pending an unequivocal Turkish decision to forgo delivery of the S-400, deliveries and activities associated with the stand-up of Turkey's F-35 operational capability have been suspended,\" Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Mike Andrews, a Defense Department spokesman, said in a statement.\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan has refused to back down from Ankara's planned purchase of a Russian S-400 missile defense system that the United States has said would compromise the security of F-35 aircraft.\nThe disagreement over the F-35 is the latest of a series of diplomatic disputes between the United States and Turkey including Turkish demands that the United States extradite Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, differences over Middle East policy and the war in Syria, and sanctions on Iran.\nThe sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the next shipment of training equipment, and all subsequent shipments of F-35 related material, had been canceled. The aircraft is built by Lockheed Martin Corp.\nA Pentagon official had told Reuters in March that the United States had a number of items it could withhold in order to send Turkey a signal that the United States was serious about Ankara dropping its ambition to own the S-400.\nTurkish officials in Ankara were not immediately available for comment. Turkey has said it will take delivery of the S-400s in July.\nNATO SUMMIT\nThe U.S. decision on the F-35s was expected to complicate Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu's planned visit to Washington this week for a NATO summit. On Sunday, Erdogan suffered one of his biggest electoral losses in decades in local elections.\n\"Certain Russian weapon systems are seen as inherently threatening to the United States regardless of who is operating them and for what purpose,\" Andrew Hunter, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said.\n\"Because Turkey is not just an F-35 purchaser, but an industrial partner, blocking delivery of these systems represents a major escalation by the United States as it threatens to impose serious costs on both sides,\" Hunter said.\nReuters reported last week that Washington was exploring whether it could remove Turkey from production of the F-35. Turkey makes parts of the fuselage, landing gear and cockpit displays. Sources familiar with the F-35's intricate worldwide production process and U.S. thinking on the issue last week said Turkey's role can be replaced.\nThe United States and other NATO allies that own F-35s fear the radar on the Russian S-400 missile system will learn how to spot and track the jet, making it less able to evade Russian weapons in the future.\nIn an attempt to persuade Turkey to drop its plans to buy the S-400, the United States offered the pricier American-made Patriot anti-missile system in a discounted deal that expired at the end of March. Turkey has shown interest in the Patriot system, but not at the expense of abandoning the S-400.\nTurkey has engaged with U.S. negotiators in recent days about buying the Patriot system, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The system is made by Raytheon Co.\nTurkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar in March said that despite some issues, Turkish pilots were continuing their training at an air base in Arizona on the F-35, each of which costs $90 million, and that Ankara was expecting the aircraft to arrive in Turkey in November.\nU.S. lawmakers also have expressed alarm over Turkey's planned purchase of the Russian system. Four U.S. senators last week introduced a bipartisan bill that would prohibit the transfer of F-35s to Turkey until the U.S. government certifies that Ankara will not take delivery of the S-400 system.\nFollowing news of the halt, U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, one of the bill sponsors said she was glad to hear the administration was \"to delay the transfer of F-35 equipment to Turkey to help ensure U.S. military technology and capabilities cannot fall into the hands of the Kremlin.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://api.trkd.thomsonreuters.com/api/topnews/topnews-images/2019-04-01T183541Z_1_PJ5_RTRLXPP_2_LYNXPACKAGER.JPG.ashx"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mike stone", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "humeyra pamuk", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mike andrews", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defense department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T02:05:36.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eb60083daa0c850c75d6617d51f0bf1d49448adc", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-roy-paynter-receives-honour-for-accomplishments-special-olympics-1.5079818?cmp=rss", "site_full": "www.cbc.ca", "site": "cbc.ca", "site_section": "http://www.cbc.ca/cmlink/1.1244475", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CBC | Latest News News", "title": "P.E.I.'s Roy Paynter receives honour after 'life changing' Special Olympics World Games", "title_full": "P.E.I.'s Roy Paynter receives honour after 'life changing' Special Olympics World Games | CBC News", "published": "2019-04-02T04:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5059571.1552758604!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/roy-paynter-special-olympics-bronze.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1123, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb60083daa0c850c75d6617d51f0bf1d49448adc", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-roy-paynter-receives-honour-for-accomplishments-special-olympics-1.5079818?cmp=rss", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cbc.ca", "published": "2019-04-02T04:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "P.E.I.'s Roy Paynter receives honour after 'life changing' Special Olympics World Games", "text": "After cleaning up at the Special Olympics World Games in the United Arab Emirates last month, Roy Paynter was honoured for his accomplishments by MP Wayne Easter Monday afternoon in the House of Commons.\n\"Roy, you are a role model and you have made your country, your province and your community proud,\" said Easter. \"On behalf of Canada, thank you Roy and congratulations.\"\nPaynter, 21, came home with four medals \u2014 two golds, a silver and a bronze.\n\"It was amazing.

Industry trends have been supporting healthy growth lately, and the retailer has outpaced peers thanks to booming demand online and a flood of popular apparel innovations. But Lululemon found a way to stretch past even those high expectations. On Wednesday, the chain surpassed management's guidance for the fourth straight quarter while issuing an aggressive outlook for the new year. A woman doing yoga in front of French doors open to a courtyard filled with plants More Image source: Getty Images. Sales growth held up Sales landed well above the upgraded guidance that CEO Calvin McDonald and his team issued back in early December . Comparable-store sales spiked 17% after accounting for currency swings, as customer traffic improved both online and at Lululemon's physical stores. In contrast to Nike (NYSE: NKE) , the sporting apparel chain noted hardly any slowdown between the third and fourth quarters. Nike has been attacking the yoga apparel niche more directly lately, but the moves haven't knocked Lululemon off of its growth game. The outperformance meant that Lululemon reported $1.2 billion in revenue for the quarter, a 27% increase year over year. Executives just three months ago targeted sales of roughly $1.1 billion, which would have marked a 20%-plus spike. Commenting on the broader full-year results, management said the company \"delivered one of its strongest years yet, as a result of broad-based strength across the business.\" Profitability improved The retailer also notched a few notable financial wins. A steady drumbeat of new product releases, plus the shift toward higher-margin online sales, helped gross profit margin jump to 54.4% of sales from 52.2% a year ago. Nike's comparable figure rose to 45.1% of sales from 43.8% over roughly the same period. Lululemon held the line on expenses, too, so that operating margin increased to 18.2% of sales from 17.4%. Together, these positive shifts delivered pre-tax income of $138 million compared to $108 million a year ago. \"The trends we've seen all year in traffic, guest engagement, and product margin,\" COO Stuart Haselden said in the investor conference call , \"contributed to our nearly 40% increase in adjusted [earnings per share] in the quarter.\" The outlook is brighter Those successes allowed Lululemon to meet or exceed its 2020 goals for operating margin, gross margin, and e-commerce penetration, which just passed 26% of the broader business. Achieving those targets two years ahead of schedule gave management confidence to predict solid sales and earnings growth ahead, with revenue set to rise 12% to between $3.7 billion and $3.74 billion. Earnings should land somewhere between $4.48 and $4.55 per share compared to adjusted profit of $3.84 in fiscal 2018. That per-share earnings forecast is likely a bit conservative because it doesn't factor in the significant stock repurchase spending that management will make this year. \"We believe that repurchasing our shares is an efficient and effective sway to return excess cash to shareholders,\" CFO PJ Guido said, \"and we'll continue to be opportunistic with our repurchase activity.\" But the better news for shareholders is that Lululemon is ahead of schedule in its plan to surpass $4 billion of annual sales by 2020. And with cash pouring into the business, the chain has plenty of resources it can dedicate toward supporting its gathering sales momentum both online and across its physical store footprint.

UnitedHealth Group Inc, Humana Inc, CVS Health Corp, through its acquisition of Aetna, and WellCare Health Plans Inc are the largest sellers of Medicare Advantage health insurance.\nUnder the program, they are paid a set rate by the government to cover member healthcare costs.\nIn addition to medical costs, the government's 2020 payment rate also factors in other changes in policies, such as quality of care related payments that may result in declines or increases from year to year.\nFor instance, the 2020 rate reflected a decline in payments of 3.08 percent related to the Affordable Care Act requirement that Medicare Advantage and fee-for-service Medicare have the same payment structure.\nStarting in 2020, Medicare Advantage plans will also be able to offer supplemental non-health related benefits to chronically ill enrollees that address their social needs, CMS Administrator Seema Verma said. Those can include needed structural changes to the home, such as adding ramps and widening doorways.\nThe plans can tailor these offerings to individuals, and the offerings could increase competition between plans, Verma said.\nPreviously, plans have only been allowed to offer health related benefits.\nMedicare Advantage competes with the traditional Medicare fee-for-service program. Both have grown as the \"Baby Boomer\" generation ages into Medicare.

That's what Vice Adm. Bill Merz, the deputy chief of naval operations, told a House of Representatives subcommittee on March 27, 2019. \"We\u2019re expecting a pretty hard look at the mix of ships this year,\" Merz said, according to USNI News. The U.S. Navy's New Plan: Lots of Frigates That Can Do a Lot of Damage\nThe U.S. Navy might tweak its force-structure goals in order to boost the number of frigates.\nThat's what Vice Adm. Bill Merz, the deputy chief of naval operations, told a House of Representatives subcommittee on March 27, 2019. \"We\u2019re expecting a pretty hard look at the mix of ships this year,\" Merz said, according to USNI News.\nIn rewriting the force-structure plan to include more small surface combatants, the Navy could signal its intention to acquire larger numbers of smaller ships at the expense of bigger ships.\nThe idea would be to distribute U.S. naval power across a greater number of less-expensive vessels, reversing a decades-long trend toward larger, and fewer U.S. warships.\n\"We know we are heavy on large surface combatants, and we\u2019d like to adjust that to a more appropriate mix, especially with the lethality we\u2019re seeing coming along with the frigate,\" Merz said.\nThe Navy's released its last force-structure plan in late 2016. That plan , which called for a fleet of 355 major warships, up from the 289 ships the Navy possessed in early 2019. The new, bigger fleet would include 104 large surface combatants such as destroyers and cruisers and 52 small surface combatants including Littoral Combat Ships and frigates.\nBut the Navy is struggling to afford the 355-ship fleet. The 2020 edition of the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan projects the fleet could grow to 355 ships by 2034. But the Congressional Budget Office estimated that just buying all the new vessels would cost $27 billion per year, roughly double what the Navy historically has spent.\nReducing the number of large warships and adding frigates could help to reduce the cost of a larger fleet. A 9,000-ton-displacement Arleigh Burke -class destroyer costs more than $2 billion. A frigate, displacing just 5,000 tons, should cost around $1 billion, according to the Navy.\nBut the frigate still could carry many of the same weapons and sensors that a destroyer does, although somewhat fewer of them.\nAccording to a Navy document that the Congressional Research Service obtained, the frigate will come armed with a 57-millimeter gun, a 32-cell vertical missile-launcher for SM-2 Block IIIC and Evolved Sea Sparrow missiles, a 21-round point-defense Rolling Airframe Missile launcher and eight launchers for over-the-horizon anti-ship missiles.\nIts radar and combat system will be a smaller version of the Aegis system that equips the Navy's destroyers and cruisers. The frigate will embark an MH-60R helicopter and an MQ-8C drone. That weapons and sensor suite should give the frigate the ability to engage enemy aircraft, ships and submarines at a distance of 100 miles or more.\nOver time, the ship could gain additional weaponry. The Navy document refers to potential upgrades for the frigate including a 150-kilowatt laser and an anti-submarine missile, which could be a rocket-boosted torpedo similar in concept to the defunct ASROC missile.\nBut the SM-2 Block IIIC, of which the frigate could carry 32, could be the new ship's most potent weapon. The Block IIIC replaces the semi-active radar-homing seeker on older SM-2s with the active radar-homing seeker of the SM-6 missile. The SM-6's seeker itself is a derivative of the Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile.\nWith a semi-active missile, the launching ship must use its own radar to guide the missile through most of its flight. An active missile has its own, tiny radar, allowing the ship to launch and leave, thus protecting it from retaliatory strikes.\nThe SM-2 Block IIIC can do much more than just shoot down aircraft. With small tweaks to the seeker, the Navy already has given the SM-6 and SM-2 Block IIIC missiles anti-ship capability. Additional tweaks could allow the SM-6 -- and by extension the SM-2 Block IIIC -- to hit targets on land.\nThe new frigate also could function as a command vessel for robotic vessels, using Link 11 and Link 16 data links, satellite communications and Network Tactical Common Data Link to help the unmanned vessels to navigate and also to authorize them to fire weapons.\nThe Navy soon could select a shipyard to build the new class of frigate starting in 2020. \"All shipyards have agreed that they can give us the lethality we need,\" Merz said.\nThe old fleet plan called for 20 of the vessels. A new plan could boost that number.\nDavid Axe serves as Defense Editor of the National Interest.

More Intel (INTC) closed at $54.51 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.51% move from the prior day. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 1.16% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 1.27%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.29%. Prior to today's trading, shares of the world's largest chipmaker had gained 1.4% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.18% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.92% in that time. Wall Street will be looking for positivity from INTC as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be April 25, 2019. In that report, analysts expect INTC to post earnings of $0.87 per share. This would mark no growth from the year-ago period. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $16.01 billion, down 0.33% from the year-ago period. For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.50 per share and revenue of $70.71 billion, which would represent changes of -1.75% and -0.19%, respectively, from the prior year. Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for INTC. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability. Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model. The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. INTC is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Valuation is also important, so investors should note that INTC has a Forward P/E ratio of 11.92 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 17.02, so we one might conclude that INTC is trading at a discount comparatively. Also, we should mention that INTC has a PEG ratio of 1.42. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Semiconductor - General industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.26 as of yesterday's close. The Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector.

Korea, U.S. reaffirm commitment to support inter-Korean military accord\n(ATTN: CHANGES dateline; RECASTS headline, lead; UPDATES throughout)\nWASHINGTON/SEOUL, April 2 (Yonhap) -- The defense chiefs of South Korea and the United States have reaffirmed their commitment to closely coordinating to support last year's inter-Korean military accord aimed at reducing border tensions and building trust, their offices said.\nDuring their talks in Washington on Monday, Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo and acting U.S. Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan also reiterated their will to closely cooperate to expedite the fulfillment of conditions needed for Washington's envisioned transfer of wartime operational control (OPCON) to Seoul.\nJeong and Shanahan met face to face for the first time since the latter took the Pentagon post in January.\n\"The secretary and the minister assessed that implementation of the Comprehensive Military Agreement (CMA) has contributed to the easing of military tension and confidence building on the Korean Peninsula,\" Seoul's defense ministry and the Pentagon said in a press release.\nThe Koreas' defense chiefs signed the CMA at the close of the third summit between President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang last September. It entails a series of trust-building and arms control measures under a broader scheme to halt all hostile acts against each other.\nJeong and Shanahan underscored their will to closely cooperate to further reinforce the alliance through the \"synchronized\" efforts of their militaries amid ongoing peace efforts with North Korea.\n\"The secretary and minister affirmed that the U.S.-ROK Alliance is 'ironclad' and ready to face an evolving security environment,\" the press release reads.\n\"The two sides reaffirmed the commitment to maintain an unwavering combined readiness posture while continuing to support the ongoing diplomatic efforts to achieve complete denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula,\" it added.\nGen. Robert Abrams, the commander of the South Korea-U.S. Combined Forces Command, gave the defense chiefs an evaluation of the allies' recently revised exercise, saying that they have strengthened the militaries' combined readiness and contributed to the groundwork for the OPCON transfer.\nAbrams was referring to the recently concluded Dong Maeng command post exercise that replaced the springtime Key Resolve exercise. Dong Maeng is the Korean word for alliance.\nJeong and Shanahan also agreed to work toward initial operational capability (IOC) certification of a South Korea-led combined defense posture later this year, and committed to stay in close consultation, the press release said.\nSeoul and Washington have been pushing for the conditions-based OPCON transfer after which the former will lead wartime operations with the latter playing a supporting role.\nFollowing the IOC certification slated for this summer, the two sides are expected to verify Seoul's full operational and mission capabilities in the following years.\nBefore their talks, Shanahan said that the allies learned \"lessons\" from the Dong Maeng exercise and will look to apply them to future drills.\n\"Our teams play a vital role in support of diplomacy,\" Shanahan said.\nThe recent exercise was \"very successful,\" he said, but, \"We've also learned about improvements we can make in our fall exercises.\"\nThis photo shows South Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo (L) meeting with acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan (R) at the Pentagon, near Washington, on April 1, 2019.

The probes cover the 2011 through 2014 Hyundai Sonata and Santa Fe, the 2011 through 2014 Kia Optima and Sorento, and the 2010 through 2015 Kia Soul. The complaints came from consumers and from data provided by both automakers.\nOne death was reported involving a Kia vehicle, according to the documents.\nNHTSA had previously said it would incorporate the noncrash fires into a 2017 investigation that examined recalls of Hyundai and Kia vehicles for engine failures. It opened the new probes \"based on the agency's analysis of information received from multiple manufacturers, consumer complaints and other sources.\"\nJason Levine, executive director of the centre, said in a statement that it is long past time for the agency to investigate why so many Kia and Hyundai vehicles have caught fire when not involved in crashes.\n\"While it may be six months post-due, we are gratified to see NHTSA's Office of Defect Investigations open formal investigations based on our petition,\" Levine said.\nThe centre contended that there are more noncrash fires in the Hyundai and Kia cars and SUVs than in similar vehicles made by other automakers.\nHyundai and Kia said in statements that they're co-operating with the investigations and have been open and transparent with NHTSA, providing comprehensive data. Messages were left seeking comment from NHTSA.\nIn documents detailing the investigations, NHTSA reported that it had received complaints of engine compartment fires, as well as fires involving other components including tail light housings, wiring harnesses, and light bulbs. Agency investigators sent information requests to both automakers in September and October of last year, according to the documents.\nThe investigation will look into how often fires happen, how many vehicles are affected and the safety-related consequences, the documents said.\nEngine failure and fire problems with Hyundais and Kias have affected more than 6 million vehicles since 2015, according to NHTSA documents. So far, Hyundai and Kia have recalled about 2.4 million vehicles to fix problems that can cause fires and engine failures.\nIn addition, the automakers are doing a \"product improvement campaign\" covering another 3.7 million vehicles to install software that will alert drivers of possible engine failures and send the cars into a reduced-speed \"limp\" mode if problems are detected.\nJust last Friday, NHTSA announced a recall of about 20,000 Veloster cars with 1.6-litre engines in the U.S. and Canada because fuel can prematurely ignite in the cylinders around the pistons. That can cause excessive pressure and damage the engine, causing vehicles to stall and in some cases catch fire.\nBut that's a different problem from what has caused the rest of the recalls since 2015.\nIn February, Kia announced that it would recall the Soul small SUV with the same-size engine due to engine failure and fire problems, but for reasons unrelated to the Veloster's issues.\nMost of the engine failure recalls are for problems with Hyundai's 2.4-litre and 2-litre \"Theta II\" four-cylinder engines. Debris left from manufacturing can clog a port and cut off the flow of oil, causing the connecting rod bearings to fail. That can damage the engine block and cause oil to leak and catch fire. The automakers also have announced recalls to inspect a fuel pipe problem that can cause leaks and fires.\nLevine has said fire complaints to NHTSA have come from across the country, including a death in Ohio involving a Kia Soul in April of 2017. Kia says the driver in that incident damaged the transmission by pushing on the brake and gas pedal at the same time, causing transmission fluid to leak and catch fire. It's not clear whether this death is the one cited in NHTSA's figures.\nKia's statement said it will keep working with NHTSA \"in achieving our mutual goal of protecting U.S. vehicle passengers.\"\nHyundai's statement said it is monitoring the performance of its engines on the roads and it has made numerous improvements to its engine manufacturing. The company also said it has made \"substantial efforts\" to address engine issues in some of its vehicles.\nDuring a two-year period starting in November of 2016, Hyundai did fire-related inspections of 428 vehicles out of the roughly 8.7 million vehicles it has on the road today. The statement says that for every 1 million Hyundai vehicles on the road, 49 had a noncrash fire during those two years.\nBut the Highway Loss Data Institute, an insurance industry group, found that owners of five Hyundai and Kia cars and SUVs filed fire insurance claims at a rate far higher than comparable vehicles. The institute found that some Hyundai and Kia vehicles with four-cylinder engines have at least double the noncrash fire claim rates than the average of comparable vehicles.\nRelated Stories Hyundai finds new engine problem, prompting another recall", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom krisher", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kia", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hyundai", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "center for auto safety", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul motor show", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kia soul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kia optima", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyundai motor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national highway traffic safety administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyundai sonata", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa fe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goyang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "detroit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T02:23:59.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b90a143041186c16b27ef661e23c977d2c758caf", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/u-considering-additional-iran-sanctions-perhaps-may-u-203553695.html", "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/world/", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "media", "tech"], "section_title": "World | Yahoo News - Latest News &amp; Headlines", "title": "U.S. considering additional Iran sanctions, perhaps in May: official", "title_full": "U.S. considering additional Iran sanctions, perhaps in May: official", "published": "2019-04-02T05:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gvgJ_Tdrrz51xwf2dYhVGw--~B/aD0yNDg7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2019-04-01T203553Z_1_LYNXNPEF302LY_RTROPTP_2_IRAN-SANCTIONS-TANKERS.JPG", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b90a143041186c16b27ef661e23c977d2c758caf", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/u-considering-additional-iran-sanctions-perhaps-may-u-203553695.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jeff Mason", "published": "2019-04-02T05:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "U.S. considering additional Iran sanctions, perhaps in May: official", "text": "By Jeff Mason WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government is considering additional sanctions against Iran that would target areas of its economy that have not been hit before, a senior Trump administration official told reporters on Monday.\nThe official said the administration aimed to follow through with new sanctions around the first anniversary of the U.S. withdrawal from a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and several world powers, which President Donald Trump announced last May.\n\"We just want a continued chilling effect,\" the official said. \"We want businesses to continue to think doing business with Iran is a terrible idea at this point.\"\nTrump announced last May that the United States would pull out of a 2015 international agreement designed to deny Tehran the ability to make nuclear weapons and he ordered sanctions be imposed again on the country.\nThe deal, agreed by the United States, France, Britain, Germany, Russia, China and Iran, sought to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb in return for the removal of sanctions that had crippled its economy.\nThe official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the administration hoped to take the additional measures in the coming weeks.\n\"The more we can do around the anniversary, the better,\" the official said, while adding that it takes time to put such sanctions together and that the U.S. Treasury Department was working on them.\nOne of the tools the United States has employed includes sanctions on oil imports from Iran. Washington has granted waivers to eight Iranian oil buyers, but could change that.\nThe official said the United States had the ability not to give those waivers at all. \"That, I think, is where we're headed,\" the official said.\nReducing the number of waivers would limit oil exports from Iran, the fourth-largest producer in OPEC. The United States set an earlier target of driving Iranian oil exports to zero, and the official said that goal had not changed.\nU.S. domestic oil production would help offset such a change, the official said.\nChina, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey are likely to be given waivers after they expire in May that could cap Iran\u2019s crude oil exports at about 1.1 million barrels per day, U.S.-based analysts at Eurasia Group said earlier this year. That would remove Italy, Greece and Taiwan from the current waivers list.\n(Reporting by Jeff Mason; additional reporting by Florence Tan in Singapore; Editing by James Dalgleish)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeff mason", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tehran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T02:24:55.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b032ec4edfc1e27f85a18ad3b32228db3df55093", "url": "https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2019-04-01/us-vice-president-to-meet-families-of-citgo-workers-detained-in-venezuela", "site_full": "www.usnews.com", "site": "usnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.usnews.com/rss/usnews.rss", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "U.S. News", "title": "U.S. Vice President to Meet Families of Citgo Workers Detained in Venezuela", "title_full": "U.S. Vice President to Meet Families of Citgo Workers Detained in Venezuela", "published": "2019-04-02T01:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/b86a3da/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcom-usnews-beam-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2F06%2Fc3296d9d562b4e48dc92fa1fc0d66a%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2019%3Anewsml_LYNXNPEF302QQ%3A12019-04-01T224736Z_1_LYNXNPEF302QQ_RTROPTP_3_VENEZUELA-POLITICS-USA.JPG", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1027, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b032ec4edfc1e27f85a18ad3b32228db3df55093", "url": "https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2019-04-01/us-vice-president-to-meet-families-of-citgo-workers-detained-in-venezuela", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T01:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "U.S. Vice President to Meet Families of Citgo Workers Detained in Venezuela", "text": "U.S. Vice President to Meet Families of Citgo Workers Detained in Venezuela April 1, 2019 FILE PHOTO - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence listens as President Donald Trump meets with Fabiana Rosales, wife of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, U.S., March 27, 2019.

A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the U.S. economy.\n\"ISM Manufacturing for March came in above expectations and employment remains below cycle peaks but comfortably back near prevailing levels in 2018, as March showed the biggest one-month increase in three years. This points to a potentially strong NFP on Friday,\" BMO said in a note.\nThe stronger-than-expected ISM manufacturing data eased worries about slowing economic growth following signs of subdued U.S. consumer growth amid weaker-than-expected retail sales.\nThe Commerce Department said on Monday that retail sales fell 0.2% in February . That confounded economists\u2019 forecast for a 0.3% rise. The retail sales control group \u2013 which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP \u2013 fell 0.2% , missing expectations for a 0.4% increase.\nThe retail sales report provides the \"most significant hard data support for the market\u2019s pessimistic outlook, and it looks like this will remain the case for another month,\" Action Economics said.\nBut the dollar struggled to turn positive as sterling racked up gains ahead of a second round of votes due 3 PM ET (19:00 GMT) on a series of options that could help break the current impasse in parliament on the path for Brexit just weeks ahead of the latest EU Brexit deadline on April 12.\nThe four options to be voted on include a call on the government to negotiate a permanent customs union, the U.K joining the European Free Trade Association and European Economic Area (Common Market 2.0), a confirmatory public vote on the Brexit deal and a choice between no-deal Brexit or revoking Article 50 - stopping Brexit - if the EU does not agree to an extension.\nAmong the four options, a permanent customs union and a confirmatory public vote on the Brexit deal secured the most votes in the first round of voting last week.\nThe results of the vote are expected to come at around 5 PM ET (21:00 GMT).\nIf the options fail to gain majority support, a third round of votes is pencilled in for Wednesday.

But January production was published as lower m-o-m by 91k b/d to 11.872 mb/d.\nMore important, however, is that our method of tracking US oil production shows a stalled growth outlook for Q1 2019.\nYou can see the trued-up US oil production figure projected a drop m-o-m before the EIA 914 was published. This means that February would likely see a bump up to ~12 mb/d before falling in March.\nFor those that are following the oil market fundamentals closely, this is the exact same bullish scenario we laid out at the end of 2018.\nIn an article we published titled, \" For The Permian, It's Not 2016 - And That's Bad News For U.S. Shale \", we said:\nWith oil prices where it is today, the market is completely ignoring the fact of what happens to the supply/demand equation if US shale just slows down for 3 months. We are not even talking about a decline in production but a mere flattening of production for 3 months.\nAnd, given the recent data we see in the EIA weekly reports and the latest EIA 914, we have strong confidence that US oil production did indeed finish the first 3 months of 2019 flat.\nWhile there are oil bulls that point to falling Permian rig counts as another factor, we do want to remind everyone that it's well completion that matters, not rigs that drive oil production growth.\nNonetheless, with US oil production flat for the first 3 months of 2019, we expect US oil production to start growing in April and finish the year around ~12.9 mb/d. This would an increase of ~1 mb/d or a 50% reduction from the exit-to-exit growth we saw between 2018 and 2017.\nBy 2020, the lower exit-to-exit growth will become more apparent in the year-over-year growth rates. Keep in mind that 2019 is skewed by the high exit production, so the year-over-year growth will still be ~1.8+ mb/d (total liquids).\nThank you for reading this article.

Many believe the technical signal could portend more gains for stocks in the short term.\nGains in global equities were spurred by data showing that China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly returned to growth in March for the first time in four months.\n\"The Chinese numbers bounced back, and people are taking more risk today because of it,\" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.\nU.S. manufacturing numbers for March were also better than expected, helping investors overlook soft retail sales data for February.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 329.74 points, or 1.27 percent, to 26,258.42, the S&P 500 gained 32.79 points, or 1.16 percent, to 2,867.19, and the Nasdaq Composite added 99.59 points, or 1.29 percent, to 7,828.91.\nConcerns about a global economic slowdown have dimmed sentiment since the Federal Reserve announced in late January that its monetary tightening would end earlier than expected, as it cited \"cross currents\" affecting the economy. The shift in Fed policy drove yields on 10-year Treasury notes below those of three-month bills last week for the first time in more than a decade.\nYields on 10-year notes have since risen back above three-month bill rates and on Monday hit a one-week high. Monday's rise in the 10-year Treasury yield helped lift financial shares, which provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500 among the index's 11 sectors. S&P 500 bank shares jumped 2.9 percent.\n\"Treasury yields had priced in a gloomy outlook, and now they're unwinding some of that negativity,\" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. \"So we're seeing money moving back into cyclical areas, which is why financials are big leaders today.\"\nConcerns about slowing momentum have not entirely dissipated. With the first-quarter corporate earnings reporting season about two weeks away, investors are bracing for what may be the first U.S. profit decline since 2016. Analysts expect quarterly earnings to fall 2 percent, according to Refinitiv data.\nStill, on Monday, most S&P sectors rose. Only consumer staples, real estate and utilities shares, which tend to decline as 10-year Treasury yields rise, were in the red.\nAuto shares rose after China's State Council said on Sunday that the country would continue to suspend additional tariffs on import of U.S. vehicles and auto parts after April 1.\nGeneral Motors Co shares added 1.8 percent and Ford Motor Co shares gained 2.3 percent.\nChipmakers, which draw much of their revenue from China, also rose. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index advanced 2.5 percent.\nShares of Wynn Resorts Ltd jumped 8.4 percent, the most among S&P 500 companies, as March gambling revenue from the Chinese territory of Macau rose from the previous month.\nLyft Inc shares tumbled 11.9 percent to end below their IPO price after brokerage Guggenheim Securities started coverage of the ride-hailing company's shares with a \"neutral\" rating.

As dairy farmers across the country continue to face severe challenges with low prices and market instability, the 2018 Farm Bill dramatically expands support for dairy producers, providing flexible, affordable coverage options through the Dairy Margin Coverage program. Early analysis has shown that the improvements would provide much-needed financial tools to dairy farmers \u2013 providing significant benefits for all operations and ensuring the program addresses the particular challenges facing small and medium-sized family farms.\n\u201cThe situation for dairy farmers is urgent,\u201d the Senators wrote. \u201cAlthough Dairy Margin Coverage is effective as of January 1, 2019, the government shutdown delayed action on 2018 Farm Bill implementation for over a month. During this time, dairy farmers have continued to face market instability and are struggling to survive the fourth year of sustained low prices.\u201d\n\u201cThe changes to the Dairy Margin Coverage program make it a much more flexible policy that will likely benefit many of the farmers who chose not to participate in the Margin Protection Program. The USDA should strongly encourage these farmers to consider the Dairy Margin Coverage program,\u201d wrote the Senators.\n\u201cIn the interim, we request that the USDA invest in outreach, training, coordination with partner organizations, and staffing to ensure that every eligible farmer receives personalized information about the new and improved options,\u201d wrote the Senators.\nSenator Baldwin pushed for several other important changes to the 2018 Farm Bill to address the needs of dairy producers, including: a partial refund or credits from premiums paid under the former Margin Protection Program and a provision that allows producers to enroll in both DMC and Livestock Gross Margin for Dairy at the same time.\nThe letter, led by Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Roy Blunt (R-MO), was also signed by Senators Michael F. Bennet (D-CO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Thomas R. Carper (D-DE), Robert P. Casey, Jr. (D-PA), Susan M. Collins (R-ME), Christopher A.

When he was pulling me in, I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth.\u201d\nLappos, 43, said she was volunteering for U.S. Rep. Jim Himes in 2009 when the alleged event took place at a fundraiser for Himes, for whom Lappos was a congressional aide.\n\"I never filed a complaint, to be honest, because he was the vice president. I was a nobody,\" Lappos said. \"There's absolutely a line of decency. There's a line of respect. Crossing that line is not grandfatherly. It's not cultural. It's not affection. It's sexism or misogyny.\"\nBiden was recently accused of similar inappropriate touching of former Nevada Assemblywoman Lucy Flores in 2014.\nA spokesperson for Biden issued a statement Sunday on the Flores accusation.\n\"In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort. And not once \u2014 never \u2014 did I believe I acted inappropriately,\" Biden said in the statement. \"If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention. I may not recall these moments the same way, and I may be surprised at what I hear. But we have arrived at an important time when women feel they can and should relate their experiences, and men should pay attention. And I will.\"\nSen. Elizabeth Warren and former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, both 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, have pressed Biden to answer or respond to the accusations.\nBiden, 76, is the frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic primary in most polling data, this despite the fact he hasn\u2019t declared yet if he will run.\nHimes first learned of Lappos\u2019s allegation on Monday and did not comment, the Courant reported.\nThe Courant reported the fundraiser where Lappos claimed she was inappropriately touched by Biden was a $1,000-per-plate event at the home at the home of Ron Moelis, a developer of affordable housing. Biden spoke at the event, which was attended by future Gov. Dannel P. malloy and future Sen.s Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy.\nThere were photos taken at the fundraiser, which was of-limits to the media, the report said.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "https://www.courant.com/politics/hc-pol-biden-grabbed-aide-20190401-vl7chim3hrdjtcwu2tszrhozzm-story.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joe biden", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lappos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim himes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "biden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy lappos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "himes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hartford courant", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T02:38:10.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a28945effc7e3fc0d02cebbf60f0c1547c247015", "url": "https://www.firstpost.com/world/u-s-vice-president-to-meet-families-of-citgo-workers-detained-in-venezuela-6369351.html", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.firstpost.com/feed/rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "U.S. vice president to meet families of Citgo workers detained in Venezuela", "title_full": "U.S. vice president to meet families of Citgo workers detained in Venezuela", "published": "2019-04-02T02:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/reuters/04-2019/02/2019-04-01T225231Z_1_LYNXNPEF302QX_RTROPTP_2_VENEZUELA-POLITICS-USA.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a28945effc7e3fc0d02cebbf60f0c1547c247015", "url": "https://www.firstpost.com/world/u-s-vice-president-to-meet-families-of-citgo-workers-detained-in-venezuela-6369351.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Reuters", "published": "2019-04-02T02:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "U.S. vice president to meet families of Citgo workers detained in Venezuela", "text": "U.S. vice president to meet families of Citgo workers detained in Venezuela World 05:06:01 IST\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is slated to meet on Tuesday at the White House with family members of six executives from Citgo Petroleum jailed in Venezuela since 2017, a White House official said on Monday.\n\"The vice president will reiterate the administration\u2019s deep concern for the welfare and safety of all wrongfully detained American citizens,\" the White House official said, adding that Pence will call on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to \"release all political prisoners immediately and unconditionally.\"\n(Reporting by Roberta Rampton; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)\n 05:06:01 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lisa shumaker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicolas maduro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike pence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roberta rampton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "citgo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reuters welcome", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "citgo petroleum", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venezuela u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T02:38:31.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a039fe4700c069099d52d00de4e1544d7c1a4ee8", "url": "http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201904/02/WS5ca29ee1a3104842260b3cb5.html", "site_full": "www.chinadaily.com.cn", "site": "chinadaily.com.cn", "site_section": "http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china", "site_categories": ["media", "travel", "japan"], "section_title": "China News - Headlines, Stories &amp;#38; Videos - Chinadaily.com.cn", "title": "Severe weather expected in S.

Water had accumulated in many sections of the island. [ZHANG MAO/FOR CHINA DAILY] Convective weather, characterized by strong wind, hail and thunderstorms, is forecast to hit many areas in southern China this month, the national observatory said.\nOn Monday, the central and southern parts of the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region and southwestern Guangdong province were struck by convective weather from 5 am to 8 am, with precipitation per hour up to 20 to 60 millimeters, according to the National Meteorological Center.\nRainfall in Aotou township in Maoming, Guangdong, reached 127 mm per hour in places between Sunday morning and Monday morning, the Guangdong meteorological administration said.\nConvective weather, in which warm air currents rapidly push high into the sky and form plumes of thunderclouds, can be destructive. It is widely listed globally behind typhoons, earthquakes and floods for destructiveness. Extreme weather events can happen in an area as small as a few dozen square meters, though it usually affects dozens of or several hundred square kilometers. Convective weather is typically short-lived as well: Some events may last for only a few minutes.\nAs of the end of March, southern China had been stricken this year by seven convective weather events affecting two or more provincial regions, according to Chen Tao, a chief forecaster at the center.\n\"Generally speaking, there are slightly more of the weather events this year, which also came a little bit earlier,\" he said, adding that it's hard to forecast the frequency of devastating events.\nMore of the extreme weather, however, is on the way. Brief, strong rainfall, with hourly precipitation of 20 to 40 mm was expected to occur in some areas in five provincial regions, including Guizhou, Yunnan and Hainan provinces from 2 pm Monday to 8 am Tuesday, and some areas in these regions will also experience thunderstorms, with strong winds and hail.\nTwo more events are expected to occur in the southern parts of China from Tuesday to Thursday, and from March 8 to 10. The eastern part of Guizhou will be affected by both events forecasters said.\nBrief, strong winds and rain in a convective weather event can be as strong as in the eyes of super typhoons and may take down buildings of sink vessels. The local strength of a super tornado generated by convection can be far beyond that of the strongest typhoon, Chen said.\nIn convective weather, temperatures in the upper air mass usually lag behind that of lower, moist air, creating strong, upwelling air currents.

Last month, GM CEO Mary Barra closed the Lordstown plant, a decision expected to result in the layoff of more than 8,000 American workers in the area, and allegedly blamed the UAW for the plant\u2019s closure in a phone conversation with President Trump.\n\u201cJust spoke to Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors about the Lordstown Ohio plant \u2026 I asked her to sell it or do something quickly. She blamed the UAW Union \u2014 I don\u2019t care, I just want it open!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\nNew details from Bloomberg News reveal a very different story. Documents note that the UAW agreed to make nearly $120 million a year in concessions to keep the Lordstown plant open in 2017 and were stunned by the announcement in late 2018 that the Lordstown plant would eventually close.\nDan Morgan, shop chairman of UAW Local 1112, detailed the concessions to Bloomberg News that GM workers at the Lordstown plant were willing and ready to make before Barra decided to close the plant altogether.\n\u201cEverything they asked us to do, we did,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cAnd still, we don\u2019t have a product to build.\u201d\nThe UAW concessions to GM included:\nSaving $3 million a year by merging UAW Locals 1112 and 1714 Agreeing to outsource non-assembly jobs to lower-wage workers Agreeing to allow GM to cut the number of skilled jobs at the plant in half Allowing GM to use contractors to repair vehicles at the plant Despite \u201call of these things\u201d being \u201cvery unpopular\u201d with union workers, Morgan told Bloomberg News the UAW agreed to the concessions in July 2017 with the expectation that the new plans would go into effect in January 2018.\nInstead, Morgan said, in November 2018 GM executives announced that the Lordstown plant would be idled, along with GM\u2019s two plants in Michigan and a plant in Maryland.\nLongtime GM worker Sonja Smith, who worked at the Lordstown plant for 24 years, suggested to Bloomberg News the lack of loyalty the corporation has to its employees.\n\u201cWe did everything they want,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThis is their payback.\u201d\nWhile GM lays off thousands of American workers, its production in Mexico and China is ramping up . Specifically, GM is looking to manufacture an electric Cadillac in China and continue manufacturing its Envision compact vehicle in China.\nThe made-in-Mexico Chevrolet Blazer will soon arrive in U.S. markets. Last year, GM became the largest automaker in Mexico, as it has cut jobs in America and increased production to Mexico.\nOffshoring production to Mexico has proven cheaper for GM executives, as American workers earn $30 an hour while Mexican workers earn about $3 an hour, a 90 percent cut to wages that widens the corporation\u2019s profit margins. Barra, for example, continues to rake in about $22 million despite the corporation\u2019s layoffs of thousands of U.S. workers.\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Its final estimate of that growth rate is 5.62 percent compared with 4.59 percent in its February proposal.\n\"Most of the puts-and-takes remained the same as proposed, but CMS upped the growth rate, which is definitely helpful in 2020,\" said Ipsita Smolinski, managing director at healthcare research consulting firm Capitol Street.\nMedicare Advantage plans serve more than 20 million people, most of them aged 65 and older.\nShares in insurers were unchanged in after hours trading. UnitedHealth Group Inc, Humana Inc, CVS Health Corp, through its acquisition of Aetna, and WellCare Health Plans Inc are the largest sellers of Medicare Advantage health insurance.\nUnder the program, they are paid a set rate by the government to cover member healthcare costs.\nIn addition to medical costs, the government's 2020 payment rate also factors in other changes in policies, such as quality of care related payments that may result in declines or increases from year to year.\nFor instance, the 2020 rate reflected a decline in payments of 3.08 percent related to the Affordable Care Act requirement that Medicare Advantage and fee-for-service Medicare have the same payment structure.\nStarting in 2020, Medicare Advantage plans will also be able to offer supplemental non-health related benefits to chronically ill enrollees that address their social needs, CMS Administrator Seema Verma said. Those can include needed structural changes to the home, such as adding ramps and widening doorways.\nThe plans can tailor these offerings to individuals, and the offerings could increase competition between plans, Verma said.\nPreviously, plans have only been allowed to offer health related benefits.\nMedicare Advantage competes with the traditional Medicare fee-for-service program. Both have grown as the \"Baby Boomer\" generation ages into Medicare. Together, they cover more than 55 million people.

Sam McNeil/AP hide caption toggle caption Sam McNeil/AP Liu Yuejin of China's National Narcotics Control Commission speaks at a Beijing press conference on Monday. He announced that all fentanyl-related drugs will become controlled substances, effective May 1. Sam McNeil/AP\nChina has announced that all variants of fentanyl will be treated as controlled substances, after Washington urged Beijing to stop fueling the opioid epidemic in the United States.\nAuthorities in China already regulate 25 variants of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid linked to thousands of drug overdose deaths in the U.S. But some manufacturers in China, seeking to evade controls, have introduced slight changes to the molecular structure of their drugs, giving them the legal loophole to manufacture and export before the government can assess the products for safety and medical use.\nThe decision to regulate all fentanyl-related drugs as controlled substances \"puts a wider array of substances under regulation,\" Liu Yuejin, an official of China's National Narcotics Control Commission, said at a press conference in on Monday. The regulation will take effect May 1. Fentanyl Surpasses Heroin As Drug Most Often Involved In Deadly Overdoses\nBryce Pardo, a drug policy researcher at Rand Corporation, tells NPR that in theory, the regulation \"future-proofs the law\" by including impending chemical modifications.\nBut China may not be able to enforce the new rules, Pardo says. \"[Authorities] already have problems enforcing existing laws.\" He says official reports show the country does not have enough inspectors for facilities, and law enforcement would have to \"take a sample\" from a facility and eventually \"analyze whether it's a fentanyl-related structure.\"\nVanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution who focuses on illegal economies, tells NPR the regulation is \"a good step,\" but whether China \"will have the will and the capacity to do it is a big question.\"\nThe United States and China have been negotiating for better drug control since the Obama era, she adds. In the midst of the trade war with the Trump administration, \"China is looking for one area where it can still continue cooperating with the U.S.,\" Felbab-Brown says.\nThe announcement comes after President Xi Jinping vowed in a December meeting with President Trump to classify fentanyl as a controlled substance . After the meeting, Trump called on China to seek the death penalty for fentanyl distributors.\nLiu denied on Monday accusations that China is a major contributor to the U.S. opioid crisis, saying Chinese law enforcement has \"solved several cases\" of illegal fentanyl-related drug manufacturing and distribution. \"They are all shipped to the U.S. by criminals through evasive means, through international packages,\" Liu said. \"The amount is extremely limited and cannot be the main source of the substance in the U.S.\"\nHe said the U.S. opioid problem was mainly caused by \"domestic reasons,\" according to the South China Morning Post .\nAccording to a 2018 report by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission , China remains \"the largest source of illicit fentanyl and fentanyl-like substances\" in the United States and \"illicit manufacturers create new substances faster than they can be controlled.\"\nChemical exporters in China secretly send drugs to the West through fake shipment labels and other tactics, the report stated. Fentanyl-Linked Deaths: The U.S. Opioid Epidemic's Third Wave Begins\nFentanyl is a synthetic opioid that relieves extreme pain. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It also is the drug most often found in overdose deaths in the United States. In 2016, fentanyl was linked to more than 18,000 drug overdose deaths, 29 percent of drug overdose deaths that year, according to a National Vital Statistics System report.\nFelbab-Brown says China's new stance on fentanyl-related substances stems partially from a desire to be a global enforcer on drugs. \"From a public relations perspective, it's difficult for China to be accused of being a source of drugs,\" she says.\nChina does not have a monopoly on fentanyl production, she adds. \"Even if tomorrow the United States wouldn't get fentanyl from China, others would step in.

That's what Vice Adm. Bill Merz, the deputy chief of naval operations, told a House of Representatives subcommittee on March 27, 2019. \"We\u2019re expecting a pretty hard look at the mix of ships this year,\" Merz said, according to USNI News. The U.S. Navy's New Plan: Lots of Frigates That Can Do a Lot of Damage The U.S. Navy might tweak its force-structure goals in order to boost the number of frigates. That's what Vice Adm. Bill Merz, the deputy chief of naval operations, told a House of Representatives subcommittee on March 27, 2019. \"We\u2019re expecting a pretty hard look at the mix of ships this year,\" Merz said, according to USNI News. In rewriting the force-structure plan to include more small surface combatants, the Navy could signal its intention to acquire larger numbers of smaller ships at the expense of bigger ships. The idea would be to distribute U.S. naval power across a greater number of less-expensive vessels, reversing a decades-long trend toward larger, and fewer U.S. warships. \"We know we are heavy on large surface combatants, and we\u2019d like to adjust that to a more appropriate mix, especially with the lethality we\u2019re seeing coming along with the frigate,\" Merz said. The Navy's released its last force-structure plan in late 2016. That plan , which called for a fleet of 355 major warships, up from the 289 ships the Navy possessed in early 2019. The new, bigger fleet would include 104 large surface combatants such as destroyers and cruisers and 52 small surface combatants including Littoral Combat Ships and frigates. But the Navy is struggling to afford the 355-ship fleet. The 2020 edition of the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan projects the fleet could grow to 355 ships by 2034. But the Congressional Budget Office estimated that just buying all the new vessels would cost $27 billion per year, roughly double what the Navy historically has spent. Reducing the number of large warships and adding frigates could help to reduce the cost of a larger fleet. A 9,000-ton-displacement Arleigh Burke -class destroyer costs more than $2 billion. A frigate, displacing just 5,000 tons, should cost around $1 billion, according to the Navy. But the frigate still could carry many of the same weapons and sensors that a destroyer does, although somewhat fewer of them. According to a Navy document that the Congressional Research Service obtained, the frigate will come armed with a 57-millimeter gun, a 32-cell vertical missile-launcher for SM-2 Block IIIC and Evolved Sea Sparrow missiles, a 21-round point-defense Rolling Airframe Missile launcher and eight launchers for over-the-horizon anti-ship missiles. Its radar and combat system will be a smaller version of the Aegis system that equips the Navy's destroyers and cruisers. The frigate will embark an MH-60R helicopter and an MQ-8C drone. That weapons and sensor suite should give the frigate the ability to engage enemy aircraft, ships and submarines at a distance of 100 miles or more. Over time, the ship could gain additional weaponry. The Navy document refers to potential upgrades for the frigate including a 150-kilowatt laser and an anti-submarine missile, which could be a rocket-boosted torpedo similar in concept to the defunct ASROC missile. But the SM-2 Block IIIC, of which the frigate could carry 32, could be the new ship's most potent weapon. The Block IIIC replaces the semi-active radar-homing seeker on older SM-2s with the active radar-homing seeker of the SM-6 missile. The SM-6's seeker itself is a derivative of the Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile. With a semi-active missile, the launching ship must use its own radar to guide the missile through most of its flight. An active missile has its own, tiny radar, allowing the ship to launch and leave, thus protecting it from retaliatory strikes. The SM-2 Block IIIC can do much more than just shoot down aircraft. With small tweaks to the seeker, the Navy already has given the SM-6 and SM-2 Block IIIC missiles anti-ship capability. Additional tweaks could allow the SM-6 -- and by extension the SM-2 Block IIIC -- to hit targets on land. The new frigate also could function as a command vessel for robotic vessels, using Link 11 and Link 16 data links, satellite communications and Network Tactical Common Data Link to help the unmanned vessels to navigate and also to authorize them to fire weapons.

In El Paso, Texas, U.S. authorities had been holding migrants under a highway bridge behind fencing and barbed wire.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\nWe have some news from El Paso, Texas. Nobody spent last night there in detention under a certain highway bridge. For days, U.S. Customs and Border Protection had been holding migrants behind fencing and barbed wire under that bridge. Officials argued they had no choice. So many families have arrived seeking asylum, there is no room in regular detention centers. Yearly numbers, we should be clear, are still below historic highs. But the numbers have risen dramatically so far in 2019, the numbers of migrants arriving at the border. This is the surge that has President Trump talking of closing the border.\nOur co-host, David Greene, is in El Paso, Texas. David, good morning.\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\nHey there, Steve.\nINSKEEP: What's that bridge look like now?\nGREENE: Well, it looks totally different. I mean, you know, we had been hearing for days now about families with their kids just crammed under that Paso del Norte International Bridge. Some were sleeping on the dirt, in these cold nights, behind barbed wire. By midday yesterday, they were all moved out. They've been relocated.\nOur producer, Danny Hajek, went down and was looking at the area - totally vacant there. You know, he saw garbage just littered on the dirt where families had been sleeping. And you know those blankets made of Mylar that look like foil that, you know, people get after they go on a marathon run? They had been keeping people warm there. And now you just saw these pieces of foil caught up in the metal fencing, just really fluttering in the wind quietly.\nINSKEEP: So people were held under the bridge. The explanation was there was no place else to take them. But now they've been taken somewhere. Where?\nGREENE: I mean, that's the big question. We asked the border authorities to confirm these reports that some of them have been moved to a different holding facility that's really close by, right in the same area there. And they haven't told us anything yet. But they had come under a lot of criticism for the conditions under that bridge.\nAnd I got to say, we got here midday yesterday, and it took just one phone call to find a spot where some of the people who were under that bridge had been taken. It was this motel where a shelter organization had rented out some of the rooms. And I saw a van pull up. A Border Patrol agent unlocked this metal door on the back of the van, was guiding migrants - including little boys and girls - out. We watched maybe a dozen or so arriving at this hotel. And I want to play the voice of Suzanne Tilton (ph). She's one of the volunteers there.\nSUZANNE TILTON: When they tell their stories, it is emotionally draining because you feel helpless, like you really can't do much for them other than just help them get to where they're going. We can feed them. We can make them feel loved and comfortable here and safe here. They're safe. They're fed, and they're warm. And we're going to help them reunite with their families.\nGREENE: And Steve, I mean, just one detail as we were watching these families arrive and seek whatever help they could get - apparently, the border authorities, they take away your shoelaces when you arrive at the border, along with a lot of other - your personal belongings. And I saw this one little boy at the hotel who - he had tied his shoes using strips of that Mylar foil from the blankets. And just to see the relief on his face when they handed him new shoelaces - I mean, it was just really powerful.\nINSKEEP: Although, how long will he and others be at that motel?\nGREENE: Well, I mean, we're told maybe just a night. And - you know, and then a new group will come in, more groups each day. And here's how the system works. I mean, in the past, ICE - Immigration Customs Enforcement - would determine what happens to them. But Border Patrol's been so overwhelmed, there hasn't been any time to involve ICE in some cases. So they would release these families to a shelter organization, like the one we visited. If a family somewhere in the U.S. had sponsored them, buys them travel, they're taken to maybe an airport or bus station, given a court date and released in the United States.\nBut the volunteers we talked to - I mean, they're really worried. The numbers keep going up. Border Patrol might be so overwhelmed, they might not even be able to give them to these shelter organizations. They might just have to release them into the streets, effectively leaving people homeless to fend for themselves in what's really a strange country.\nINSKEEP: David, thanks so much. Really appreciate it.\nGREENE: You bet, Steve.\nINSKEEP: That's our own David Greene. He's in El Paso, Texas. We'll listen for more of his reporting in days to come.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

Here's what acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney had to say about it yesterday on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THIS WEEK\")\nMICK MULVANEY: There's a lot of good ways to help solve this problem. Congress could do it, but they're not going to. Mexico could help us do it; they need to do a little bit more. Honduras could do more. Nicaragua could do more. El Salvador could do more. And if we're going to give these countries hundreds of millions of dollars, we would like them to do more.\nMARTIN: But much of that U.S. foreign aid isn't sent directly to governments; it often funds nonprofits and NGOs trying to deal with some of the issues that are causing people to flee in the first place - nonprofits like Glasswing International. The organization works throughout Central America, including in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, primarily in the fields of education and health. Joining us on the line now is Glasswing's CEO; his name is Ken Baker, and he joins us on the line from Costa Rica. Mr. Baker, thanks for being here.\nKEN BAKER: Thank you, Rachel. Thank you so much for having me.\nMARTIN: Can you explain what kind of difference this decision to cut aid would make to the work that you do?\nBAKER: You know, it's - you know, listening to those stories up - about - in El Paso, and that description is just so difficult to hear. And, you know, we at Glasswing, like many of the nonprofits that work there, that receive funding to support efforts there, are really trying to tackle the problem at the root, at where the problem is. And we believe once you're at the border, once you're talking about policy in the U.S., it's too late; I mean, the problem is down there.\nAnd to have funding cut, essentially, abruptly, potentially - I mean, we're not sure exactly what will happen because, you know, fortunately, both Republicans and Democrats, they're very bipartisan; they do understand the value of foreign aid and especially to this region. But do - you know, a lot of these programs - our continuity, and to - you know, one of the most important rules of development is, you just can't cut, all of a sudden, a program that you have. It takes a while to build up trust and confidence...\nMARTIN: Right.\nBAKER: ...You know, especially for some of our programs.\nMARTIN: So let me ask you - President Trump says essentially that these countries do need to work on root causes, that it should be their mandate. So you're doing the work that the president says he'd like to see more of. But at the same time, does government not have a place? I mean, do you think that the local governments in these countries, the national governments, are doing enough to support you, to support your work, to create countries and societies that people don't want to flee from?\nBAKER: Well, you know, one of the misnomers that is out there is that - you know, on one side of it, sure, these countries could do more and need to do more, and these are major challenges. But the challenges are huge as far as violence goes. But one of the misnomers in migration is that these countries - this is a positive for these countries. And, you know, and one of the things that has been talked about is, how - you know, that they aren't doing enough. But they really do work with us. They do work with the U.S. government. They - it is in their interests.\nOnce someone makes a decision to leave, once an individual, a family, a community member, makes a decision to leave, the problems are exacerbated by five times, in my estimation, because, you know, it's such a difficult decision to make, to go north, and it leaves a brain drain. It leaves a family to - a breakdown in families. It leaves, you know, youth without their parents sometimes. And it creates - you know, it creates individuals that are - have serious debt once they go forward. They have PSTD (ph), they - to try to - you know, one of our objectives...\nMARTIN: Yeah.\nBAKER: ...As well is to reinsert individuals into their communities. And so once they leave, it's - the problems are definitely exacerbated.\nMARTIN: Ken Baker is the CEO of Glasswing; it's a nonprofit that works with communities in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras - the countries being targeted for U.S. foreign aid cut off from President Trump.

Mitch McConnell Own a Cargo Ship that Was Found with 90 Pounds of Cocaine?", "text": "Politics Did U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell Own a Cargo Ship that Was Found with 90 Pounds of Cocaine? A relatively small amount of cocaine was found by the Colombian Navy hidden on a boat belonging to a company owned by Mitch McConnell\u2019s father-in-law. Saturday Claim\nSome 90 pounds of cocaine was found on a cargo ship owned by U.S. Senate Majority Leader and anti-drug politician Mitch McConnell. Rating About this rating Origin\nOn 25 August 2014, the Colombian Navy, in collaboration with the Office of the Attorney General of Colombia (CTI), reported the seizure of roughly 90 pounds (~40 kilograms) of cocaine hidden in the anchor chain storage space of a dry bulk transport boat named the \u201cPing May\u201d ( translated from Spanish):\nUnits of the National Navy \u2026 with personnel of the CTI \u2026 seized 39.8 kilograms of cocaine hydrochloride on board the coal transport vessel \u201cPing May\u201d \u2026 The inspection of the vessel, which was anchored in the Ci\u00e9naga \u2013 Magdalena sector \u2026, found \u2026 40 packages containing the alkaloid, which were located in the chain store. \u2026 The \u201cPing May\u201d coal ship arrived in Colombia six days ago, coming from England and heading to the port of Rotterdam \u2013 Holland.\nNo arrests have been made in this case, and the amount of cocaine seized was fairly low by the standards of international drug trafficking. Joaquin Perez, a criminal defense lawyer in Miami who specializes in international drug-trafficking cases, told the Washington Post Fact Checker in May 2018 that \u201cForty kilos in a big ship with containers and stuff like that is not a significant amount.\u201d He argued that establishing responsibility for the drugs, especially when it was not found in a registered shipping container, would be challenging. \u201cIf it was found in the captain\u2019s room, then you can charge the captain, or in one of the crew members\u2019 rooms,\u201d Perez said. \u201cBut short of that, I don\u2019t know how you can charge anything.\u201d\nLater, in October 2014, The Nation published a story , \u201cMitch McConnell\u2019s Freighted Ties to a Shadowy Shipping Company\u201d, linking the Ping May with a company that was at the time owned and operated by Mitch McConnell\u2019s father in law, James Chao:\nThe Republican Senate minority leader has the closest of ties to the owner of the Ping May, the vessel containing the illicit materials: the Foremost Maritime Corporation, a firm founded and owned by McConnell\u2019s in-laws, the Chao family. \u2026 Like many international shipping companies, Chao\u2019s firm is shrouded from public view, concealing its identity and limiting its legal liability through an array of tax shelters and foreign registrations. Registered through a limited liability company in the Marshall Islands, the Ping May flies the Liberian flag.\nAccording to United States Coast Guard records and maritime tracking services, the Ping May was then and is still now a Liberian registered cargo ship owned by a shell company (Ping May LLC) controlled by the Foremost group, which is now run by James\u2019 daughter Angela Chao , whose sister is Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\nThe issue of the Ping May was raised again in 2018 as part of a widely debunked primary campaign ad against McConnell from wealthy coal magnate Don Blankenship that inexplicably (at the time) labeled the senator \u201cCocaine Mitch.\u201d Later, by way of an explanation, Blankenship made the claim in a press release that:\nMitch McConnell and his family have extensive ties to China. His father-in-law who founded and owns a large Chinese shipping company has given Mitch and his wife millions of dollars over the years.\nThe company was implicated recently in smuggling cocaine from Colombia to Europe, hidden aboard a company ship carrying foreign coal was $7 million dollars of cocaine and that is why we\u2019ve deemed him \u201cCocaine Mitch.\u201d\nThe Foremost Group is not a Chinese Company \u2014 it is an American company founded in New York in 1964 and which is run by Americans of Chinese descent who immigrated to the United States in the 60s. Seven million dollars for 90 pounds of cocaine, as well, appears to be, at best, an overestimate of the value of the smuggled contraband, according to the Washington Post . Nevertheless, an even more factually divorced version of this claim eventually evolved into a meme that suggests that Mitch McConnell \u2014 not Foremost \u2014 owned the boat:\nAs we have explained, Mitch McConnell\u2019s only connection to this incident is the fact that his wife\u2019s family (but neither Mitch McConnell nor Elaine Chao specifically) own and operate a shipping company that contracts out a Liberian-registered dry bulk cargo boat for the transport of coal that someone, in 2014, attempted (and failed) to hide cocaine in. No evidence has ever come to light that suggests Foremost was legally liable for the cocaine incident, and Mitch McConnell, as a matter of simple fact, does not own the Ping May. As such, we rank the claim false.

The Red Chamber\nThe group lamented that the APC has continued to deny the Southeast a fair share even when the zone recorded a massive support by electing more senators and members of the House of Representatives than it did in 2015.\nIt urged President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC national chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole to ensure that the party does not deny any zone its due in the sharing of national positions.\nIn a statement signed by its President, Chief Goodluck Egwu Ibem; Secretary, Dr. Igwe Kanice and Publicity Secretary, Hon. Joshua Nnamani, the group vowed that Ndigbo would no longer allow itself to be relegated to the background.\n\u201cLooking at the manner in which the APC has been sharing its position, we make bold to say that the party has been too parochial. It has failed to act as a true national party. The APC has been unfair to Ndigbo. In 2015, the APC said we didn\u2019t elect a senator who could have been made senate president. Now, in 2019, the APC recorded victories in the South East .\n\u201cInstead of zoning the senate presidency position to the South East and anointing one of the ranking senators, the APC is again giving reasons.\n\u201cHow can the APC zone the senate presidency to the North West where it adopted Senator Ahmed Lawan, leaving out the Igbo which is one of the major tripods on which the Nigerian federation stands?

Dan?\nDan Gladney\nThanks Scott. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. It\u2019s been a very busy last few months for us at ReShape Lifesciences as we continue to horn in and optimize our strategy to become a leading provider of solutions for obesity and metabolic diseases.\nAnd this last quarter as certainly one filled with hard work and change, culminating in the acquisition of Apollo\u2019s LAP-BAND product line in exchange for the sale of the ReShape Balloon business to Apollo Endosurgery.\nAlthough, we did discuss in detail a transaction of Apollo, when that deal was announced, I would like to take some time today to reiterate the rationale and then give you some additional information regarding integration and our strategic plan as we move forward.\nAs many of you know, LAP-BAND is a very well known, minimally invasive weight loss technology with over 20 years of commercial success and proven clinical efficacy. We were thrilled when we were made aware of the opportunity to bring this asset into ReShape Lifesciences.\nLAP-BAND is both FDA approved and reimbursed by most private payers in the United States, and in fact, the LAP-BAND is the only weight loss implant technology that is currently reimbursed in the U.S.\nThe acquisition of LAP-BAND has given us an approved reimbursed well known product to offer now for patients in the Body Mass Index of 30 and above and also provide us a distribution system outside the U.S. that is already in place. This will not only allow us to hit the ground running with LAP-BAND internationally, but will also save us both time and money once our next-generation ReShape Vest is approved. We really believe that the product is a perfect addition to our portfolio.\nLAP-BAND has a track record that has brought immediate significant revenue and gross margin to ReShape Lifesciences with very little required investment. As you are aware, much of last year was challenging for ReShape as our cash needs outweighed our ability to finance the company, putting us in a difficult operational position.\nThe addition of the revenue and margin from LAP-BAND could not have come in a better time for the Briatric surge in customer base that is synergistic to the core call point for ReShape since our inception. We are confident in our ability to successfully sell the LAP-BAND, and in fact, have already seen immediate results since the acquisition of the product late last year.\nTouching quickly on our decision to divest the ReShape Balloon. Unfortunately the growth of the ReShape Balloon was not what it was projected to be at the time we acquired the business in October of 2017. This unanticipated underperformance of the Balloon business was primarily due to an FDA letter related to the risk of inter-gastric balloons which hit the business harder than expected.\nIn addition, the cash required to run the ReShape Balloon product line was significantly higher than projected at the time of acquisition. Together, these factors hinder both our ability to generate significant revenue and as a result our ability to further capitalized the company and grow in a way that was consistent with our corporate vision.\nWe therefore made the decision to divest the ReShape Balloon and to cut our losses allowing us to refocus our financial and operational resources on the future and on the ReShape Vest, which we believe is the next big step for bariatric surgery.\nTurning to the integration of the LAP-BAND, we have really hit the ground running in the United States. As you remember, when we acquired the LAP-BAND, the sales trend was on a decline as Apollo was allocated and virtually no resources to the product, and we shared that our goal initially would be to reduce the sales decline.\nWe have increased the number of reps selling the LAP-BAND from two professional that were selling with Apollo to five full-time sales reps in United States, as well as a full-time sales trainer and we already incredibly -- and we're already incredibly excited and proud of the effort from our sales team. In fact, we've already seen a reduction and the sales declined thus far in quarter one.\nOur strategy and approach in addition to reaching new accounts is to stratify the top customers who represent a significant part of the business and to increase the number of LAP-BAND procedures for these accounts. We want to spend more time to field these existing customers who only do a few procedures a year and to help them understand the benefits of doing more procedures. Our reps are really focusing on education and patient follow-up to reinforce the efficacy and success LAP-BAND procedure. We are also working in partnership with some existing accounts and utilizing co-ops spending programs to help drive business.\nNow outside the United States we are working hard to build an infrastructure, which until now that existed for ReShape Lifesciences. OUS markets account for approximately 40% of existing LAP-BAND sales, with Australia being the number one international market for us. As part of the transaction and the transition Apollo has continued to sell the LAP-BAND outside the U.S. in order to give us time to set up our infrastructure.\nOur plan internationally is to focus first on Australia where our goal is to hire two sales professionals and then on to Europe where we are planning to add a third and fourth, excuse me, a three to five person team, all of whom will be supported by distributors in key markets.\nWe are on target to have our infrastructure set up in Australia by the end of April and by the end of second quarter in Europe, at which point we will be a position to realize revenue in those geographies.\nWe are thrilled that this acquisition of LAP-BAND also provides us with the technology that is a perfect precursor to our ReShape Vest, both products wrap around the stomach, they are sold to the same call point the bariatric surgeon and are both incredibly exciting technologies that we believe our best-in-class for weight loss.\nWe also believe that ReShape Vest is the next big step for bariatric surgeon following on the heels of LAP-BAND. Additionally, divesting the ReShape Balloon and acquiring the LAP-BAND provides us with the financial flexibility to further develop the Vest.\nTurning now to the ReShape Vest. We've made great progress in the past few months. In February we held the live surgery training course and investigator meeting in Prague for bariatric surgeons and key opinion leaders who are serving as investigators in the company's ENDURE II trial in the European Union. This training generated our continued excitement about the ReShape Vest.\nAs a reminder, the ReShape Lifesciences ENDURE II trial is an investigative prospective nonrandomized multicenter study to assess the safety and effectiveness of the ReShape Vest for treatment of obese patients. The trial will include up to 95 subjects at eight to 10 investigational sites located in Spain, the Czech Republic, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nOur most exciting news in the Vest is that Dr. Jordi Pujol, our principal investigator in Barcelona, Spain, successfully implanted the first patient in our ENDURE II trial last week. The patient was discharged from the hospital at the expected time and continues to do well.\nOne year data from enrolled subjects will be used to support the CE Marking application for the Vest and we will continue to follow patient outcomes for up to two years. We estimate receiving CE approval in quarter four of 2021.\nTurning to our financial performance, while we ended the third quarter with a healthy amount of cash on the balance sheet, we did spend significantly in the last fourth quarter on the LAP-BAND acquisition and at subsequent integration, which has included building, the OUS infrastructure and adding an entirely new ERP system. Those investment dollars are already showing their benefits in the form of LAP-BAND revenue and margin. We truly believe in this product and its value to ReShape, our customers and our investors.\nIn order to bridge our balance sheet as we wait for a positive financial impact of LAP-BAND sales, we will continue to do some small financings, last Friday, March 29th we announced that the company had entered into a definitive agreement with certain institutional investors for a $2 million convertible note financing. The details of which Scott will share with you later.\nUltimately, once the company shore up its cash position and has a bit more experience traction with LAP-BAND the plan will be to have discussions to relist ReShape Lifesciences stock back on NASDAQ.\nIt is with mixed emotions that I made the decision to retire from being a public company CEO and announced my retirement as the CEO of ReShape Lifesciences. It has been a wonderful experience with the business and a -- that I was so fortunate to work with. I truly believe in the mission and the vision of ReShape.\nI worked closely with the Board that handpicked Bart as my replacement and I believe he is the perfect fit. I thank everyone for the opportunity to be CEO and lead such a wonderful team and I'm thrilled to be able to stay involve as the Chairman of the Board.\nI am now turning the call back over to Scott Youngstrom, our CFO, who will walk you through our financial results. Scott?\nScott Youngstrom\nThanks, Dan. Let me highlight a few activities that occurred over the last quarter of 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2018 the company's Board of Directors and stockholders approved a 1-for-140 reverse split of the company's outstanding common stock that became effective after the close of market on November 7, 2018. [Inaudible] and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock splits for all periods presented.\nOn November 25, 2018, the company raised $10 million through a registered direct offering, which supplemented the $16 million that was raised through the company's aftermarket stock offering programs throughout October and November of 2018. These capital raises enabled the company to move forward with a significant and strategic business.\nOn December 17, 2018, the company acquired Apollo Endosurgery -- acquired from Apollo Endosurgery substantially all of the assets exclusively related to Apollo's LAP-BAND product line and Apollo acquired from ReShape substantially all of the assets exclusively related to our ReShape Balloon product line.\nAs part of the agreement we were also required to pay Apollo a cash consideration of $17 million of which $10 million was paid at the closing of the transaction, $2 million is payable on each of the first and second anniversaries of the transaction, and $3 million is payable on the third anniversary of the closing date.\nAdditionally, as a part of the transition services agreement, Apollo will manufacture the LAP-BAND on our behalf for up to two years, served as our distributor of the LAP-BAND product outside of the U.S. for up to one year and provide other specified services.\nAs Dan mentioned earlier, last week on March 29th we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement with certain institutional investors for a $2 million convertible note financing, which will be in the form of a private placement. In connection with the financing we will also amend the exercise price of warrants to purchase up to 8 million shares of common stock held by the investors that were issued on November 25, 2018, from $1.50 per share to a penny per share.\nMoving on to the financial results for 2018, when you review our financial statements and related footnotes in our 10-K, you will notice significant changes in our presentation due to the reporting requirement surrounding our acquisition of the LAP-BAND product line. You will notice a line called loss from discontinued operations net of tax that removes the effects of our Balloon business, which we sold as part of the Apollo transaction. Our 2018 and ongoing financial analysis will focus on our performance for our continuing operations.\nFor example, our revenue for the year ended 2018 totaled $2.8 million. However, we are reporting $607,000 as this is comprised of $450,000 of LAP-BAND revenue for the 14-day period from December 18th to December 31st plus $156,000 of revenue generated in 2018 by the vBloc product line.\nIn comparison, we reported $1.3 million of total revenue 2017. However, in our continuing operations, we will show -- only show $569,000 for the year ended 2017, which is comprised of $319,000 of vBloc revenue and $250,000 of service revenue. No activity associated with the Balloon product is reflected in our ongoing financial statements. However, details of our Balloon business can be found in the footnotes to our financial statements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we reported ongoing revenues of $607,000 and gross profit totaling $442,000, a gross margin percentage of 73%. For the year ended December 31, 2017, ongoing revenues were $569,000 and gross profit totaled $236,000, a gross margin percentage of 41%.\nThe significant increase in gross margin in 2018 was driven by the higher margin LAP-BAND product line as compared to the lower vBloc and service revenue margins generated in the comparable prior period.\nThe company anticipates gross margins will remain in the 70% to 75% range throughout 2019. This is a significant improvement over the 25%, 3% and 13% gross margins reported by the company our previous three quarters of 2018, respectively, which primarily reflected the previously discussed low margins associated with the product Balloon line.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2018, the company reported revenues from continuing operations for the LAP-BAND product of $450,000 and associated gross profit of $372,000. There were no corresponding revenues from continuing operations for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018, totaled $16.3 million, as compared to $22.8 million in 2017. This decrease is primarily due to the reduction in headcount as compared to the prior year and lower overall expenditures as a part of our integration strategy.\nIncluded in SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018, were stock-based compensation and warrant expense of $2.9 million, inventory write-offs for obsolete product of $2 million, legal fees related to patent infringement defense and transactional fees of $2 million and severance of $569,000.\nIncluded in SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, in addition to the expenses picked up with the BarioSurg acquisition included a non-cash charge of $8.7 million related to stock compensation and warrants expense.\nPrior year SG&A also included $1.2 million of expenses related to our acquisition, $1.1 million associated with severance and one-time charges, and $720,000 of amortization expense, a total of $3 million.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, were $4.3 million, as compared to $6.4 million for the third quarter 2018. The company feels that the current quarterly run rate of approximately $4.5 million is indicative of the SG&A expenses to be incurred throughout 2019.\nResearch and development expenses for 2018 totaled $5.4 million, as compared to a similar amount of $5.4 million for 2017. This is primarily due to the development of the gastric vest and the vBloc block and stem research throughout both 2018 and 2017. For 2019, our primary R&D investments will be on the ReShape Vest product line as minimal R&D will be required for the LAP-BAND product line.\nWe continue to review our organization including our cost structure in an effort to best align revenues and costs. As part of the integration and cost control efforts, we have reduced our overall employee count from a combined 97 ReShape medical and EnteroMedics employees at the beginning of 2018 to a total of 36 ReShape Lifesciences employees at present.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $5.5 million and the company's debt was the $7 million asset purchase consideration payable to Apollo for the LAP-BAND product line. We are targeting our net monthly burn in 2019 to be no more than $800,000 per month.\nLastly with the earlier discussed acquisition of LAP-BAND, expansion in our sales force and our reach into the OUS markets and with the recently announced addition of our new CEO with previous LAP-BAND experience, we want to reiterate that our strategy is one of controlled expansion as we grow into our new markets while at the same time preserving cash to support the clinical programs around our ReShape Vest.\nWe feel that we will be better able to give revenue guidance after experiencing a few more quarters of activity. We have a goal to turn the U.S. revenue decline around and optimize the OUS markets by revitalizing previous customers.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Bart Bandy, our new President and CEO. Bart is a seasoned leader in the medical technology space with almost three decades of experience, a third of which time was spent building the LAP-BAND market and awareness for both Inamed and Allergan. What a perfect fit for Bart to bring his experience and vast network within bariatrics as he helps us build the future of ReShape. We could not be more excited for Bart to join the team. Bart, we welcome you to ReShape.\nBart Bandy\nThanks, Scott. I could not be more pleased to be at ReShape Lifesciences. As Scott mentioned, I have spent over the past 25 years in various operational and commercial leadership roles with a significant portion of that time dedicated to this obesity space. Given my experience in building and growing organizations\u2019 product and sales in healthcare and bariatric surgery specifically, this is a great fit for me.\nIt was a tremendous pleasure to oversee the growth of the LAP-BAND technology during my years at Inamed and then Allergan, and I am truly excited to be reunited with this technology and to bring my experiences to ReShape.\nI see a unique opportunity in ReShape and that there is still is a treatment gap that has not been filled for most obese patients. The technology is there but the market awareness and penetration has never been realized. ReShape has the solutions, both with the LAP-BAND and with the exciting ReShape Vest that is currently enrolling patients for the CE Mark study in Europe. Our product portfolio has an exceptional opportunity to drive sustainable growth in a global market.\nTurning to my vision for ReShape Lifesciences, the technologies at ReShape truly change people's lives, both physically and emotionally. That is what gets me excited. We will work with the KOLs and the physician community to build a robust technology roadmap that thinks ahead into the future, establishes deep awareness of the clinical evidence to support the benefits of our technologies from both an outcomes and a cost perspective, and build a best-in-class team dedicated to enhance professional and patient education from surgical discernment and practice through post-procedural follow-up.\nWorking together with the committed community of medical professional we can enhance patient outcomes and improve the lives of many people battling obesity and metabolic disease. I look forward to spending more time with all of our stakeholders over the coming months and providing updates on our strategies and progress. Thank you for everyone to come out today.\nQ -\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude your program and you may all disconnect.

We have the fourth pick in this draft and we\u2019re going to make sure we get it right.\u201d\nThe Raiders also hold the Nos. 24 and 27 picks, as well as the No. 35 pick (second round), so they have wiggle room to trade up for a quarterback if they desire.\nThe NFL draft will be held April 25-27 in Nashville, Tenn.\n\u2013Field Level Media DE Ogbah a no-show at Browns workouts\nCleveland DE Ogbah a no-show at Browns workouts\nCleveland Browns defensive end Emmanuel Ogbah did not report to the team\u2019s offseason program Monday because he expects to be traded, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter reported.\nOgbah, selected by the Browns in the second round (32nd overall) of the 2016 NFL Draft, reportedly has been on the trading block since the team acquired edge rusher Olivier Vernon from the New York Giants in March.\nOne notable player who did show up for the first day of the voluntary workouts was receiver Odell Beckham Jr., acquired in another trade with the Giants.

Beckham tops the list at $18 million per year.\n\u201cMe, personally, I don\u2019t really care about as far as being the highest-paid receiver, man,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s a number. We\u2019ve got some other guys on the team. If we can do it in a way to get all the other guys to stay on the team \u2026 it\u2019s a lot of ways you can do money.\u201d\nJones has posted five straight seasons with at least 80 catches and 1,400 receiving yards.

Molinari then closed out the third-place match by parring the 16th.\nEarlier in the day both Kisner and Kuchar survived tight battles in the semifinals to advance to the championship match. Kisner defeated Molinari 1-up in the first semifinal while Kuchar outlasted Bjerregaard, also 1-up, in the second final-four dustup.\nAfter competing under mostly warm and benign conditions for the three days of pool play and then in wind and drizzle on Saturday for the Round of 16 and quarterfinals on Saturday, the four golfers remaining in the field for the semifinals teed off with chilly temperatures in the low 40s on Sunday morning.\nMolinari birdied the 16th and 17th holes to catch Kisner, who won it with a par at 18 when Molinari three-putted from 27 feet.\nKuchar never trailed in his match but also never led by more than 1-up against Bjerregaard, who beat on their final hole to advance to the semifinals.\n\u2013Field Level Media", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "burnett", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emmanuel ogbah", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pittsburgh steelers", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "burnett steelers", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "steelers", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "green bay packers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "browns", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morgan burnett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "field level media browns", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleveland browns", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ogbah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pittsburgh", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T03:11:34.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8fe1eb126223b152d46df4d3e81a27700486ee5b", "url": "https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Iran-says-US-sanctions-have-helped-slow-flood-aid-585484", "site_full": "www.jpost.com", "site": "jpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.jpost.com/Rss/RssFeedsFrontPage.aspx", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "JPost.com - Homepage", "title": "Iran FM Zarif: U.S. sanctions slow flood aid, 'economic terrorism'", "title_full": "Iran FM Zarif: U.S. sanctions slow flood aid, 'economic terrorism'", "published": "2019-04-02T00:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_Article2016_ControlFaceDetect/438003", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7307, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 60, "comments": 10, "shares": 40}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8fe1eb126223b152d46df4d3e81a27700486ee5b", "url": "https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Iran-says-US-sanctions-have-helped-slow-flood-aid-585484", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "REUTERS", "published": "2019-04-02T00:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Iran FM Zarif: U.S. sanctions slow flood aid, 'economic terrorism'", "text": "Middle East Iran FM Zarif: U.S. sanctions slow flood aid, 'economic terrorism' Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a tweet that US sanctions were \"impeding aid efforts by #IranianRedCrescent to all communities devastated by unprecedented floods.\" By REUTERS 1 minute read. b An aerial view of flooding in Golestan province, Iran March 27, 2019.

The aircraft is built by Lockheed Martin Corp. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the next shipment of training equipment, and all subsequent shipments of F-35 related material, have been canceled.Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has refused to back down from Ankara's planned purchase of a Russian S-400 missile defense system that the United States has said would compromise the security of F-35 aircraft. Turkey has said it will take delivery of the S-400s in July.The disagreement over the F-35 is the latest of a series of diplomatic disputes between the United States and Turkey including Turkish demands that the United States extradite Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, differences over Middle East policy and the war in Syria, and sanctions on Iran.A Pentagon official had told Reuters in March that the United States had a number of items it could withhold in order to send Turkey a signal that the United States was serious about Ankara dropping its ambition to own the S-400.The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Turkish officials in Ankara were not immediately available for comment.The U.S. decision on the F-35s was expected to complicate Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu's planned visit to Washington this week for a NATO summit. The latest development in the F-35 dispute came a day after Erdogan suffered one of his biggest electoral losses in decades in local elections.Reuters reported last week that Washington was exploring whether it could remove Turkey from production of the F-35. Turkey makes parts of the fuselage, landing gear and cockpit displays. Sources familiar with the F-35's intricate worldwide production process and U.S. thinking on the issue last week said Turkey's role can be replaced.The United States and other NATO allies that own F-35s fear the radar on the Russian S-400 missile system will learn how to spot and track the jet, making it less able to evade Russian weapons in the future.In an attempt to persuade Turkey to drop its plans to buy the S-400, the United States offered the pricier American-made Patriot anti-missile system in a discounted deal that expired at the end of March. Turkey has shown interest in the Patriot system, but not at the expense of abandoning the S-400.Turkey has engaged with U.S. negotiators in recent days about buying the Patriot system, a person familiar with the matter said. The system is made by Raytheon Co.Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar in March said that despite some issues, Turkish pilots were continuing their training at an air base in Arizona on the F-35, each of which costs $90 million, and that Ankara was expecting the aircraft to arrive in Turkey in November.U.S. lawmakers also have expressed alarm over Turkey's planned purchase of the Russian system. Four U.S. senators last week introduced a bipartisan bill that would prohibit the transfer of F-35s to Turkey until the U.S. government certifies that Ankara will not take delivery of the S-400 system.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "erdoga", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "air force", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hatzerim air base", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T03:15:01.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3d0561d54fde02077d0fe78823f0ac0383ece1a8", "url": "https://www.jpost.com/International/Mexican-president-wants-to-bring-order-to-illegal-migration-to-US-585458", "site_full": "www.jpost.com", "site": "jpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.jpost.com/Rss/RssFeedsFrontPage.aspx", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "JPost.com - Homepage", "title": "Mexican president wants to 'bring order' to illegal migration to U.S.", "title_full": "Mexican president wants to 'bring order' to illegal migration to U.S.", "published": "2019-04-01T20:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_Article2016_ControlFaceDetect/433054", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7307, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3d0561d54fde02077d0fe78823f0ac0383ece1a8", "url": "https://www.jpost.com/International/Mexican-president-wants-to-bring-order-to-illegal-migration-to-US-585458", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "REUTERS", "published": "2019-04-01T20:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Mexican president wants to 'bring order' to illegal migration to U.S.", "text": "World News Mexican president wants to 'bring order' to illegal migration to U.S. Most of the people caught at the frontier trying to enter the United States illegally come from three violent and impoverished countries: Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.

(photo credit: CARLOS GARCIA RAWLINS/ REUTERS) UPGRADE YOUR JPOST EXPERIENCE FOR 5$ PER MONTH Show me later\nMEXICO CITY - Mexico will help to regulate the flow of Central American migrants passing through its territory to the United States, but the root causes behind the phenomenon must be tackled, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday.Speaking after U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to close the U.S. southern border if Mexico did not halt illegal immigration immediately, Lopez Obrador said he would not have a confrontation with the United States. \"I prefer love and peace,\" Lopez Obrador told reporters at his regular morning news conference.The leftist president has consistently refused to get drawn into a war of words with Trump over the border.Most of the people caught at the frontier trying to enter the United States illegally come from three violent and impoverished countries: Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.Lopez Obrador has tried to persuade Trump to address the problem by fostering economic development in Central America. But on Saturday the U.S. State Department said it was cutting off aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.Mexico began issuing temporary humanitarian visas to some members of a migrant caravan in southern Mexico, giving priority to children and the elderly, the National Migration Institute said Monday. It said it would provide transport back to Central American countries, Cuba and Haiti, on a voluntary basis.Earlier this year, Mexico handed out humanitarian visas liberally, but reined in the program after a surge in applications. The institute said from next month it was planning to encourage people to apply for visas in their home countries.It was not immediately clear if the government was limiting the number of visas it issues.Detentions at the U.S. border have surged in recent months, angering Trump and putting pressure on Lopez Obrador to find a solution that will prevent a shutdown of the frontier to the market for 80 percent of Mexico's exports.Asked if it was time to put pressure on the Central American countries to do more to tackle the problem, Lopez Obrador said the causes of migration were \"not being attended to\" and that people needed to be offered more opportunities there.\"Obviously, we have to help because Central American migrants pass through our territory and we have to bring order to this migration, make sure it's legal,\" Lopez Obrador said.\"That's what we're doing. But serenely, calmly, without a commotion and with great prudence and responsibility.\"U.S. Border Patrol projections are for over 90,000 apprehensions at the border during March, according to data provided to the Mexican government - a more than 140 percent increase from March 2018, and a seven-fold jump from 2017.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States was working with the Central American governments and Mexico to \"solve this problem at the border,\" and pointed to the numbers when asked why Trump had toughened his stance.\"Just look at the math,\" Pompeo told reporters outside the U.S. Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. \"How many folks are coming across. This is a crisis. We need to fix it.\"\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andres manuel lopez obrador", "sentiment": "none"},

affirms recall of 181 sacked personnel of NSCDC", "text": "The Supreme Court has affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeal, Abuja that recalled 181 sacked personnel of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC).\nDelivering judgment on Monday, the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Tanko Mahammad struck out the appeal filed by the corps challenging the decision of the lower court.\nADVERTISEMENT The acting CJN, who led four other justices, held that the apex court lacked that jurisdiction to entertain the matter.\nHe said that Section 248 (4) of the 1999 Constitution as amended placed all legal disputes which emanated from the National Industrial Court (NIC) to terminate at the court of appeal.\nADVERTISEMENT Mahammad further said that that apex court was therefore not vested with the jurisdiction to entertain such appeals.\n\u201cIn the circumstance, the appellant applicant has reached its limit and the appeal is therefore struck out.\n\u201cThe matter has come to its finality\u2019\u2019, he said.\nThe lost appeal was filed by NSCDC against the judgment by the National Industrial Court (NIC), reinstating 182 of its personnel who were wrongly dismissed.\nNIC had, in a judgment on March 19, 2015, ordered the NSCDC to reinstate the sacked staff with their full emoluments from the time they were illegally dismissed.\nThe trial court also ordered NSCDC to return the employment letters to the affected personnel and pay all arrears of their salaries amounting to about N1.2 billion.\nThe court restrained the NSCDC from further tampering with the employment of the affected personnel.\nDissatisfied with the judgment, the NSCDC, and Immigration and Prisons Service Board (who were respondents at the NIC) appealed the judgment, but failed to diligently prosecute it.\nA three-man panel of the Court of Appeal, led by Justice Moore Adumein, in a ruling, on July 18, 2016, upheld the respondents\u2019 request and dismissed the appeal for lack of diligent prosecution.\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that Obono Musa and 180 others had sued the then Commandant-General, NSCDC, alleging unlawful termination of their employments.\nThey prayed the court to declare that the verbal and oral suspension of the claimants by the NSCDC was null, void and of no effect.\nThe claimants also sought an order directing the defendants to recall all the claimants to work and to also release the original copies of their letters of employment to them.\nThey also asked for an order of the court directing the defendants to immediately pay them all arrears of salaries from 2007 till date.\nSpeaking to newsmen after the court session, Mr Ibrahim Bawa, Counsel to the respondents expressed delight on the outcome of the case, adding that his clients had been exposed to hardship since 2007 when they were unlawfully sacked.\nHe therefore urged President Muhammadu Buhari to impress it on the Commandant-General of the corps to without delay effect the decision of the apex court.\nBawa also said that the president might contemplate investigating the untidy manner the establishment was managed.\nNAN further reports that the 181 personnel of the corps were seen dancing and thanking God for their legal victory in the premises of the court.

For the full year, adjusted earnings per share soared 34% to $5.60. While much of the increase was driven by a lower tax rate, Kohl's also made progress on initiatives to grow its sales and improve its profit margin last year. Kohl's recently filed its annual report for fiscal 2018, which provides more detail on the company's results for the past year and its plans for 2019. Here are three important details investors might have missed. Gross margin growth -- despite pivot to national brands In recent years, Kohl's has been reducing its inventory steadily in order to avoid margin-killing clearance markdowns. This effort is working, as gross margin reached 36.4% in fiscal 2018, up from 36% a year earlier and 35.9% in fiscal 2016. This gross margin improvement is particularly notable because it comes in the face of two major headwinds. First, Kohl's is posting steady double-digit growth in digital sales, and gross margin tends to be lower for e-commerce transactions due to shipping costs. Second, gross margin tends to be lower for national brands than for private-label brands, and Kohl's has been making a big push to grow its sales of national brands recently. A key deal to begin selling Under Armour gear went into effect two years ago. As a result, Kohl's derived 61% of its sales from national brands last year, up from 54% in fiscal 2016. Yet Kohl's was able to more than offset the impact of this shift in its merchandise mix and continue expanding its gross margin. The exterior of a Kohl's store More Kohl's has expanded its gross margin for two consecutive years. Image source: Kohl's. Kohl's plans to continue its focus on growing sales of national brands in 2019. That will include the launch of the Nine West brand at Kohl's this summer. Nevertheless, management expects gross margin to increase slightly once again this year. Free cash flow soared last year, but it may dip in fiscal 2019 One of the most impressive aspects of Kohl's financial performance last year was its cash-flow production. Free cash flow surged 59% year over year to $1.4 billion: the company's highest full-year total in nearly a decade. Working capital gains and a decline in capex to $578 million -- compared to $768 million just two years earlier -- contributed to this strong result. Looking ahead to fiscal 2019, free cash flow is likely to recede again, due to higher planned capital spending. Kohl's expects capex to jump to around $850 million this year, mainly thanks to costs associated with building its sixth e-commerce fulfillment center. Omnichannel capex will nearly triple year over year to $280 million. Kohl's is also planning a substantial year-over-year increase in capex for its \"store strategies\" in fiscal 2019: from $152 million to $240 million. This increase likely relates to the decision to open four more small-format stores this year and an ongoing initiative to subdivide several stores in order to lease excess space to other retail tenants, including Aldi and Planet Fitness . However, capex is likely to moderate in fiscal 2020, driving a rebound in free cash flow. First, e-commerce fulfillment center spending tends to be heavily concentrated in certain years, depending on the timing of construction. Second, technology capex is likely to decline over time, as Kohl's is shifting spending toward cloud services, which have a pay-as-you-go business model. The balance sheet is in excellent shape Kohl's annual report also confirmed that the company's balance sheet is in better shape than it has been since at least 2011. That's because Kohl's used a substantial proportion of its free cash flow last year to pay down debt . By the end of fiscal 2018, Kohl's had $3.5 billion of debt and capital leases on its balance sheet, down from $4.5 billion at the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, the company posted a modest increase in its adjusted earnings last year. This enabled it to reduce its leverage ratio -- adjusted debt divided by adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and rent -- from 2.54 to 2.16. Kohl's current leverage ratio puts it well within investment-grade territory. That means it will be able to return more of its free cash flow to shareholders in the future. Indeed, Kohl's raised its dividend by 10% this year. It also expects to buy back more stock, even though free cash flow will probably be lower in fiscal 2019 than it was last year. And with free cash flow likely to rebound after this year, Kohl's shareholders could benefit from even higher capital returns in fiscal 2020 and beyond.

Blue / Bloomberg via Getty Images file April 1, 2019, 10:16 PM GMT By Suzanne Gamboa and Carmen Sesin In the western highlands of Guatemala, farmers helped by U.S. aid are growing snow peas in soil changed by volcanic ash and learning to use software to help bring their crop to market. The young Mercy Corps program is possible because of the money the United States has been sending into the Northern Triangle, said Dafna Rand, the corps\u2019 vice president of policy and research. It\u2019s also some of the sort of aid that could be on the chopping block as the Trump administration tries another way to control immigration at the border. On Saturday, the administration said it plans to cut off what has been around $700 million a year in aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Experts said the administration is essentially throwing the baby out with the bathwater if it ends financial assistance to the Northern Triangle, as the three countries are known. The money was part of a $2.6 billion package Congress created after the 2014 surge in children from the three countries arriving at the U.S. border. The money helps pay for programs to curb violence, promote economic development and improve security. Related Trump administration says it will cut foreign aid for Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador \u201cWe are very disappointed in this decision and believe it is counterproductive to our mutual goals with the administration to address the root causes of the migration,\u201d Rand said. Rand said it\u2019s too early to tell how successful the snow pea planting program could be in stemming the exodus of people from Central America. But she said there was a 30 percent drop in the number of farmers who said they were considering emigrating when they were surveyed after two years of the program. Much of the aid goes directly to nongovernmental organizations, such as Mercy Corps, and local nonprofits to run programs aimed at curbing violence, job training, keeping young people out of gangs, reducing poverty and many other development areas. Some money is used for training police officers in security but also basics, such as collecting evidence. \"When they cut off this money, I'm concerned that it is going to have the reverse effect, leading to deterioration of the country, stopping great programs and leaving people with fewer options except to come to the U.S.,\" said Jason Marczak, director of the Atlantic Council's Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center. \"By cutting $700 million, you are not punishing the governments, you are punishing the people who are beneficiaries of these programs, a large chunk of whom don't want to come to the U.S.,\" he said. Fernando Cutz, former acting senior director for Western Hemisphere Affairs at the National Security Council under the Trump administration, said he and other advisers had told President Donald Trump early on that \u201cit would be counterproductive to cut all aid to Central America, and will not in any way better the situation of migrants who are fleeing their countries because of violence, because of corruption.\u201d Cutz said even though some people argue that direct aid to the governments should be cut because of corruption or because they are not trustworthy, in this case, the majority of money is given to the nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations that are helping fight corruption in the country or collaborating with the U.S. on security, countering drugs, violence and gangs. \u201cTo cut all programs .... there is no real policy objective that\u2019s going to be met through that. All our policy objectives would likely be harmed by that.\u201d Daniella Burgi-Palomino, a senior associate with the Latin America Working Group, said her group has called for withdrawal of funds from security forces that are abusing human rights and urging the U.S. federal government to be more transparent about where it is sending the aid money. But she said her group still is urging Congress \u201cto make its power of the purse heard\u201d and continue the funding to the nonprofits and NGOs. The $2 billion that Congress appropriated for the Northern Triangle beginning in 2016 was to be distributed at about $700 million a year, although groups say the latest distributions have been less. The U.S. assistance was part of the Alliance for Prosperity , a regional plan created by the governments of Northern Triangle countries after tens of thousands of families and children traveling alone arrived on the U.S.-Mexico border. The three countries put $8.6 billion of their money into the plan\u2019s objectives of tackling the region\u2019s insecurity and poverty that have been driving people to leave. But the effort is running into the current U.S. administration that campaigned on building a wall at the border and stopping illegal immigration. In addition, Trump is up for reelection next year and the number of people being taken into custody at the border is increasing. Some people who once entered legally at ports of entry and requested asylum have been crossing illegally since the administration started limiting asylum-seekers' entry at the ports, adding to the number of people that U.S. Border Patrol agents have to handle and sending daily apprehension numbers to levels last seen in 2006. Most of the migrants are coming from Central America. Funding, aid help to 'push out the border' Marco Lopez, president of the international advisory group Intermestic Partners, said that since the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the nation\u2019s strategy has been to \u201cpush out our border\u201d and inspect people before they get to our physical land barrier. \u201cThe more we can do in countries farther from us to deter people from coming or to inspect people before they get to our physical land barrier, the better off we are \u2026 This is exactly the opposite of what this will do and what I don\u2019t think the president understands.\u201d Many experts point to the example of the U.S. assistance to Colombia that saw large outmigration in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s when the country was wracked by drug cartel violence, guerrilla warfare and economic instability. The U.S. has spent billions helping Colombia, largely focusing on its drug eradication but also targeting the country\u2019s judiciary and economy. U.S. aid alone did not bring stability and peace to Colombia. But Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington think tank, said lessons could be learned from Plan Colombia even though it did not resolve the drug problem. \u201cThe main impact was enabling the Colombian state to assert itself and gain control over its territory and stabilize an extremely violent situation,\u201d Shifter said. Another important lesson is that it took time and heavy resources on the ground. \u201cIn Plan Colombia, there was tremendous engagement in the level of training, cooperation, advisory and a wide range of support. That has not been sufficient in Central America.\u201d Furthermore, Colombia had a stronger state and stronger institutional development than the Northern Triangle countries, so the challenge is even greater in some ways, according to Shifter. \u201cAnd the experience with U.S. policy on Latin America is that threats usually don\u2019t work very well. I\u2019m doubtful that it will work in this case either.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "victor j. blue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suzanne gamboa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carmen sesin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dafna rand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "getty images", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mercy corps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "retalhuleu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern triangle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guatemala", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T03:24:54.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "016aa1df363ecca8680e9c2f3bdd4418b64f233d", "url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.8b13157", "site_full": "pubs.acs.org", "site": "acs.org", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jacsat", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)", "title": "[ASAP] Capturing Intermediates in the Reaction Catalyzed by NosN, a Class C Radical S -Adenosylmethionine Methylase Involved in the Biosynthesis of the Nosiheptide Side-Ring System", "title_full": "[ASAP] Capturing Intermediates in the Reaction Catalyzed by NosN, a Class C Radical S -Adenosylmethionine Methylase Involved in the Biosynthesis of the Nosiheptide Side-Ring System", "published": "2019-04-01T07:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jacsat/0/jacsat.ahead-of-print/jacs.8b13157/20190401/images/medium/ja-2018-131572_0011.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3320, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "016aa1df363ecca8680e9c2f3bdd4418b64f233d", "url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.8b13157", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bo Wang, Joseph W.

It contains a bicyclic structure composed of a large macrocycle and a unique side-ring system containing a 3,4-dimethylindolic acid bridge connected to the side chains of Glu6 and Cys8 of the core peptide via ester and thioester linkages, respectively. In addition to the structural peptide, encoded by the nosM gene, the biosynthesis of the side-ring structure requires the actions of NosI, -J, -K, -L, and -N. NosN is annotated as a class C radical S -adenosylmethionine (SAM) methylase, but its true function is to transfer a C1 unit from SAM to C4 of 3-methyl-2-indolic acid (MIA) with concomitant formation of a bond between the carboxylate of Glu6 of the core peptide and the nascent C1 unit. However, exactly when NosN performs its function during the biosynthesis of nosiheptide is unknown. Herein, we report the syntheses and use of three peptide mimics as potential substrates designed to address the timing of NosN\u2019s function. Our results show that NosN clearly closes the side ring before NosO forms the pyridine ring and most likely before NosD/E catalyzes formation of the dehydrated amino acids, although the possibility of a more random process (i.e., NosN acting after NosD/E) cannot be ruled out. Using a substrate mimic containing a rigid structure, we also identify and characterize two reaction-based adducts containing SAM fused to C4 of MIA. The two SAM adducts are derived from a consensus radical-containing species proposed to be the key intermediate\u2014or a derivative of the key intermediate\u2014in our proposed catalytic mechanism of NosN. 10.1021/jacs.8b13157 .

Mark Ronson (@iammarkronson) 21/23 Isla Fisher and Sacha Baron Cohen are known for their playful relationship, so much so that Fisher couldn't help but poke fun at her husband's Golden Globe loss for best actor in a musical or comedy for 'Who is America?' \"My husband WON!... not,\" Fisher cheekily wrote on Instagram.

Alex Borstein, who stars in comedy-drama 'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel', shared a photo on Instagram that showed her having an eye and neck mask applied while simultaneously having her hair curled. The definition of a multitasker.

Your leadership in preparing a concise declaration to mark the 25 th anniversary of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), in lieu of negotiating a resolution which would have likely expanded to include contentious topics, has allowed us to reach a consensus this year.\nWhile we will share further thoughts in our national statement later, I wanted to take this opportunity to make important points of clarification on language in the declaration related to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the ICPD Programme of Action.\nWe underscore that the 2030 Agenda is non-binding and does not create or affect rights or nor does it create any new financial commitments. The United States recognizes the 2030 Agenda as a global framework for sustainable development that can help countries work toward global peace and prosperity. We applaud the call for shared responsibility, including national responsibility, in the 2030 Agenda and emphasize that all countries have a role to play in achieving its vision. The 2030 Agenda recognizes that each country must work toward implementation in accordance with its own national policies and priorities.\nThe United States also underscores that paragraph 18 of the 2030 Agenda calls for countries to implement the Agenda in a manner that is consistent with the rights and obligations of States under international law. We also highlight our mutual recognition in paragraph 58 that 2030 Agenda implementation must respect and be without prejudice to the independent mandates of other processes and institutions, including negotiations, and does not prejudge or serve as precedent for decisions and actions underway in other forums.

(April 1, 2019) - Today, the U.S. (EPA) announced significant accomplishments at two Superfund sites on the Administrator's Emphasis List of Superfund Sites Targeted for Immediate, Intense Action (Administrator's Emphasis List). After achieving critical short-term milestones, the Madison County Anschutz Mine, Fredericktown, Missouri and Tar Creek, Ottawa County, Oklahoma were removed from the list. One site - Olin Chemical, Wilmington, Massachusetts \u2013 was added to facilitate cleanup and redevelopment activities. With this update, there are a total of 15 Superfund sites on the list, and a total of 13 sites have been removed from the Administrator's Emphasis List since December 2017 because the short-term milestones were achieved.\n\"Removing Madison County Anschutz Mine and Tar Creek from the Administrator's Emphasis List and adding Olin Chemical demonstrate EPA's continued progress in accelerating cleanup activities that protect human health and the environment while revitalizing local communities,\" said EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler. \"The cleanups at these sites further the commitment EPA made in the federal Lead Action Plan to address lead contamination at Superfund sites and reduce exposure to residents.\"\nThe Madison County Anschutz Mine was placed on the Administrator's Emphasis List to promote the timely implementation of a property-wide cleanup of historical surficial mine waste contamination proposed by the new owners, which will also allow for the beneficial re-use of the property and potentially create significant economic benefit for the local community. The new property owners intend to re-open a former cobalt mine, which could employ hundreds of residents. EPA and the new owners signed an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent to conduct the work. Sitewide, the EPA has completed the remediation of over 626,000 cubic yards of soil at more than 1,900 residential properties in and around Fredericktown, in addition to cleaning up approximately 87 acres of mine waste. EPA's response actions have resulted in a significant reduction of elevated blood lead in children throughout Madison County where the percentage has dropped from around 27 percent in 1996, to less than 2 percent today.\nEPA released a draft strategic plan to advance the cleanup of the Tar Creek Superfund site on March 11, 2019. The release of the strategic plan fulfills two major milestones identified for the site on the Administrator's Emphasis List. The first milestone required identification and evaluation of opportunities to accelerate site cleanup. The second milestone compelled EPA and the Bureau of Indian Affairs to work with the Quapaw Nation to establish the tribe's ability to establish institutional controls on their properties. Some near-term cleanup actions include the partial deletion of up to 5,000 acres, amending the 2008 record of decision for mining waste, and issuing a new record of decision for the watersheds. Long-term actions include exploring innovative technologies to expedite the cleanup and identifying additional re-use opportunities. Prior cleanup activities at the site resulted in a significant reduction of elevated blood lead levels in children from 35 percent to 4 percent.\nThe Olin Chemical Superfund site was added to the Administrator's Emphasis List with the goal of expediting the selection of a remedy to remediate soil, surface water, and areas of highest groundwater contamination. EPA also hopes to work cooperatively with developers and local officials regarding potential reuse plans for the former Olin property The site was originally added to the National Priorities List in April 2006. Under the Trump Administration, the Superfund program has reemerged as a priority to fulfill the EPA's core mission of protecting human health and the environment.\nBackground\nEPA established the Administrator's Emphasis List in December 2017 in response to recommendations from EPA's Superfund Task Force. Each site on the Administrator's Emphasis List has a short-term milestone to provide the basis for tracking progress at the site. EPA will consider removing a site from the list once the milestone is achieved. Removal from the Administrator's Emphasis List does not change the site'\u2019s status on the National Priorities List.\nEPA remains dedicated to addressing risks at all Superfund sites, not just those on the Administrator's Emphasis List.

Blackbaud Peer-to-Peer Fundraising\u2122, powered by JustGiving\u2122, delivers an unparalleled opportunity for social good organizations, such as nonprofits, schools, healthcare institutions, and churches, to empower supporters to fundraise on their behalf. Brad Little, managing director, Blackbaud Consumer Solutions U.S., and Mary Beth Westmoreland, Blackbaud's chief technology officer, announced the company's new solution on stage at the Peer-to-Peer Professional Forum conference today in New Orleans, La.\nIn 2017, Blackbaud acquired JustGiving , the world's leading social platform for giving, which has enabled people in 160 countries to raise more than $5.5 billion for causes they care about. At the time, Blackbaud emphasized its commitment to providing intuitive peer-to-peer fundraising designed with both organizations and individuals in mind. The launch of Blackbaud Peer-to-Peer Fundraising elevates the company's entire peer-to-peer portfolio while disrupting the market landscape by providing its premier solution at no subscription cost.\n\"Blackbaud Peer-to-Peer Fundraising, powered by JustGiving, delivers on a promise we made to make it easy for our customers to give their own supporters tools to achieve shared fundraising priorities that lead to real outcomes,\" said Westmoreland. \"We wanted to exceed expectations by making this best-in-class cloud solution available with no subscription fee for more than 1.5 million organizations to use, with a dedicated team to help them get started.\"\nWith peer-to-peer fundraising, individuals support causes they care about by rallying people in their own networks to contribute. Donors enjoy both a direct, transparent connection to the recipients of their gifts and the simplicity of making a contribution without physically attending an event. More than one in five Americans reported contributing to an online social fundraising campaign in 2016 1 , with those numbers continuing to grow year over year. And while younger generations are most likely to participate in peer-to-peer fundraising events, older generations are most likely to sponsor those participants 2 \u2014representing a unique opportunity to unite diverse age groups with a shared mission.\nBlackbaud's new solution harnesses these growing trends for its customers by making a direct connection between their fundraising campaigns and supporters who can engage their networks through virtual events, giving days, livestream fundraising and more.\n\"As the fundraising industry continues to experience radical change due to digital transformation and the proliferation of mobile technology, never before has an individual donor felt more connected or more empowered,\" said Little. \"At the same time, social good organizations are now challenged to find and build relationships with their next generation of supporters. Blackbaud Peer-to-Peer Fundraising, powered by JustGiving, meets that challenge with a purpose-built platform where social good organizations will want to send their supporters\u2014and where their supporters will want to engage. The platform and new partnerships will also help to bring great causes to individuals looking to make a difference.\"\nThis latest addition to Blackbaud's comprehensive peer-to-peer portfolio reaffirms the company's continued commitment to driving innovation that strengthens the social economy. Just last year, Blackbaud TeamRaiser \u00ae , the industry-leading event fundraising solution, expanded to offer an integration with Facebook that increased both dollars raised and efficiency in managing campaigns\u2014demonstrating a simpler, more enjoyable experience for donors and organizations alike. With today's announcement, Blackbaud is uniquely positioned to offer a fundraising platform to individuals while providing organizations with the invaluable opportunity to grow their supporter pipelines.\n\"Blackbaud Peer-to-Peer Fundraising has helped us grow exponentially, providing more information about donors and a simplified user experience,\" said Maree Stewart, donor relations coordinator at early adopter customer Marshfield Clinic in Marshfield, Wis. \"With Blackbaud Peer-to-Peer Fundraising, we have seen a significant increase in the number of fundraisers held by volunteers to benefit our organization. It helps to draw a connection to Marshfield, giving supporters an opportunity to not only express their gratitude but to share their story\u2014which is part of the healing process. Giving people an avenue to share while making a difference is so beneficial.\"\nBlackbaud Peer-to-Peer Fundraising helps organizations to raise more funds, share passion, and grow impact by providing unrivaled reach. Key benefits include:\nBlackbaud will not charge a subscription fee on this modern, mobile-optimized solution. Customized landing pages allow organizations to add their own brand to enhance their supporters' experience. Organizations using Blackbaud Peer-to-Peer Fundraising can set up unlimited campaigns with any number of administrators. Offers integration with Blackbaud Merchant Services \u2122 (BBMS) Forthcoming integration with Blackbaud's solutions for fundraising and relationship management services\u2014which will offer groundbreaking insights into constituent behavior without any additional effort.

Boeing 737 airplanes are pictured on the company's production line, on March 27, 2019 in Renton, Washington. Photo by Stephen Brashear/Getty Images/AFP\u00c2 NEW YORK, USA \u2013 Boeing must perform more work on its proposed fix to 737 MAX aircraft before it can be submitted for review, US officials said Monday, suggesting the planes could stay grounded a while longer. Additional work is needed \"to ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues,\" a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said in a statement. \"The FAA will not approve the software for installation until the agency is satisfied with the submission,\" he added. The FAA statement is the bureaucratic equivalent of a \"stop\" sign after Boeing officials touted their proposed remedy last week during a media tour at the company's manufacturing plant in Seattle, Washington. Boeing's 737 MAX planes were grounded globally last month following the second of two deadly crashes to occur in less than 5 months. Scrutiny has centered on an anti-stall system developed specifically for the planes that has given pilots problems. A preliminary report into the second calamity \u2013 the March 10 crash of a Boeing 737 MAX 8 that killed 157 people \u2013 will likely be issued this week, the Ethiopian government said Monday. Boeing last week gathered hundreds of pilots and reporters at its Renton, Washington manufacturing site for a presentation on proposed changes to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which is believed to have been a key factor in the Ethiopian crash and in an October crash of a Lion Air in Indonesia that killed 189 people. Among the changes, the MCAS will no longer repeatedly make corrections when the pilot tries to regain control, and will automatically disconnect in the event of disagreements between the two \"angle of attack,\" or AOA sensors, the company said last week. Boeing is anxious to win approval for a proposed remedy that could get the planes back in the air. But the FAA, which faced harsh questioning last week at a congressional hearing regarding its oversight of Boeing, said it expected Boeing to submit the proposed fix \"over the coming weeks\" after it undertakes additional work. After that, the proposal will be submitted to a \"rigorous safety review,\" the FAA spokesman said. A source with knowledge of the investigation has said an anti-stalling system , the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), was activated shortly before the crash. Boeing designed the automated MCAS system \u2013 which lowers the aircraft's nose if it detects a stall or loss of airspeed \u2013 for this particular model. The same system was implicated in the October crash, with initial investigations finding that a sensor on the plane had transmitted incorrect information to the MCAS system. The pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 struggled to control the aircraft as the MCAS repeatedly pushed the plane's nose down, according to the flight data recorder. The pilot had tried repeatedly to regain control and pull the nose up but the plane crashed into the sea. Both the planes in Indonesia and Ethiopia reportedly experienced erratic steep climbs and descents, as well as fluctuating airspeeds, before crashing shortly after takeoff. Ethiopia has already said there were \"clear similarities\" between the two MAX 8 crashes. Ethiopian Airlines is Africa's largest carrier and in many ways the international face of the nation. \u2013 Rappler.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stephen brashear/getty images/afp\u00e2", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "us & canada boeing", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "boeing", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "federal aviation administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "renton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T03:46:29.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "efa5861c7794cb6f729380489ee570a96119a03f", "url": "https://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001024945/article/steelers-release-s-morgan-burnett-after-one-season", "site_full": "www.nfl.com", "site": "nfl.com", "site_section": "https://www.nfl.com/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "NFL.com - Official Site of the National Football League | NFL.com", "title": "Steelers release S Morgan Burnett after one season", "title_full": "Steelers release S Morgan Burnett after one season - NFL.com", "published": "2019-04-01T19:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2019/04/01/0ap3000001024944_thumbnail_200_150.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 992, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 13, "comments": 5, "shares": 25}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "efa5861c7794cb6f729380489ee570a96119a03f", "url": "https://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001024945/article/steelers-release-s-morgan-burnett-after-one-season", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kevin Patra", "published": "2019-04-01T19:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Steelers release S Morgan Burnett after one season", "text": "Morgan Burnett 's run in Pittsburgh lasted just one season.\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers announced the release of the veteran safety on Monday.\nLATEST ANALYSIS\n \u25b6 Head coaches offer advice to newbies\n \u25b6 First-round trades that should happen\n \u25b6 NFC North roster reset\n \u25b6 Why Oliver should go top five\n \u25b6 Which playoff team is in most trouble?\n \u25b6 Top 5 rivalries for 2019\nBurnett signed a three-year, $14.35 million contract with the Steelers in 2018.

In a report published today, Reuters cited recent data from the United States Department of Agriculture that says nearly half of all imported vegetables and 40 percent of imported fruits are grown in Mexico.\nWhile there are other countries that produce the fruits and vegetables we consume, it would take time to adjust trade plans. One of the most imminent problems we'd face would be an avocado shortage, should the border actually close in the next week.\nSteve Barnard, the president of Mission Produce, the largest distributor and grower of avocados in the world, told Reuters that because Mexico supplies most of the avocados sold in the U.S. at this time of year, closing the border would mean running out of avocados in as little as three weeks.\nCalifornia's growing season is just starting, so avocados grown there wouldn't be ready for another month or so. Of note, Barnard told Reuters that California has a \"very small crop.\" Depending on how long trade was halted, that could mean fewer avocados in stores and higher prices on the ones that are available.\nOther produce that could be in short supply include tomatoes, cucumbers, blackberries, and raspberries, the majority of which all currently come from Mexico.\n('You Might Also Like',)\nCrave Carbs?

Korea, U.S. reaffirm commitment to support inter-Korean military accord\n(ATTN: TRIMS; RECASTS throughout)\nWASHINGTON/SEOUL, April 2 (Yonhap) -- The defense chiefs of South Korea and the United States have reaffirmed their commitment to closely coordinating to support last year's inter-Korean military accord aimed at reducing border tensions and building trust, their offices said.\nDuring their talks in Washington on Monday (local time), Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo and acting U.S. Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan also reiterated their will to closely cooperate to expedite the fulfillment of conditions needed for Washington's envisioned transfer of wartime operational control (OPCON) to Seoul.\nJeong and Shanahan met face to face for the first time since the latter took the Pentagon post in January.\n\"The secretary and the minister assessed that implementation of the Comprehensive Military Agreement (CMA) has contributed to the easing of military tension and confidence building on the Korean Peninsula,\" Seoul's defense ministry and the Pentagon said in a press release.\nThe Koreas' defense chiefs signed the CMA at the close of the third summit between President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang last September. It entails a series of trust-building and arms control measures under a broader scheme to halt all hostile acts against each other.\nJeong and Shanahan underscored their will to further reinforce the alliance through the \"synchronized\" efforts of their militaries amid ongoing peace efforts with North Korea.\n\"The secretary and minister affirmed that the U.S.-ROK alliance is 'ironclad' and ready to face an evolving security environment,\" the press release reads. ROK stands for South Korea's official name, the Republic of Korea.\n\"The two sides reaffirmed the commitment to maintain an unwavering combined readiness posture while continuing to support the ongoing diplomatic efforts to achieve complete denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula,\" it added.\nGen. Robert Abrams, the commander of the South Korea-U.S. Combined Forces Command, gave the defense chiefs an evaluation of the allies' new exercise staged last month. He said that it has strengthened the militaries' combined readiness and contributed to the groundwork for the OPCON transfer.\nAbrams was referring to the Dong Maeng command post exercise that replaced the Key Resolve exercise. Dong Maeng is the Korean word for alliance.\nCritics discounted the new exercise as a downsized version of the Key Resolve, raising concerns that it could undermine the allies' defense posture. But Shanahan disagreed.\n\"I don't think we're scaling back exercises. I think we're building capability up,\" the acting secretary said.\nHe added that the allies learned \"lessons\" from the new exercise and will look to apply them to future drills.\n\"We want to make sure that there are no gaps or seams, and that we continue to build on these exercises,\" he said. \"We're going to talk about the September exercises and the lessons learned from these ones in March.\"\nJeong said that the March drills concluded \"successfully\" and added that it served as a \"useful\" opportunity to confirm the allies' defense posture.\nThe two sides also agreed to work toward initial operational capability (IOC) certification of a South Korea-led combined defense posture later this year, and committed to stay in close consultation, the press release said.\nSeoul and Washington have been pushing for the conditions-based OPCON transfer after which the former will lead wartime operations with the latter playing a supporting role.\nFollowing the IOC certification slated for this summer, the two sides are expected to verify Seoul's full operational and mission capabilities in the following years.\nThis photo shows South Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo (L) meeting with acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan (R) at the Pentagon, near Washington, on April 1, 2019.

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo Reuters\nBy Arshad Mohammed, Patricia Zengerle and Richard Cowan\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - People inside and outside the Trump administration scrambled on Monday to figure out what aid it plans to cut from three Central American nations and how that is a good idea given that much of the money aims to curb migration.\nThe State Department said on Saturday it would carry out President Donald Trump's repeated threats to end U.S. foreign assistance programs with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.\nWithout providing evidence, Trump said on Friday the countries had \"set up\" caravans of migrants in order to export them to the United States. A surge of asylum seekers from the three countries, known collectively as the Northern Triangle, has sought to enter the United States in recent days.\nCongressional aides and U.S. officials said they were trying to establish what money would be eliminated, and even some of Trump's fellow Republicans questioned the wisdom of curbing the aid, much of which aims to reduce violence, gang activity and the illicit drug trade - all factors that send migrants north.\n\"If we cut all this funding, and a lot of it, quite honestly, is seriously law enforcement that we're doing down there ... I think it's going to make things tragically worse, not better,\" said Representative Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee.\nThe State Department did not elaborate beyond its weekend statement that it was \"carrying out the President's direction and ending FY 2017 and FY 2018 foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle\" and would engage Congress. The U.S. fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30.\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, one congressional aide said it was his understanding the administration planned to reprogram \u2013 or dedicate to other purposes \u2013 about $450 million in fiscal-year 2018 funds.\nIn addition, according to the aide, the department planned to review fiscal-year 2017 and 2018 funds that have been obligated, but not spent, and redirect those to other purposes.\nThe aide and others said, however, that Congress had yet to receive any formal notices from the State Department about exactly which funds are involved, what they were originally for or where the department wants to reprogram them.\nAsked if the department knew what programs would be cut, a second congressional aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said: \"If they do, they haven't told us yet. My sense is they are trying to figure that out.\"\n'TOTALLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE'\nA former U.S. official in contact with those still in the government said emails were flying around the State Department among officials trying to figure out what was going on.\n\"Nobody knows what this is,\" he said, adding that by midday on Monday, no instructions had been sent to U.S. aid missions in the region on how to implement the decision.\nThe situation was reminiscent of a 2018 New Year's Day tweet in which Trump appeared to decree an end to U.S. aid for Pakistan, sending officials scrambling to suspend security aid without even knowing how much they were freezing.\nCritics argued the administration's planned Central America aid cutoff would be tantamount to cutting off its nose to spite its face.\n\"It's totally counterproductive,\" said Rebecca Bill Chavez, who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for Western Hemisphere Affairs during former President Barack Obama's administration and who is now at the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington.\n\"If the intent is to slow migration, this is going to have the opposite effect,\" she added.\nSpeaking on ABC News' \"This Week\" program on Sunday, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said the United States needed more help from the \"Northern Triangle\" countries and Mexico, where the migrants typically enter the United States.\n\"You can make all the promises you want but when you're still sending 100,000 people across the southern border, actions speak louder than words,\" Mulvaney said. \"We want to work with the Northern Triangle countries but we need their assistance.\"\nDemocrats were scathing about the planned cuts.\n\"Most of this aid is intended to address the causes of migration - reduce poverty, violence, gangs, improve rule of law, and reform justice systems,\" said Senator Patrick Leahy, the senior Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"It is shooting ourselves in the foot to cut off the assistance.\"\n(Reporting by Arshad Mohammed, Patricia Zengerle and Richard Cowan; Additional reporting by Jonathan Landay and Lesley Wroughton; Writing By Arshad Mohammed; Editing by Peter Cooney)\nCopyright 2019 Thomson Reuters .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "patricia zengerle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard cowan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arshad mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "central america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tijuana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el salvador", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern triangle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guatemala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "honduras", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T04:16:33.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "81b0b953db2288bdceddc56c19627f7f516422ee", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2766864027", "site_full": "www.goodreads.com", "site": "goodreads.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["books_and_literature", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "Maeve \u2655 Maevereads (The United States)\u2019s review of Silence: A Thirteenth-Century French Romance", "title_full": "Maeve \u2655 Maevereads (The United States)\u2019s review of Silence: A Thirteenth-Century French Romance", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.099, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 300, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "81b0b953db2288bdceddc56c19627f7f516422ee", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2766864027", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Unknown", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Maeve \u2655 Maevereads (The United States)\u2019s review of Silence: A Thirteenth-Century French Romance", "text": "photo Flag Abuse Flagging a post will send it to the Goodreads Customer Care team for review.

GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares rise to 7-month high on U.S., China manufacturing rebound * Australian shares add 0.8 pct, Japan&apos;s Nikkei up 0.4 pct\n* Investors cheer U.S. March manufacturing activity improvement\n* U.S. retail sales post unexpected drop in Feb.\n* Sterling takes knock on Brexit uncertainty\n* Asian stock markets: https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\nBy Daniel Leussink\nTOKYO, April 2 (Reuters) - Asia shares extended their rally on Tuesday as factory activity surveys from China and the United States boosted investor confidence, triggering the largest one-day sell-off in the U.S. Treasury market in nearly three months.\nMSCI&apos;s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 0.3 percent to a seven-month high after rallying more than one percent in the previous session.\nAustralian shares .AXJO gained 0.8 percent while Japan&apos;s Nikkei .N225 advanced 0.4 percent, extending its gains for a third session.\nWall Street shares jumped on Monday, with the S&P 500 .SPX and Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI both rising more than one percent, with the Dow lifted by sharp gains in Caterpillar Inc (NYSE: CAT ) CAT.N and Boeing (NYSE: BA ) Co BA.N .\nInvestors cheered U.S. data overnight showing improvements in manufacturing activity last month and construction spending for February, which overshadowed an unexpected drop in retail sales. upbeat readings added to earlier data showing China&apos;s manufacturing sector surprisingly returned to growth for the first time in four months in March in a sign government stimulus steps were starting to be felt. rare bright news for the global economy comes in the wake of persistent worries over cooling demand across the world, with the Sino-U.S. tariff dispute, slowing trade and corporate profits prompting investors to dump risk assets over the past several months.\n\"The market is reacting to the improvement of the sentiment in China. Many investors are buying in anticipation of a rise in shares,\" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) Securities.\n\"But thinking about how things really are, at the end of the week (U.S.) jobless claims will be released and it&apos;s true that individual consumption, which accounts for 70 percent of gross domestic product, hasn&apos;t been good. I think that has to be taken into account,\" Fujito said.\nThe encouraging data on manufacturing activity in the world&apos;s two biggest economies led to a wobbly start to the U.S. bond market, with the U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields US10YT=RR booking their largest single-day jump since Jan. 4.\nThe U.S. 10-year Treasury yield overnight jumped to a more than one-week high of 2.502 percent, moving off a 15-month low of 2.340 percent touched on March 25.\nThe rise pushed the yield curve between three-month U.S. Treasury bills and 10-year notes further into positive territory, after being inverted for a week until last Friday.\nBREXIT CHAOS\nIn the currency market, sterling took a knock after British lawmakers came no nearer to resolving the chaos surrounding the country&apos;s departure from the European Union.\nThe British parliament failed on Monday to find a majority of its own for any alternative to Prime Minister Theresa May&apos;s divorce deal. only sensible thing for Theresa May to do is to step aside and let someone else take control of Brexit,\" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets in London.\n\"Failure to chose any of the options on Brexit took the floor under sterling and the currency stumbled like a rock,\" Aslam said in a note to clients.\nSterling was last down 0.25 percent at $1.3073 GBP=D4 , not far from last month&apos;s nadir of $1.2945.\nThe euro struggled near a three-week low of $1.1198 EUR= brushed early on Tuesday, and was last trading down a tenth of a percent at $1.1204.\nAgainst the Japanese yen, the dollar was down a tad at 111.33 yen JPY= , but 1.5 percent above its 1-1/2-month low of 109.70 touched on March 25.\nOil prices hovered near their four-month peaks, after two key benchmarks booked their largest first-quarter gains in nearly a decade on positive signs for the global economy and tighter supplies. O/R\nU.S. crude futures CLc1 traded at $61.92 per barrel, up half a percent on the day. Brent futures LCOc1 were up 0.4 percent at $69.28 a barrel.\nGold XAU= was 0.15 percent higher at $1,289.10.\n(Editing by Shri Navaratnam)\nGLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares rise to 7-month high on U.S., China manufacturing rebound", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=179222828858436&u=https%3A%2F%2Fau.investing.com%2Fnews%2Fstock-market-news%2Fglobal-marketsasian-shares-rise-to-7month-high-on-us-china-manufacturing-rebound-1420064&display=popup&ref=plugin", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fau.investing.com%2Fnews%2Fstock-market-news%2Fglobal-marketsasian-shares-rise-to-7month-high-on-us-china-manufacturing-rebound-1420064&title=GLOBAL+MARKETS-Asian+shares+rise+to+7-month+high+on+U.S.%2C+China+manufacturing+rebound&summary="], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "daniel leussink", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "axjo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "msci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. treasury", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia-pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tokyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T04:21:58.059+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5ee352d5f89ad3014d09af8286cfaa245a73ad5e", "url": "https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?oid=077&aid=0004448149", "site_full": "news.naver.com", "site": "naver.com", "site_section": "https://openapi.naver.com/v1/search/news?query=a&start=11&sort=date&display=100", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "", "title": "Thailand Politics What?s Next Analysis", "title_full": "Thailand Politics What?s Next Analysis : \ub124\uc774\ubc84 \ub274\uc2a4", "published": "2019-04-02T03:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "KR", "spam_score": 0.014, "main_image": "https://imgnews.pstatic.net/image/origin/077/2019/04/02/4448149.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 89, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5ee352d5f89ad3014d09af8286cfaa245a73ad5e", "url": "https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?oid=077&aid=0004448149", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "AP\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4 | \ub124\uc774\ubc84", "published": "2019-04-02T03:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Thailand Politics What?s Next Analysis", "text": "FILE - In this March 27, 2019, file photo, workers load campaign billboards displayed to promote candidates for a general election into a truck in Bangkok, Thailand.

We will submit a proposal on an extra budget in April to the National Assembly,\" Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon said.\n\"The government should take every policy measure at its disposal preemptively,\" he added.\nThe main focus of the proposed budget will be placed on ways to tackle fine dust and brace for growing downside economic risks, the officials said.\n\"I've heard the finance ministry is considering drawing up a supplementary budget. I hope it could focus on coping with fine dust,\" DP chairman Lee Hae-chan said.\nThe National Assembly passed a bill that designates fine dust as a social disaster last month as the country is struggling to reduce fine dust, a large portion of which is believed to originate from China.\nThe budget, if approved, could be used in increasing the use of air purifiers and expanding joint projects with China, the presidential office said in March.\nParticipants also discussed ways to provide assistance to the southeastern city of Pohang, which was hit by a strong earthquake in 2017.\nA state-led investigation team said last month that the Pohang quake, the country's second-most destructive earthquake, was probably triggered by an experimental geothermal power plant that harnesses energy from the ground.\nIn November 2017, a 5.4 magnitude earthquake struck Pohang, injuring nearly 120 people and causing property damage worth 84.6 billion won (US$74.6 million).\nThe officials agreed to push for enacting a special law on the Pohang quake and forming a special committee tasked with looking into the incident.\nKim Soo-hyun, senior presidential secretary for policy, vowed efforts to take necessary actions to prop up the economy.\n\"The government will spur efforts to revitalize the economy,\" he said. \"We will make all-out efforts to boost key manufacturers that are in the midst of a slowdown and venture firms.\"\nPrime Minister Lee Nak-yon (2nd from R) speaks in a meeting of senior officials from the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae, the government and the ruling Democratic Party held at the National Assembly on April 2, 2019, to discuss ways to cope with the fallout of a 2017 quake in the southeastern city of Pohang.
