BJP led-NDA government on the other hand ensured that even the minorities got their due in the last five years, he said, adding that reluctance of the previous Congress and current coalition government to implement the Anwar Manippady report shows their true colours.\nAddressing reporters here, Anwar said if the successive governments had implemented the report submitted by him on Waqf scam; it would have changed the way minorities obtained their rightful due in the development story. Then BJP government in 2013 had enacted laws to recover Waqf property valued at Rs 2.3-lakh crore, but the report has not yet seen the light of the day due to reluctance of the successive state governments, he said.\nReferring to the recent development in this prolonged battle to get the government to table the report in the legislature, Anwar said Justices S A Bobde and Abdul Nazeer of Supreme Court on March 15 dismissed a special leave petition filed by the state government that challenged orders of Karnataka High Court directing it to table the report. The state government now has no option but to table the report, Anwar said.\nThe effect of the SC dismissing the SLP will force the state government to restore 28000 plus acres of encroached Waqf land, three medical colleges, 12 engineering colleges and hundreds of professional colleges, schools, complexes, malls, five star hotels and Rs 88 crore of monthly revenue which the Waqf Board is now misappropriating, he said, adding this money will benefit the economically backward among Muslims in the state.\nAnwar was also critical of the move by AICC chief Rahul Gandhi to contest from minority dominated Wayanad LS constituency in Kerala and for harping on the idea of \u2018Hindu terror\u2019 at an election campaign. Describing the former as a continued politics of appeasement, he said the latter utterance was nothing short of contempt for the majority population of the nation of which he is aspiring to become the Prime Minister, Anwar noted.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anwar manippady", "sentiment": "negative"},

Covering Synthetic Bacteriophage 8 hrs ago Save\nLOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr 2, 2019--C3J Therapeutics, Inc. (C3J) a private clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the development of novel targeted antimicrobials based on bacteriophage, today announced that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has issued patent No. 10,221,398, entitled \u201cCompositions of and Methods for In Vitro Viral Genome Engineering.\u201d The patent, which covers the composition of a synthetically engineered Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage, is an important addition to C3J\u2019s expanding patent estate, and the Company\u2019s first issued patent covering its proprietary technology platform that enhances natural bacteriophage through genetic engineering. The patent includes claims intended to improve host range and increase the antimicrobial activity of wild type (natural) phage, including activity against biofilm. C3J possesses a significant library of naturally occurring phage and other biological materials that are critical for the creation of synthetic phage via the C3J phage engineering platform.\nC3J is committed to protecting its novel therapeutics in key jurisdictions. Related international patent applications are currently under examination in several countries. These applications support C3J\u2019s work in building a strong intellectual property portfolio around its technology and strengthening its leadership position in the field of synthetic phage-based therapies.\nTodd Patrick, President and Chief Executive Officer of C3J, said, \u201cThis is an important patent for our company. Not only does it strengthen our program in Pseudomonas aeruginosa but it also exemplifies our strategy of protecting each individual phage that is created using our synthetic biology-based phage engineering platform.\u201d\nOn January 4, 2019, C3J and AmpliPhi Biosciences Corporation (\u201cAmpliPhi\u201d) (NYSE American: APHB), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of precisely targeted bacteriophage therapeutics for antibiotic-resistant infections, announced that the companies have agreed to merge.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190402005061/en/\n(Graphic: Business Wire)\nRedirecting the Attribution of Prestige\nThe Social Mobility Index ranks nearly 1,400 four-year U.S. colleges and universities according to how successfully they hold down tuition, enroll students from low-income backgrounds and graduate students into promising careers. Each state's SMI ranking is derived from the average SMI ranking of all the colleges and universities located within that state. The goal of the SMI -- now in its fifth year -- is to help redirect the attribution of \"prestige\" in the higher education system toward colleges and universities that are advancing economic mobility -- the most pressing civic issue of our time.\n\u201cMost higher education rankings evaluate colleges and universities as if comparing brands for consumer purchase,\u201d says Jim Wolfston , CEO of CollegeNET. \u201cThe SMI, on the other hand, helps policymakers, students and their families see which colleges and universities are doing the most to drive U.S. economic mobility and thus restore the American Dream.\u201d\nMany Paths Lead to Advancing Economic Opportunity\nVarious factors impact a state\u2019s standing on the SMI.\nCalifornia colleges and universities deliver the third highest graduation rate in the country. In addition, among the group of top-20 schools for graduation rate, California schools enroll the fifth highest percentage of economically disadvantaged students in the nation. And, when they graduate from colleges and universities in California, students enjoy some of the highest median early-career salaries -- $51,851, on average. All of these factors -- but especially the high graduation rate -- have helped California retain its #1 SMI ranking between 2015 and 2018.\nThe state of Washington has improved its SMI ranking more than any other state in the five-year period of 2014-2018. During this time, Washington jumped from #26 to #14 on the SMI, in large measure because the state\u2019s colleges and universities increased their percentage enrollment of economically disadvantaged students. Graduates of colleges and universities in Washington also experienced a significant jump in median early-career salaries between 2014 and 2018 -- from $44,930 to $49,924.\nThree other states -- Mississippi, Florida and West Virginia -- have performed well on the SMI using a different approach. The colleges and universities in these states are serving high percentages of economically disadvantaged students while keeping tuitions low. Colleges and universities in Mississippi, for example, serve the highest percentage of students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. And their average tuition is the 9 th lowest among all states -- $11,732 in 2018.\n\u201cDepending on the current profile of a given college or university, there are different approaches it can take to advance economic opportunity among low-income students and thereby achieve a higher SMI ranking,\u201d explains Devin Sills, a Senior Software Engineer at CollegeNET who has helped develop and expand the SMI. \u201cIdeally, all schools in all states would have low tuitions to help facilitate high percentages of students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds graduate into good paying careers. This should definitely be the goal across U.S. higher education if we are seeking to drive economic inclusion and social mobility.\u201d\nEconomic Inclusion Helps Spark Innovative Minds\n\"College education now constitutes the most important rung on the ladder of economic mobility,\u201d adds Wolfston. \u201cBut particularly when it offers a challenging environment populated with diverse personal backgrounds and a wide range of economic experiences, a college does something even more important: it prepares all students to encounter and appreciate the unfamiliar. Given that innovation always depends upon a person\u2019s ability to consider what could be different from their own assumptions and experiences, economic inclusion is thus not only a solution to a social justice issue, it is a key strategy for sparking innovative minds.\"\nAcknowledging Institutional Excellence\nCollegeNET acknowledges schools that are fostering social mobility through innovative programs. CollegeNET presents the annual Social Mobility Innovator Awards to student success leaders from U.S. colleges and universities at the Social Mobility Summit -- an annual forum on economic inclusion and best practices for student success held in Portland, Oregon each summer. CollegeNET recently published an e-book that offers best practices from student success professionals who are pioneering innovative programs that support under-served and under-represented students\u2019 academic, personal and financial needs.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190402005061/en/\nCONTACT: Jill Thacker\nKEYWORD: UNITED STATES NORTH AMERICA OREGON\nINDUSTRY KEYWORD: EDUCATION UNIVERSITY ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "collegenet, inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ore.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T19:21:50.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "174990c949ff45bce45bc0c987ddee9c864ff6db", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/inu74501073", "site_full": "twitcasting.tv", "site": "twitcasting.tv", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["television", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "\u8e81\u9b31\u306e\u3044\u306c (@inu74501073) 's Live - TwitCasting", "title_full": "\u8e81\u9b31\u306e\u3044\u306c (@inu74501073) 's Live - TwitCasting", "published": "2019-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://imagegw03.twitcasting.tv/image3/image.twitcasting.tv/image76_1/77/d4/1ff2d477-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2374, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "174990c949ff45bce45bc0c987ddee9c864ff6db", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/inu74501073", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "\u8e81\u9b31\u306e\u3044\u306c (@inu74501073) 's Live - TwitCasting", "text": "Title of work being infringed Details\nI read and understand the following notes and send this form.

Wolters, as Commander of U.S. European Command and Supreme Allied Commander Europe; and General Stephen J. Townsend as Commander of U.S. Africa Command. As prepared for delivery:\nGood morning. The Committee meets today to consider the nominations of:\nGeneral Tod D. Wolters, to be Commander of U.S. European Command and Supreme Allied Commander Europe;\nGeneral Stephen J. Townsend to be Commander of U.S. Africa Command.\nThank you to our witnesses and their families for their many years of dedicated service to the nation.\nGeneral Wolters, if confirmed, we will be counting on you to push EUCOM and NATO to adjust to the reality of strategic competition with Russia.\nVladimir Putin will do whatever he can to undermine and divide the West. That includes everything from military force to cyber-attacks to election meddling. We need a new and stronger deterrent that recognizes this range of challenges.\nWe have made a lot of progress in strengthening deterrence against Russia, including through the European Deterrence Initiative. But as General Scaparrotti testified before this committee last month, we\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do in improving our posture and capabilities in Europe.\nWe\u2019ll also be counting on your leadership in NATO, which remains critical for America\u2019s national security 70 years after its creation. America\u2019s commitment to Article 5 is ironclad. Now we need our allies to honor their pledge to reach two percent and invest that money in the capabilities and readiness needed to fight and win. I am glad we have seen progress on this front.\nGeneral Townsend, if confirmed, you will confront an increasingly complex set of challenges across Africa, from the continuing threat posed by terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda to great power competition with China and Russia.\nWhile the challenges in Africa are on the rise, AFRICOM continues to suffer from resource shortfalls. I look to you to explain how these shortfalls increase risk and will impact your ability to execute the National Defense Strategy as well as describe your plan to deal with resourcing challenges.\nThank you again to our nominees for their willingness to continue serving this great nation.

Nissan sales were down 7.2% in March and are off 12% for the year so far.\nToyota said its sales declined 3.5% in March and 5% for the quarter.\nBut Honda Motor Co. not only saw its sales increase last month by 4.3%, but proved passenger cars aren\u2019t completely dead yet reporting a 5% boost in sales for its Accord, a 3.3% bump in Civic sales--a March record and an overall 5.3% in total passenger car sales.\n2019 Honda Civic Sedan Touring\nHonda Motor Co. \u201cOur investment in benchmark products for both Honda and Acura has put us in position to achieve strong sales results, even in a challenging market,\u201d said Henio Arcangeli Jr., senior vice president of the American Honda Automobile Division, in a statement. \u201cWhile some competitors are using fleet sales to boost their numbers in this relatively flat market, our gains across the board are driven by retail customers buying our products one at a time.\u201d\nThe fact remains, however, among the key reasons new vehicle sales seem to have hit a skid pad so far this year is that they simply cost too much. Kelley Blue Book report the average transaction price for a new vehicle in March increased 2% year-over-year to $36,733, which translates to about a $30 bump up in average monthly payments.\nJonathan Smoke, Cox Automotive Chief Economist, briefing reporters in Detroit. January 13, 2019.\nEd Garsten \u201cThe pool of people who can afford to buy a new vehicle is being reduced by higher prices and affordability concerns, and we\u2019re likely seeing signs of that in the sales numbers,\u201d said Jonathan Smoke, Chief Economist at Cox Automotive in emailed comments. \u201cSo far this year, average new vehicle loan payments are up 3.5% compared to last year, to $567, and average lease payments are up 2.8% to $500. As a result of multiple years of rate and price inflation, new vehicles payments have become a big hurdle, driving people into used cars, where the average loan payments is $414, up less than one percent from a year ago.\u201d\nAnalysts have noted in the past new vehicle sales in the second half of the year generally improve, but given the affordability issues exacerbated by concerns over additional import tariffs and smaller federal income tax refunds due to revised laws, there\u2019s little expectation 2019 will feature a back-half bump.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/forbes"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "honda", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T19:32:16.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d567026f3d2a48f167f72863c0606cb2caf97496", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/n_ota_", "site_full": "twitcasting.tv", "site": "twitcasting.tv", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["television", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "nt (@n_ota_) 's Live - TwitCasting", "title_full": "nt (@n_ota_) 's Live - TwitCasting", "published": "2019-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://imagegw03.twitcasting.tv/image3/image.twitcasting.tv/image75_1/0b/e4/1ff2e40b-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2374, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d567026f3d2a48f167f72863c0606cb2caf97496", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/n_ota_", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-03-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "nt (@n_ota_) 's Live - TwitCasting", "text": "Title of work being infringed Details\nI read and understand the following notes and send this form.

For decades Ford Motor Co has had the single best-selling truck brand in its F-Series trucks, with the Chevy brand a solid No. 2, and Ram a distant third.\nIn the fourth quarter the Chevy and Ram brands were tied for second place behind Ford.\nOverall, U.S. new vehicle sales are expected to decline in 2019 after a long bull run since the end of the Great Recession, led by falling passenger car sales. Competition in the high-margin SUV market is also intensifying.\nFord on Tuesday publicly unveiled details of the latest version of its Escape SUV, heavily emphasizing comfort features including a moving rear seat to provide more leg room to passengers, plus consumer-friendly features such as an 8 inch (20.3cm) touchscreen and Wi-Fi connection for up to 10 devices within 50 feet (15.2m) of the vehicle.\nGM posted a 7 percent drop in first-quarter sales, with declines across all brands. Sales of the automaker\u2019s Silverado pickup trucks fell nearly 16 percent and the high-margin Chevy Suburban large SUV dropped 25 percent.\nGM does not report monthly sales.\nFCA reported a 7 percent fall in U.S. sales in March and a 3 percent drop for the first quarter.

Power and LMC Automotive have predicted a 2.1 percent drop in U.S. auto sales in March, partly due to bad weather, mixed economic data and lower tax refunds.\nReporting by Sanjana Shivdas in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber and Susan Thomas Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and may not reflect those of Kitco Metals Inc.

Core capital goods orders increased 2.6 percent on a year-on-year basis.\nShipments of core capital goods were unchanged in February after an upwardly revised 1.0 percent rise in the prior month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government\u2019s gross domestic product measurement.\nThey were previously reported to have gained 0.8 percent in January. The February report was delayed by a 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25. The March report will be published on April 25 as scheduled.\nThe report on Tuesday came on the heels of mixed February retail sales and construction spending reports, as well as January business inventory data, that boosted first-quarter GDP forecasts.\nGrowth estimates for the first-quarter range from as low as a 1.2 percent annualized rate to as high as a 2.1 percent pace. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter, with growth in business spending on equipment accelerating.\nThe economy is losing momentum as the stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut fades. A trade war between the United States and China, slowing global economies and uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union are other factors that are also hurting activity.\nIn February, orders for machinery dropped 0.3 percent after rising 2.0 percent in January. Energy firms have been reducing the oil rigs operating, despite a rebound in oil prices, to focus on growing earnings.\nOrders for computers and electronic products fell 0.3 percent. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components rose 1.0 percent in February after increasing 1.3 percent in the prior month\nThere were also increases in orders for primary metals and for fabricated metal products in February.\nOverall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, tumbled 1.6 percent in February. That reflected a 4.8 percent drop in demand for transportation equipment. Durable goods orders gained 0.1 percent in January.\nOrders for motor vehicles and parts dipped 0.1 percent in February. Orders for non-defense aircraft plunged 31.1 percent after rising 9.2 percent in January.\nBoeing reported on its website that it had received only five aircraft orders in February compared to 46 in January.\nThe fewer orders are probably not related to the Ethiopian Airlines crash in early March, which led to the grounding of Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX aircraft.\nReporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing Andrea Ricci Lucia.Mutikani@thomsonreuters.com; 1 202 898 8315; Reuters Messaging: lucia.mutikani.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and may not reflect those of Kitco Metals Inc.

But on Saturday the U.S. State Department said it was cutting off aid to those three countries.\nMexico began issuing temporary humanitarian visas to some members of a migrant caravan in southern Mexico, giving priority to children and the elderly, the National Migration Institute said Monday. It said it would provide transport back to Central American countries, Cuba and Haiti, on a voluntary basis.\nEarlier this year, Mexico handed out humanitarian visas liberally, but reined in the program after a surge in applications. The institute said from next month it was planning to encourage people to apply for visas in their home countries.\nIt was not immediately clear if the government was limiting the number of visas it issues.\nDetentions at the U.S. border have surged in recent months, angering Trump and putting pressure on Lopez Obrador to find a solution that will prevent a shutdown of the frontier to the market for 80 percent of Mexico\u2019s exports.\nAsked if it was time to put pressure on the Central American countries to do more to tackle the problem, Lopez Obrador said the causes of migration were \u201cnot being attended to\u201d and that people needed to be offered more opportunities there.\n\u201cObviously, we have to help because Central American migrants pass through our territory and we have to bring order to this migration, make sure it\u2019s legal,\u201d Lopez Obrador said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. But serenely, calmly, without a commotion and with great prudence and responsibility.\u201d U.S. CONGRESS MUST APPROVE\nIt quickly became clear that any plan to cut aid to Central America would face strong objections from members of the U.S. Congress, who must approve Trump\u2019s plan for it to become effective.\nOne of his fellow Republicans, Representative Mike McCaul, the top Republican on the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, said cutting the aid would make the situation worse, not better. \u201cIf we cut all this funding ... I think it\u2019s going to make things tragically worse, not better,\u201d he said during a presentation at a think tank in Washington.\nU.S. Border Patrol projections are for over 90,000 apprehensions at the border during March, according to data provided to the Mexican government - a more than 140 percent increase from March 2018, and a seven-fold jump from 2017.\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States was working with the Central American governments and Mexico to \u201csolve this problem at the border,\u201d and pointed to the numbers when asked why Trump had toughened his stance.\n\u201cJust look at the math,\u201d Pompeo told reporters outside the U.S. Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. \u201cHow many folks are coming across. This is a crisis. We need to fix it.\u201d\nPutting a stop to aid to Central America only made the job tougher, said Senator Ben Cardin, a senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\u201cAnd closing the border - that makes no sense at all,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWe need Mexico\u2019s cooperation to work with us, and cutting off the border just tells Mexico: \u2018We\u2019re doing it alone\u2019.\u201d\nReporting by Dave Graham in Mexico City; Additional reporting by Sharay Angulo in Mexico City and Lesley Wroughton, Doina Chiacu and Patricia Zengerle in Washington; Editing by Grant McCool and James Dalgleish Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and may not reflect those of Kitco Metals Inc.

The proposal would also require those banks to publicly report how much of that debt they have outstanding.\nRegulators finalized rules requiring the additional debt at the end of 2016. The proposed changes are open for public comment for 60 days after they are formally published.\nReporting by Pete Schroeder; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Susan Thomas Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and may not reflect those of Kitco Metals Inc.

Rates remained stable in the other 33 countries.\nOf the 71 countries assessed for prostate cancer death rates, there were decreases in 14, increases in three, and no change in 54.\nAs of 2012, prostate cancer was the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men in 96 countries and the leading cause of death in 51 countries, according to the study.\nFreeman said the findings confirm the benefits of prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) screening. She noted that in the United States, incidence rates rose from the 1980s to the early 1990s, then declined from the mid-2000s through 2015, largely due to increased use of PSA screening.\nThis type of screening is less available in poorer nations, meaning that men there are more likely to be diagnosed at later stages of prostate cancer and more likely to die, Freeman said.\nShe noted that some nations plan to scale back recommendations for PSA screening due to fears about possible overtreatment of prostate cancer that would never cause symptoms.\nDr. Eric Horwitz, professor of medicine at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, said this line of thinking is \"potentially problematic.\"\nContinued The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men aged 55 to 69 undergo periodic screening after they've discussed the risks and benefits with their doctor.\n\"The screening recommendations were changed recently after further analysis of the U.S. data and we are now seeing more high-risk prostate cancer diagnoses that require treatment,\" said Horwitz, who wasn't involved with the study.\nFreeman said future studies should monitor trends in mortality rates and late-stage disease to assess the impact of reduction in PSA testing in several countries.\nThe study was to be presented Tuesday at the AACR annual meeting, in Atlanta.

Phillip / AP Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 2, 2019, 5:10 PM GMT By Associated Press One morning last fall, 4-year-old Joey Wilcox woke up with the left side of his face drooping. It was the first sign of an unfolding nightmare. Three days later, Joey was in a hospital intensive care unit, unable to move his arms or legs or sit up. Spinal taps and other tests failed to find a cause. Doctors worried he was about to lose the ability to breathe. Search for the unknown: The rise of AFM, the puzzling, polio-like condition Dec. 7, 2018 09:16 \u201cIt\u2019s devastating,\u201d said his father, Jeremy Wilcox, of Herndon, Virginia. \u201cYour healthy child can catch a cold \u2014 and then become paralyzed.\u201d Joey, who survived but still suffers some of the effects, was one of 228 confirmed victims in the U.S. last year of acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM , a rare, mysterious and sometimes deadly paralyzing illness that seems to ebb and flow on an every-other-year cycle and is beginning to alarm public health officials because it is striking more and more children. Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it may bear similarities to polio, which smoldered among humans for centuries before it exploded into fearsome epidemics in the 19th and 20th centuries. Fauci, who published a report about the disease Tuesday in the journal mBio, said it is unlikely AFM will become as bad as polio, which struck tens of thousands of U.S. children annually before a vaccine became available in the 1950s. But he warned: \u201cDon\u2019t assume that it\u2019s going to stay at a couple of hundred cases every other year.\u201d Related CDC report finds link between enterovirus D68 and polio-like condition While other countries have reported cases, including Canada, France, Britain and Norway, the size and pattern of the U.S. outbreaks have been more pronounced. More than 550 Americans have been struck this decade. The oldest was 32. More than 90 percent were children, most around 4, 5 or 6 years old. Most had a cold-like illness and fever, seemed to get over it, then descended into paralysis. In some cases it started in small ways \u2014 for example, a thumb that suddenly wouldn\u2019t move. Some went on to lose the ability to eat or draw breath. Many families say their children have regained at least some movement in affected limbs, but stories of complete recovery are unusual. Health officials cannot say how many recovered completely, partly or not at all, or how many have died, though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says deaths are rare. Scientists suspect the illness is being caused chiefly by a certain virus that was identified more than 55 years ago and may have mutated to become more dangerous. But they have yet to prove that. And while doctors have deployed a number of treatments singly or in combination \u2014 steroids, antiviral medications, antibiotics, a blood-cleansing process \u2014 the CDC says there is no clear evidence they work. Many parents say that when they first brought their child to the emergency room, they quickly realized to their horror that the doctors were at sea, too. Related What is acute flaccid myelitis? \u201cEveryone is desperate for some magical thing,\u201d said Rachel Scott, a Tomball, Texas, woman whose son Braden developed AFM in 2016 and has recovered somewhat after intensive physical therapy but still cannot move his right arm and has trouble swallowing and moving his neck. A growing number of experts agree that physical therapy makes a difference. \u201cThese kids can continue to recover very slowly, year over year. ... It\u2019s driven by how much therapy they do,\u201d said Dr. Benjamin Greenberg of UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, one of the nation\u2019s foremost experts on the condition. Wilcox, Joey\u2019s father, said his son made huge improvements that way. Joey can run and use his arms. Still, muscle tone is weak in his right leg and shoulder, and he still has left-side facial paralysis. \u201cHe can\u2019t completely smile,\u201d his dad said. Other stories are more tragic. Katie Bustamante\u2019s son Alex developed AFM in 2016. The suburban Sacramento, California, mother realized something was wrong when she asked the boy, then 5, why he wasn\u2019t eating his yogurt. Alex replied that his thumb had stopped working and he couldn\u2019t hold his spoon. That morning was the start of 17 months of hospital stays, surgeries, therapy, and struggles with doctors and insurers to find a way to restore his ability to breathe. It ended one morning last May, when the Bustamantes woke up to find Alex had died. Government officials need to step up, Bustamante said. \u201cI want them to research it and find the cause, and I want them to find a way to prevent it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is growing. This shouldn\u2019t be happening.\u201d More and more experts feel certain the main culprit is an enterovirus called EV-D68, based on the way waves of AFM have coincided with spikes of respiratory illnesses caused by EVD-68. Enteroviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which, such as polio, can damage the central nervous system, while many others cause mild symptoms or none at all. In the U.S., doctors began reporting respiratory illnesses tied to EV-D68 in 1987, though usually no more than a dozen in any given year. Then, in what may have been one of the first signs of the AFM waves to come, a 5-year-old boy in New Hampshire died in 2008 after developing neck tenderness and fever, then weakened arms and deadened legs. The boy had EVD-68, and in a report published in an obscure medical journal, researchers attributed his death to the virus. The first real burst of AFM cases hit in 2014, when 120 were confirmed, with the largest concentrations in California and Colorado. What ensued was an even-year, odd-year pattern: Cases dropped to 22 in 2015, jumped to 149 in 2016, and fell again, to 35 in 2017. Last year they reached 228, a number that may grow because scores of illnesses are still being investigated. In keeping with the cyclical pattern, just four cases have been confirmed this year so far. CDC officials consider an illness AFM based on scans and other evidence showing a certain kind of damage to the spinal cord. Proof of an enterovirus infection is not required for a case to be counted, mainly because such evidence has been hard to come by. So far, CDC investigators have been able to find evidence of enteroviruses in the spinal fluid of only four of 558 confirmed cases. Scientists are using more sensitive spinal-fluid tests in hopes of establishing the connection between AFM and EV-D68 more firmly. That, in turn, could spur more focused work on treatments and maybe even a vaccine. Meanwhile, Fauci\u2019s agency has put out a call for researchers to apply for federal funds, and is tapping a University of Alabama-anchored network of pediatric research centers to work on the illness. The CDC is pledging a greater focus, too. Parents have accused the agency of doing little more than counting cases and have complained that when they tried to contact CDC, they encountered only automated phone trees and form responses. CDC officials have begun holding meetings and calls with families, set up a scientific task force and working to monitor cases more closely. Fauci suggested it would be a mistake to assume that surges will take place every other year forever. The next one \u201cmay be in 2019, for all we know,\u201d he said.

The US is at an inflexion point in a years-long standoff with Turkey, a NATO ally, after failing to sway President Tayyip Erdogan that buying a Russian air defence system would compromise the security of F-35 aircraft. On Monday, the Pentagon said it had suspended the delivery of equipment related to the stealthy F-35 fighter jet \"pending an unequivocal Turkish decision to forgo delivery of the S-400\".\nThe tough step came after months of warnings from Washington that Turkey's adoption of Russian missile technology alongside US fighter jets would pose a threat to the F-35 technology and endanger Western defences. Unusual NATO member move\nThe purchase of a Russian system is highly unusual for a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Western alliance forged to counter the Soviet Union. 190401201937194\nThe US suspension announcement came two days before foreign ministers from NATO's 29 members were due in Washington to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the alliance.\nLast week, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu met in Turkey with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, and insisted that the S-400 purchase would go ahead.\nBut on Monday, Shanahan expressed optimism that the US and Turkey would find a way out of the crisis by persuading Turkey to buy the Patriot defence system, instead of S-400s.\n\"I expect we'll solve the problem so that they have the right defence equipment in terms of Patriots and F-35s,\" Shanahan told reporters at the Pentagon.\nShanahan added that he expected the US to ultimately carry out the delivery of F-35s currently at Luke Air Force base to Turkey, after resolving the dispute. Turkish pilots are receiving training on two aircraft at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona.\nThe disagreement over the F-35 is the latest of a series of diplomatic disputes between the United States and Turkey including Turkish demands that the US extradite preacher and businessman Fethullah Gulen , differences over Middle East policy and the war in Syria .\nSOURCE: News agencies", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick shanahan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "turkey news | al jazeera turkey pentagon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "us defence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us defense", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T20:23:06.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "33739671703d509fb9b2c4d2412a7b3e3fe7d060", "url": "https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/n-s-to-adopt-presumed-consent-for-organ-donations-under-new-legislation-1.4362281", "site_full": "atlantic.ctvnews.ca", "site": "ctvnews.ca", "site_section": "http://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/rss/Atlantic", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CTV News Atlantic -

HIV-positive patients can receive transplants from HIV-negative donors just like anyone else.\nOnly in the last few years, spurred by some pioneering operations in South Africa, have doctors begun transplanting organs from deceased donors with HIV into patients who also have the virus, organs that once would have been thrown away.\nSince 2016, 116 such kidney and liver transplants have been performed in the U.S. as part of a research study, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, or UNOS, which oversees the transplant system. One question is whether receiving an organ from someone with a different strain of HIV than their own poses any risks, but so far there have been no safety problems, said UNOS chief medical officer Dr. David Klassen.\nHopkins' Segev said Monday's kidney transplant was a world first. Doctors had hesitated to allow people still living with HIV to donate because of concern that their remaining kidney would be at risk of damage from the virus or older medications used to treat it.\nBut newer anti-HIV medications are safer and more effective, Segev said. His team recently studied the kidney health of 40,000 HIV-positive people and concluded that those with well-controlled HIV and no other kidney-harming ailments like high blood pressure should face the same risks from living donation as someone without HIV.\n\"There are potentially tens of thousands of people living with HIV right now who could be living kidney donors,\" said Segev, who has advised some other hospitals considering the approach.\nGenerally, kidneys from living donors last longer, added Dr. Niraj Desai, the Hopkins surgeon caring for the recipient. And if more people living with HIV wind up donating, it helps more than HIV-positive patients who need a kidney.\n\"That's one less person waiting for a limited resource,\" Desai said. \"That helps everybody on the list.\"\nMartinez, a public health consultant, became interested in living donation even before HIV-to-HIV transplants began. Then last summer she learned that an HIV-positive friend needed a transplant, and tracked down Segev to ask if she could donate.\nHer friend died before Martinez finished the required health tests but she decided to honour him by donating to someone she didn't know.\nA runner who plans on making this fall's Marine Corps Marathon, \"I knew I was probably just as healthy as someone not living with HIV who was being evaluated as a kidney donor,\" Martinez said. \"I've never been surer of anything.\"\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Just months earlier in April, another E. coli outbreak linked to romaine had sickened more than 200 and killed five. That was later linked to an irrigation canal near a massive cattle lot in Arizona; the fall outbreak was linked to a water reservoir in California. In both cases, regulators never confirmed how the water became contaminated.\nThough the FDA has publicly called on the leafy greens industry to step up safety, the emails offer a stark view of the agency's longstanding frustrations with continued outbreaks. They also show how the agency leveraged the crisis to pressure for voluntary changes, even as it tries to figure out its own water testing rules.\nIn a statement, the FDA said it has been working with growers and state agencies to improve safety since the outbreaks, including testing of romaine. The agency said new regulations that include farm inspections and sanitary rules for workers also should help stem outbreaks.\nIndustry groups said they're expanding existing safety practices for their members. Joining the industry agreements is voluntary, however, and a farm linked to the fall outbreak was not a member.\nFood poisoning outbreaks tied to leafy greens have been an ongoing concern for health officials. The failure of industry measures to stop outbreaks shows the lack of a clear solution, and even regulators aren't sure how to fix the problem, said Timothy Lytton, a food safety expert at Georgia State University.\nThis month, the FDA delayed a regulation requiring produce growers to test water for E. coli -- which is how the leafy greens industry has been monitoring its water. The presence of E. coli doesn't necessarily make people sick, but can signal potentially harmful strains. The agency said it needs more time to consider whether it's the most practical option.\n\"That's essentially just stepping back and asking industry to take responsibility for public safety,\" said Sarah Sorscher of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.\nGorny's emails came during the fall outbreak tied to California growing regions. In a message in late November, he noted additional, recent illnesses with a strain similar to the earlier spring outbreak.\nThe FDA said it never tied those additional illnesses to a food. But at the time, Gorny called it a \"near miss\" that shows the problem wasn't fixed.\nSorscher said the lack of a solution is concerning, but lettuce is still a healthy food and the \"odds are very good that you won't get sick.\"\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

During an interview with TMZ , Saget voiced vague support for his TV relative, who, along with husband Mossimo Giannulli, is accused of paying $500,000 so that daughters Olivia Jade and Isabella would be admitted to USC as rowing recruits, despite not being athletes. Saget, who said he wasn't in the habit of doing man-on-the-street interviews, wouldn't say whether Loughlin thought she deserved jail time if convicted. But he did echo what co-star Candace Cameron Bure said earlier this month. \"I just love who I love,\" Saget told the gossip site. \"Candace said it really good at the Kids\u2019 Choice Awards : \"You love who you love,\" he said, adding, \"Life\u2019s complicated. I don\u2019t like talking about it.\" Though Cameron Bure didn't mention Loughlin by name at the award show Saturday, her speech was interpreted as a response to Loughlin's legal problems. \"A loving family sticks together no matter what,\u201d she said. \"They stick together through the hard times, they support each other, they encourage one another, they pray for each other and they stand by their side, no matter how tough it gets.\" John Stamos, who was out with Saget when TMZ caught them, said he isn't ready to publicly comment on his TV wife's predicament. \"I will at some point,\" he promised. \"I'm just not ready yet.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.tmz.com/2019/03/29/bob-saget-john-stamos-lori-loughlin-complicated-college-scandal/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2019/03/24/fuller-house-cast-talks-family-after-lori-loughlin-college-scandal/3261279002/&quot;", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2019/03/24/fuller-house-cast-talks-family-after-lori-loughlin-college-scandal/3261279002/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2019/03/25/olivia-jade-sister-isabella-giannulli-lori-loughlin-enrolled-usc/3271841002/&quot;", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2019/03/12/felicity-huffman-lori-loughlin-why-they-under-arrest/3140329002/&quot;", "https://www.tmz.com/2019/03/29/bob-saget-john-stamos-lori-loughlin-complicated-college-scandal/&quot;", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2019/03/25/olivia-jade-sister-isabella-giannulli-lori-loughlin-enrolled-usc/3271841002/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2019/03/12/felicity-huffman-lori-loughlin-why-they-under-arrest/3140329002/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bob saget", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lori loughlin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sara m mon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "olivia jade", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saget", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cameron bure", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isabella", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "candace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "candace cameron bure", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "loughlin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mossimo giannulli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T20:52:20.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d63c06b13e6d7e879ad4d6137856280f09a6be7a", "url": "https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/power/sjvnl-appoints-s-p-bansal-as-new-director-civil/68692177", "site_full": "energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "business", "green_solutions"], "section_title": "", "title": "SJVNL: SJVNL appoints S P Bansal as new Director-Civil, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld", "title_full": "SJVNL: SJVNL appoints S P Bansal as new Director-Civil, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-68692177,imgsize-117137,width-800,height-434,overlay-etenergyworld/sjvnl-appoints-s-p-bansal-as-new-director-civil.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d63c06b13e6d7e879ad4d6137856280f09a6be7a", "url": "https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/power/sjvnl-appoints-s-p-bansal-as-new-director-civil/68692177", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "SJVNL: SJVNL appoints S P Bansal as new Director-Civil, Energy News, ET EnergyWorld", "text": "People movement SJVNL appoints S P Bansal as new Director-Civil Prior to joining SJVN, Bansal was the Chairman & Managing Director of Hindustan Salts Limited ETEnergyWorld | April 02, 2019, 20:16 IST Newsletter A A New Delhi: Public sector hydro power major Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam ( SJVNL ) today announced it has appointed Surinder Pal Bansal as the new Director-Civil of the company.

Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP President Trump says he will close the United States' Southern border, or large sections of it, next week if Mexico does not immediately stop illegal immigration. Here Trump speaks to reporters during a visit to Lake Okeechobee and Herbert Hoover Dike at Canal Point, Fla., on Friday.\nManuel Balce Ceneta/AP Updated at 5:13 p.m. ET\nPresident Trump's call to cut aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras is raising concerns among lawmakers and national security and development experts, who say cutting aid will exacerbate the migrant crisis that is already crippling U.S. resources at the Southern border.\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Agency for International Development told NPR on Tuesday that the agency is carrying out the president's order to end foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle, the area that comprises those three Central American nations. The spokesperson said the agency is still finalizing the allocation of funds for 2019.\nTrump has blamed the Central American countries for sending migrant caravans through Mexico to the U.S. border, an idea Trump has repeatedly promoted to raise the alarm about illegal immigration. In tweets on Saturday, Trump also returned to his previous threat to completely seal off the Southern border, blaming Democrats and Mexico for the turmoil at the border.\nNational With Thousands Of Migrants Crossing The Border Daily, We Asked 'Why Now?' In an interview on CNN on Sunday, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney defended the administration's decision to stop aid, claiming U.S. funding to Central America isn't doing enough to stifle the recent spike in migrants coming from the region.\n\"The people say it's working, but the proof is in the numbers. It's not working well enough to help us solve our border crisis, and that's what the president is focused on,\" Mulvaney said. \"And if we're going to give these countries hundreds of millions of dollars, we would like them to do more.\"\nThe U.S. has allocated $2.1 billion in aid to Central America since 2016, according to a report this year by the Congressional Research Service. Aid to Central America greatly increased under the Obama administration to promote economic prosperity and reduce violence in the region, with the idea being that achieving those two goals would mean fewer people would need to flee to the United States.\nFormer Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson says that this investment is \"beginning to show positive signs.\"\n\"Suspending aid to Central America, as President Trump has threatened to do, in my judgment, is the exact wrong thing to do,\" he told Morning Edition .\nMuch of the appropriated funding isn't sent directly to governments. Instead, it is sent to nonprofits and nongovernmental organizations that are working to deal with the root causes of migration, according to NPR international correspondent Carrie Kahn, who's based in Mexico City. The funds have supported efforts such as strengthening police forces, border security and judicial systems, as well as gang prevention and food security programs.\nAid groups worry that suddenly slashing funds will have big repercussions, according to Ken Baker, CEO of Glasswing, a nonprofit group working in Central America.\n\"One of the things that has been talked about is how, you know, that [these countries] aren't doing enough. But they really do work with us,\" Baker says. \"They do work with the U.S. government. It is in their interests.\"\nNational Immigration System At The 'Breaking Point,' Homeland Security Official Warns Many experts say it's too soon to determine whether those programs are working, but in El Salvador, officials have praised the country's cooperation with the U.S. for dramatically reducing migration. The number of Salvadorans detained at the U.S. border dropped by more than half, down from nearly 72,000 in 2016 to more than 31,000 in 2018, according to U.S. Border Patrol data .\n\"The decision to cut funding contradicts the results of what we have accomplished together,\" Ra\u00fal L\u00f3pez, El Salvador's vice minister of justice, said Monday. \"The fact is that migration from El Salvador is declining, thanks to our work.\"\nThe U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, a nonprofit that supports diplomacy in the U.S., found that in areas where the U.S. Agency for International Development worked in El Salvador, the homicide rate dropped by 45 percent on average from 2015 to 2017.\nWhen homicides spike, so does migration. For every 10 murders in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, six children leave for the United States.\nLiz Schrayer, president of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, told Here & Now's Robin Young that more work needs to be done in the region to hold these countries accountable and to support active diplomacy. But she warns that without aid programs, the migrant crisis will worsen.\n\"One thing we should not be doing is pulling out our aid programs. If we do that, it's only going to exacerbate the unrest,\" she says. \"People will leave if the violence continues, if they don't have economic opportunities and if they can't put food on their table.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "herbert hoover dike", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manuel balce", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "npr", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ap photo/manuel balce ceneta", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fla.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canal point", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el salvador", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guatemala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "honduras", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lake okeechobee", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T21:30:48.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bceb30a1ab8c268d0d9fcfe1c0c0c0f1490611f7", "url": "http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg248333.html?Open", "site_full": "www.redbooks.ibm.com", "site": "ibm.com", "site_section": "http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/rss/all.xml", "site_categories": ["tech", "business"], "section_title": "IBM Redbooks | Just Published", "title": "IBM Spectrum Archive Enterprise Edition V1.3.0: Installation and Configuration Guide", "title_full": "IBM Spectrum Archive Enterprise Edition V1.3.0: Installation and Configuration Guide", "published": "2019-04-01T16:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 682, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 5}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bceb30a1ab8c268d0d9fcfe1c0c0c0f1490611f7", "url": "http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg248333.html?Open", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-01T16:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "IBM Spectrum Archive Enterprise Edition V1.3.0: Installation and Configuration Guide", "text": "Authors: Larry Coyne, Khanh Ngo, Illarion Borisevich Abstract\nThis IBM\u00ae Redbooks\u00ae publication helps you with the planning, installation, and configuration of the new IBM Spectrum\u2122 Archive Enterprise Edition v1.3.0 for the IBM TS3310, IBM TS3500, IBM TS4300, and IBM TS4500 tape libraries. IBM Spectrum Archive\u2122 EE enables the use of LTFS for the policy management of tape as a storage tier in an IBM Spectrum Scale\u2122 based environment. It helps encourage the use of tape as a critical tier in the storage environment. This is the seventh edition of IBM Spectrum Archive Installation and Configuration Guide.\nIBM Spectrum Archive EE can run any application that is designed for disk files on a physical tape media. IBM Spectrum Archive EE supports the IBM Linear Tape-Open (LTO) Ultrium 8, 7, 6, and 5 tape drives in IBM TS3310, TS3500, TS4300, and TS4500 tape libraries. In addition, IBM TS1160, TS1155, TS1150, and TS1140 tape drives are supported in TS3500 and TS4500 tape library configurations.\nIBM Spectrum Archive EE can play a major role in reducing the cost of storage for data that does not need the access performance of primary disk. The use of IBM Spectrum Archive EE to replace disks with physical tape in tier 2 and tier 3 storage can improve data access over other storage solutions because it improves efficiency and streamlines management for files on tape. IBM Spectrum Archive EE simplifies the use of tape by making it transparent to the user and manageable by the administrator under a single infrastructure.\nThis publication is intended for anyone who wants to understand more about IBM Spectrum Archive EE planning and implementation. This book is suitable for IBM clients, IBM Business Partners, IBM specialist sales representatives, and technical specialists. Table of contents\nChapter 1.

If this political sabotage of our health care system succeeds, Americans would face skyrocketing health care and prescription drug costs and two million people in Wisconsin with a pre-existing condition would have their guaranteed protections wiped away,\u201d \u201cI was branded as a child with the words, \u2018pre-existing condition,\u2019 so I have worked to make sure that no family should have to choose between helping their child get better or going bankrupt. Congressional Republicans have tried to repeal health care coverage for Wisconsin families and now Attorney General Barr has gone to court in support of President Trump\u2019s effort to take away guaranteed protections and raise costs for Americans with pre-existing conditions. The people of Wisconsin did not send me to Washington to take people\u2019s health care away and I will continue my fight against these relentless attacks on our health care system that would make things worse for Wisconsin families.\u201d\nThe resolution introduced by all 47 Senate Democrats today outlines the dire consequences for hardworking American families of this politically-motivated action and proclaims the DOJ\u2019s decision must be reversed.\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s assault on Americans\u2019 health care cannot go unanswered, which is why today I\u2019m introducing a resolution that calls on the Department of Justice to reverse its position in the Texas v. United States lawsuit. Ensuring the health and safety of the American people should transcend politics. I am urging Republicans to support this resolution and work with Democrats to fix our health care law \u2013 not repeal it,\u201d said Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH). \u201cCongressional Republicans have a choice here \u2013 sit idly by while the president strips their constituents of their health care coverage, or work with Democrats to protect Americans\u2019 care and improve the system.\u201d\n\u201cThe Trump administration has doubled down on its assault on American health care by supporting an effort to completely eliminate our health care law through the courts\u2014sending health care costs soaring for millions of Americans and revoking affordable coverage for tens of millions more,\u201d said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). \u201cThe consequences of this politically-motivated decision are dire, and that is why we call on all senators who proclaim to be in favor of pre-existing condition protections to join us in supporting this resolution to reverse the DOJ\u2019s misguided and cruel decision.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tammy baldwin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "barr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeanne shaheen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reed o\u2019connor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "save pre-existing condition protections and health care", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. district court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doj", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T22:00:34.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2f58a04343ebddd1ad8c4f3c4ac7ed0752221548", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/sen87chima", "site_full": "twitcasting.tv", "site": "twitcasting.tv", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["television", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "\u306f\u306a@\u6d41\u8840\u4eba 5/17\u3084\u3068\u00d7\u308c\u304f\u767a\u58f2\uff01 (@sen87chima) 's Live - TwitCasting", "title_full": "\u306f\u306a@\u6d41\u8840\u4eba 5/17\u3084\u3068\u00d7\u308c\u304f\u767a\u58f2\uff01 (@sen87chima) 's Live - TwitCasting", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://imagegw03.twitcasting.tv/image3/image.twitcasting.tv/image77_1/29/34/1ff33429-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2374, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2f58a04343ebddd1ad8c4f3c4ac7ed0752221548", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/sen87chima", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "\u306f\u306a@\u6d41\u8840\u4eba 5/17\u3084\u3068\u00d7\u308c\u304f\u767a\u58f2\uff01 (@sen87chima) 's Live - TwitCasting", "text": "Title of work being infringed Details\nI read and understand the following notes and send this form.

He cautioned that the president has not made any final decisions.\n\"We are watching it and looking for ways to allow the freight passage, some people call it truck roads, and there are ways you can do that which would ameliorate the breakdown in supply chains,\" Kudlow told CNBC's Sara Eisen Tuesday.\nKudlow, who until joining the Trump administration was a CNBC contributor, said he supported Trump's immigration policies \"fully.\"\n\"The question is: Can we deal with that, and not have economic damage? And I think the answer is: We can, and people are looking at different options.\"\n\"Particularly if you can keep those freight lanes, truck lanes, open, that's probably the nub of it,\" Kudlow said.\nKudlow said that allowing workers to cross the border could be more difficult.\n\"I don't want to comment on it because we are playing right now \u2014 what you want to do is stop the emergency and the breakdown, and you want to try to limit whatever harm that does,\" he said. \"It's a very difficult task. I think it's doable.\"\nTrump, who has declared the border situation a national emergency, threatened Friday to shut down \"the Border, or large sections of the Border,\" if Mexico does not \"immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug (sic) our Southern Border.\"\nThe president's threat raised some concerns in the business community.\n\"U.S. trade with Mexico exceeds $1.7 billion daily, and nearly half a million people legally cross the southern border every day as workers, students, shoppers, and tourists,\" said Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in a statement .\n\"Even threatening to close the border to legitimate commerce and travel creates a degree of economic uncertainty that risks compromising the very gains in growth and productivity that policies of the Trump Administration have helped achieve,\" Bradley said.\nThe potential closure also alarmed lawmakers in the president's party, though some suggested that the president's threat was a negotiating tactic.\n\"It's part of the way he negotiates, but I'm not sure that's a particularly good idea and I'm not sure it gets the desired result,\" said Majority Whip Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., according to Politico .\nThe president's threats come as he seeks congressional approval for a trade deal to replace the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement. Securing that deal, which the president refers to as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and which his Democratic critics call NAFTA 2.0, could give the president an important policy win ahead of the 2020 presidential election.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kudlow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larry kudlow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sara eisen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national economic council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T22:05:54.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "359b0d96698c9e15e947fab311e3a41f7807b0c6", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/02/ibm-ceo-ginni-romettys-solution-to-closing-the-skills-gap-in-america.html", "site_full": "www.cnbc.com", "site": "cnbc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "IBM CEO Ginni Rometty's solution to closing the skills gap in America", "title_full": "IBM CEO Ginni Rometty's solution to closing the skills gap in America", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2019/04/02/105828871-1554230962033nup_186484_2293.1910x1000.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 767, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 158, "comments": 97, "shares": 134}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "359b0d96698c9e15e947fab311e3a41f7807b0c6", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/02/ibm-ceo-ginni-romettys-solution-to-closing-the-skills-gap-in-america.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lori Ioannou", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "IBM CEO Ginni Rometty's solution to closing the skills gap in America", "text": "Cindy Ord | CNBC Ginni Rometty\nIBM's Chair, CEO and President Ginni Rometty has a powerful message for workers and employers in all strata of society: The Fourth Industrial Revolution is underway and it is shaping up to be one of the most significant challenges and opportunities of our lifetime. We are already seeing jobs, policies, industries and entire economies shifting as our digital and physical worlds merge.\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, the value of digital transformations in the Fourth Industrial Revolution is estimated at $100 trillion in the next 10 years alone , across all sectors, industries and geographies.\n\"As a result, we face an imminent and profound transformation of the workforce over the next five to 10 years as analytics and artificial intelligence change job roles at companies in all industries,\" Rometty said while giving a keynote address at the CNBC's At Work Talent & HR: Building the Workforce of the Future Conference in New York on Tuesday, April 2. In February, the executive was appointed to Trump's American Workforce Policy Advisory Board along with 24 other leaders.\nWhile only a minority of jobs will disappear, the majority of roles that remain will require people to work with the aid of analytics and some form of AI and this will require skills training on a large scale, Rometty said.\n\"I expect AI to change 100 percent of jobs within the next five to 10 years,\" the IBM CEO said.\nRometty's call to action comes at a time when the AI skills gap and the future of work exhibit a growing sense of urgency. The technology sector accounts for 10 percent of U.S. GDP and is the fastest part of the American economy but there are not enough skilled workers to fill the 500,000 open high-tech jobs in the U.S., according to the Consumer Technology Association's Future of Work survey. Yet the tech industry is concerned that school systems and universities have not moved fast enough to adjust their curriculum to delve more into data science and machine learning. As a result, companies will struggle to fill jobs in software development, data analytics and engineering.\n\"To get ready for this paradigm shift companies have to focus on three things: retraining, hiring workers that don't necessarily have a four-year college degree and rethinking how their pool of recruits may fit new job roles,\" Rometty said.\nTo address the issue IBM is investing $1 billion in initiatives like apprenticeships to train workers for what it calls \"new collar\" jobs \u2013 a phrase Rometty has coined for workers who have technology skills but not a four-year college degree. She noted the company is crafting 500 apprenticeships with the goal of making this \"an inclusive era for employees.\"\nThe \"new collar\" jobs could range from working at a call center to developing apps or becoming a cyber-analyst at IBM after going through a P-TECH (Pathways in Technology Early College High School) program, which takes six years starting with high school and an associate's degree. IBM is also helping to catalyze a national movement to close the skills gap. IBM and the Consumer Technology Association announced the launch of the CTA Apprenticeship Coalition, to create thousands of new apprenticeships in 20 states in January.\nIt provides frameworks for more than 15 different apprenticeship roles in fast-growing fields, including software engineering, data science and analytics, cybersecurity, mainframe system administration, creative design and program management. New apprenticeships will be modeled in large part on IBM's successful apprenticeship program, which launched in 2017, is registered with the United States Department of Labor and has grown nearly twice as fast as expected.\nThe apprenticeships created by this Coalition provide pathways to tech jobs in all parts of the country \u2014 from Kansas to Minnesota to Louisiana \u2014 not just in traditional tech hubs on the coasts. Its goal is to widen the aperture when it comes to hiring by placing the focus on skills rather than specific degrees. From early-career professionals to mid-career transitions and everything in between, these apprenticeships represent a new pathway to success in 21st century careers, including the growing number of new collar roles where a traditional bachelor's degree is not always required. They also offer an opportunity to build in-demand skills without taking on student debt.\nBesides IBM, coalition members include Canon, Ford, Sprint, Toyota and Walmart.\nIn this tight job market, where the talent chase has become so intense, Rometty has some advice for employers at businesses of all sizes. It's a shift in thinking she has adopted at IBM. \"Bring consumerism into the HR model. Get rid of self service, and using AI and data analytics personalize ways to retrain, promote and engage employees. Also move away from centers of excellence to solution centers.\"\nAs she sums it up: \"In today's world company's need to be agile and realize their workforce is a strategic renewable asset. \" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ginni rometty", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rometty", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc ginni rometty ibm", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ibm", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "american workforce policy advisory board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world economic forum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T22:08:01.090+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "843b421322f1270b7aa5f4a4a74557f2f4e85663", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2424498517", "site_full": "www.goodreads.com", "site": "goodreads.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["books_and_literature", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "Pollo (Lima, Peru)\u2019s review of Obras Completas Y Otros Cuentos", "title_full": "Pollo (Lima, Peru)\u2019s review of Obras Completas Y Otros Cuentos", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.063, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 300, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "843b421322f1270b7aa5f4a4a74557f2f4e85663", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2424498517", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Augusto Monterroso", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Pollo (Lima, Peru)\u2019s review of Obras Completas Y Otros Cuentos", "text": "photo Flag Abuse Flagging a post will send it to the Goodreads Customer Care team for review.

Remarkably, he was able to return to football by Week 7 and ended up playing eight games, recording five defended passes and three interceptions, tied with rookie safety Justin Reid for the team-high.\nThe Ed Block Courage Award winner for 2018 retires having made 69 appearances for the Texans since 2014, with 12 interceptions and 31 defended passes to his name. His biggest legacy, however, will no doubt be his outstanding courage and determination while fighting through his illness to achieve a comeback few could have managed, at a level even fewer could have imagined.\nWith his retirement, this does open the door for the Texans to look more seriously into either trading for a safety, or more likely drafting in another this year. With Justin Reid slated to be a starter alongside Tashaun Gipson the Texans suddenly look very thin at the position with little depth behind them.

The expected result of shifting to overseas is seen in our estimates, but don\u2019t think for a second that demand for the Model 3 has fallen.\nWe believe the cheapest Model 3 will begin to steal would-be sales from vehicles like the Chevy Bolt , Nissan LEAF e-Plus , Hyundai Kona Electric and Kia Niro EV . But that\u2019s in the longer outlook. The current and continued near-term focus is Europe and China.\nIf you\u2019ve been following the sales reports from overseas, then you\u2019re already well aware of the fact that the Model 3 has taken the European continent by storm and has left China short of car carriers.\nGlobally, we predict 70,000 to 75,000 total deliveries of S/X/3. We are confident about the North America/Europe combined numbers, but this figure might go even higher depending on China deliveries in March.\nTesla Model 3 Deliveries In U.S. Our estimates show that Tesla . That\u2019s hugely up compared to the 5,750 we estimated for February and 6,500 we estimated for January and it blows away the year-over-year figure from March 2018 ( 3,820 Model 3 estimated sales in U.S. ).\n\u00a9 Provided by The Motorsport Network Solid Black Model X Looks Clean on ADV.1 Advanced Series Wheels Moving on to the Tesla Model S and Model X For March, we estimate the following for U.S. sales of these two Teslas:\nNeither of these figures is especially weak or strong for a March month. For example, in March 2018, Tesla sold 3,375 Model S and 2,825 Model X. Meanwhile, in February 2019, Tesla sold an estimated 800 Model S and 1,100 Model X, so there\u2019s quite an uptick from last month, but not a dramatic year-over-year change.\nSales Boom Ahead? What does the future hold for Tesla in regards to the introduction of the base Model 3? Numbers\u2026BIG numbers. Stay tuned to see the sales boom in the coming months.

The most recent came over the weekend, and the threat was subsequently backed by White House officials so this one carries a bit more weight. The president has repeatedly cited illegal immigration as a major threat to the U.S., but several reports suggest closing the Mexico - U.S. border would have a significant and near-instantaneous effect on the U.S. economy \u2013 including the auto industry.\nFord Could Face Massive Layoffs Over Trump's Tariffs\nTariffs Could Cost The VW Group Up To $2.8 Billion, Says CEO\nA CNN report says the U.S. auto industry would last a week before shutting down if the southern border was closed. The news outlet cites Kristen Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor, and economics from the Center for Automotive Research, who explained that just about every vehicle in America has parts sourced from Mexico. The report goes on to say approximately 16 percent of all auto parts in the U.S. \u2013 used both at manufacturing plants and auto parts stores \u2013 are imported from Mexico.\nAdditionally, the report cites a statement from Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council (AAPC), who reportedly said that \u201cany action that stops commerce at the border would be harmful to the U.S. economy, and in particular, the auto industry. Access to Mexico's marketplace and North American integration are critical to operations in the U.S .\" Motor1.com has reached out to the AAPC for confirmation on that statement.\nTrump Administration Argues Better Gas Mileage Leads To More Deaths\nBye Bye BMW, Donald Trump Wants To Ban German Car Imports To US\nTrump is often critical of the news coverage from CNN, but other outlets report the same dire consequences a southern border shutdown could have on the U.S. auto industry. NPR also turned to Dziczek for information, who further explained that Mexico accounts for 37 percent of all imported parts in the States and that a border closure could see some manufacturing plants go idle in just a few hours.\nAccording to CNN, several Trump administration members told the news outlet that the president has been warned about the economic consequences of a border shutdown.\nCNN , NPR", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.motor1.com/news/269269/ford-massive-layoffs-trump-tariffs/?utm_source=msn.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=msn-feed", "https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/02/business/border-closing-us-auto-industry-shutdown/index.html?utm_source=msn.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=msn-feed", "https://www.motor1.com/tag/donald%20trump/?utm_source=msn.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=msn-feed", "https://www.motor1.com/news/243632/donald-trump-german-car-ban/?utm_source=msn.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=msn-feed", "https://www.motor1.com/news/306597/vw-profits-at-risk-tariffs/?utm_source=msn.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=msn-feed", "https://www.motor1.com/", "https://www.npr.org/2019/04/02/708999622/southern-border-closure-would-have-consequences-for-u-s-economy?utm_source=msn.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=msn-feed", "https://www.motor1.com/news/260862/fuel-economy-regulation-epa-proposal/?utm_source=msn.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=msn-feed"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christopher sm", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "srt subaru suzuki tesla toyota volkswagen volvo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitsubishi nissan oldsmobile plymouth pontiac porsche ram rolls-royce saab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "motor1.com donald trump research make", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cadillac", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T22:41:29.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d92a6f458ef3b45f20be5c56c89c68953b7f0638", "url": "http://en.freshnewsasia.com/index.php/en/internationalnews/13578-2019-04-01-10-18-26.html", "site_full": "en.freshnewsasia.com", "site": "freshnewsasia.com", "site_section": "http://en.freshnewsasia.com/index.php?format=feed&type=rss", "site_categories": ["tennis", "sports", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "FRESH NEWS", "title": "U.S. Military Osprey Makes Emergency Landing at Airport in Western Japan", "title_full": "U.S. Military Osprey Makes Emergency Landing at Airport in Western Japan", "published": "2019-04-01T20:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://image.freshnewsasia.com/2019/007/fn-2019-04-01-17-18-19-0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6016, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d92a6f458ef3b45f20be5c56c89c68953b7f0638", "url": "http://en.freshnewsasia.com/index.php/en/internationalnews/13578-2019-04-01-10-18-26.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-01T20:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "U.S. Military Osprey Makes Emergency Landing at Airport in Western Japan", "text": " U.S. Military Osprey Makes Emergency Landing at Airport in Western Japan Hits: 284 - 03/04/19 02:40 Hits: 284\nTOKYO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. military Osprey aircraft made an emergency landing at Osaka International Airport in western Japan on Monday afternoon, the Japanese Defense Ministry said.\nThe tilt-rotor aircraft was en route to Naval Air Facility Atsugi in Kanagawa Prefecture, south of Tokyo, from the Marine Corp Air Station Iwakuni in the western prefecture of Yamaguchi.\nAccording to officials from both the land ministry and the airport, also known as Itami Airport, the emergency landing has not affected commercial flights.\nThe officials also said there have been no reports of injuries as a result of the emergency landing.\nThe exact cause of the Osprey's emergency landing is still under investigation, the officials said.\nThe accident-prone tilt-rotor aircraft, which can take off and land like a helicopter and fly like a fixed-winged plane, have concerned citizens across Japan due to its checkered safety history since its design phase.\nA U.S. Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey made an emergency landing in Japan's Oita Prefecture, on the eastern coast of Kyushu, in August 2017, while a similar plane made a crash-landing off Nago in Okinawa in December 2016.\nThe turboprop plane was also involved in a fatal crash off the coast of Australia in August 2017 that killed three personnel aboard.

An unredacted version of one letter viewed by Reuters identified the recipient as Diamond Foundry, a California company that makes laboratory diamonds. Diamond Foundry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe agency said that it had found instances in which the eight companies advertised diamond jewelry \"without clearly and conspicuously disclosing that the diamonds are laboratory-created,\" according to the letter.\nAnalysts say increased production of laboratory-grown diamonds will lower the price of the stones. Diamond Producers Association (DPA), which represents mining companies like De Beers, Rio Tinto RIO.L and Alrosa ALRS.MM , welcomed the FTC insistence that companies distinguish between diamonds that are mined and those that are made in laboratories.\n\"The DPA has for several months expressed serious concerns about misleading marketing communication and unsubstantiated eco claims coming from many laboratory grown diamond marketers,\" said DPA Chief Executive Jean-Marc Lieberherr.\nDe Beers, a unit of Anglo American AAL.L , said it was pleased by the move, saying the two kinds of diamonds were \"distinct product categories.\"\nDe Beers has responded to pressure from lab diamonds by tearing up its decades-old policy of only selling natural diamonds in jewelry and beginning to sell synthetic stones. It sells the lab-made diamonds for less than rivals to emphasize the difference between what it sees as fun, fashion jewelry and natural diamonds created in the earth and with a high re-sale value.\nSince it began selling synthetic gems as jewelry it said the cost of synthetic's stones has plunged.\nThe FTC, in its letters, also asked the companies to review the use of \"eco-friendly\" or similar terms to describe diamonds made in a laboratory. \"It is highly unlikely that they can substantiate all reasonable interpretations of these claims,\" the FTC said in its release.\nThe first lab-made diamond was made in 1955 and larger crystals were made in 1970, but the first synthetic diamonds for purchase were not made until 1970s, according to Dr. James Shigley, research fellow at the Gemological Institute of America.\n\"These lab grown diamonds are diamonds. They have the same physical and chemical properties. We're not talking about an imitation,\" he said, noting that many diamonds are sold for grinding or other industrial purposes.\nU.S. govt warns ads for lab-grown diamonds must be crystal clear", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fau.investing.com%2Fnews%2Fstock-market-news%2Fus-govt-warns-ads-for-labgrown-diamonds-must-be-crystal-clear-1420678&title=U.S.+govt+warns+ads+for+lab-grown+diamonds+must+be+crystal+clear+&summary=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=179222828858436&u=https%3A%2F%2Fau.investing.com%2Fnews%2Fstock-market-news%2Fus-govt-warns-ads-for-labgrown-diamonds-must-be-crystal-clear-1420678&display=popup&ref=plugin", "https://invst.ly/af-d9"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barba", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "diane bartz", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters \u00a9 reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "diamond producers association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ftc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dpa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diamond foundry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. federal trade commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T22:45:22.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "173ff12b71632dad97b904fd516619c2911fbc0e", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/ame_crescent", "site_full": "twitcasting.tv", "site": "twitcasting.tv", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["television", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "\u30df\u30ab\u30c5\u30ad\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3 (@ame_crescent) 's Live - TwitCasting", "title_full": "\u30df\u30ab\u30c5\u30ad\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3 (@ame_crescent) 's Live - TwitCasting", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://imagegw03.twitcasting.tv/image3/image.twitcasting.tv/image75_1/e3/3f/1ff33fe3-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2374, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "173ff12b71632dad97b904fd516619c2911fbc0e", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/ame_crescent", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "\u30df\u30ab\u30c5\u30ad\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3 (@ame_crescent) 's Live - TwitCasting", "text": "Title of work being infringed Details\nI read and understand the following notes and send this form.

Non-citizens comprise about 7 percent of the 328.7 million people living in the United States. Census questionnaires have not included a citizenship question since 1950.\nThe Supreme Court is reviewing a Jan. 15 ruling by U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan that Ross broke a \"veritable smorgasbord\" of federal rules by adding the question, a decision he called \"arbitrary and capricious.\"\nFurman also said the Voting Rights Act was as a \"pretextual\" rationale for adding the question, a decision that Ross had \"already made for other reasons.\"\nThe judge said the change would cause many states to lose federal funding, while Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas would lose congressional seats.\nFurman, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, stopped short of a finding that Ross intended to discriminate against immigrants.\nOral arguments at the Supreme Court are scheduled for April 23.\nSteven Dillingham, who became director of the U.S. Census Bureau in January, declined to discuss Trump's tweet but said the bureau was focused on obtaining a full, complete count.\nHe spoke to reporters at a press briefing on Monday, one year before National Census Day marking the 2020 count.\n'LONG PEDIGREE'\nFurman's decision came in a lawsuit brought by 18 U.S. states, 15 cities and a variety of civil rights groups.\nIn urging the Supreme Court to overturn Furman's ruling, Solicitor General Noel Francisco, representing the Justice Department, said Ross had discretion to add the citizenship question, and that there was a \"long pedigree\" in the census for asking about citizenship or country of birth.\nHe also said other democracies including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Indonesia, Ireland, Mexico, Spain and the United Kingdom ask about citizenship on their censuses.\nAnother federal judge, Richard Seeborg in San Francisco, on March 6 also declared the citizenship question illegal.\nFollowing that ruling, the Supreme Court said it will also decide whether Ross' actions violated the Constitution's Enumeration Clause, which sets out terms for counting people.\nAdding the citizenship question could lead to an undercount of 4.2 million Hispanics alone, the Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy estimated last month.\n(Reporting by Susan Heavey and Lauren Tara LaCapra in Washington, and Nick Brown and Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Susan Thomas and Bill Trott)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jonathan stempel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "susan heavey", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wilbur ross", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commerce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington/new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T22:48:30.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3dcff341a2881cfe88791213a62d8d283e0cc49b", "url": "https://za.investing.com/news/commodities-news/preciousgold-firms-as-us-stocks-retreat-strong-dollar-caps-gains-1441225", "site_full": "za.investing.com", "site": "investing.com", "site_section": "https://za.investing.com/", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Investing.com South Africa - Financial News &amp; Stock Quotes", "title": "PRECIOUS-Gold firms as U.S. stocks retreat; strong dollar caps gains By Reuters", "title_full": "PRECIOUS-Gold firms as U.S. stocks retreat; strong dollar caps gains By Reuters", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.987, "main_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC920S1_L.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 699, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3dcff341a2881cfe88791213a62d8d283e0cc49b", "url": "https://za.investing.com/news/commodities-news/preciousgold-firms-as-us-stocks-retreat-strong-dollar-caps-gains-1441225", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Reuters", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "PRECIOUS-Gold firms as U.S. stocks retreat; strong dollar caps gains By Reuters", "text": "\u00a9 Reuters.

Investing.com - U.S. crude hit fresh 2019 highs on Tuesday on a mixture of renewed optimism about the economic outlook and the ongoing effects of falling output from OPEC countries.\nNew York-traded West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained 5 cents, or 0.5%, at $61.87 a barrel by 7:58 AM ET (11:58 GMT). It had topped the $62-mark earlier on Tuesday for the first time since last November.\nMeanwhile, Brent crude futures , the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., slipped 4 cents, or 0.1%, to $68.97, pulling back from an intraday high of $69.50.\nBetter-than-expected readings of manufacturing activity in the U.S. and China released this week eased concerns that a slowing global economy might require less oil.\nA Reuters survey released Monday showed that OPEC's crude output fell nearly 300,000 barrels a day to a four-year low in March. Saudi Arabia led the charge by cutting more production than promised, while power outages in Venezuela restricted the loading of export shipments.\nMarkets took Tuesday\u2019s news that Russia fell short of its oil-output cut target for March in their stride.

Not only had the team been fighting for pay equality via lawsuitssince their World Cup win in 2015, but it just so happened to be International Women's Day when news of the latest suit broke. Whether the timing was intentional or not,the team sent a clear message \u2014 the defaulted response that \"men are better to watch\" is no longer good enough. They are good enough, and they aren't about to settle for anything less than what they deserve.\nWhile the previous battle focused mostly on their paychecks, the women's national team is now expanding their grievances to include everyday discrimination. From whether or not they play on artificial turf or grass, to how often they play, and the medical attention they receive, the team is ready to address all levels of inequity that affect their game.\nFor Megan Rapinoe, forward and co-captain of the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team, these discrepancies have been part of her career from the very beginning. \"Traveling overseas, sitting in economy and knowing knowing the men always travel overseas and they fly first class, the different hotels, [and the fact] that we stay in playing on turf all the time [are some examples],\" she tells Bustle at a press event for Nike where the latest Word Cup jersey kits were revealed. \"We don't anymore because we actually had to cancel a game because the turf was so bad.\"\nShe says on top of the obvious pay discrepancies, the team's fight against injustices is aboutreading between the lines and looking to see if games are being invested in equally, how much marketing and promotion there is of games, and how many women have brand sponsorships compared to the men. When making those comparisons, the women's teams were still coming up woefully short, and it's perpetuating a notion that not investing in women's sports is justified.\n\"If you spend 10 times more on promoting the men, they're probably going to be 10 times more successful,\" Rapinoe says. \"So if everything's equal and they're 10 times more successful, then we can have a conversation. [...] But I think that there's just so much potential left on the table with this team because we're not funded equally.\" Courtesy of Nike\nBut the argument that \"women aren't as fun to watch\" is starting to become a moot point. According to the New York Times, the 2015 women's World Cup final was the most watched soccer game in U . S . history \u2014 25.4 million people tuned in to watch the U . S. victory over Japan. But if visibility and viewership is what it takes to achieve equity, there is still a ways to go. The Tucker Center for Research on Girls & Women in Sport found that, though women represent 40 percent of all participants in sports, they only represent four percent of media coverage. Al Jazeera also reports that 99 percent of all sponsorship money goes to men, with Serena Williams being the only female in the top 100 highest-paid athletes in the world.\nBut some brands arestarting to challenge the idea thatsports has to be a male-dominated industry solely targeting male viewership.For example, Nike's most recent \" Dream Crazier \" campaign shines a light on sexist double standards in sports, which does something incredibly unique \u2014 not only is the sports apparel brand marketing directlyto women, they're calling out the difficulties women face within sports. In 2017, Gatorade's \" Sisters In Sweat \" campaignfeatured Serena Williamstalking to her newborn daughter, encouraging her and all women to stay in sports as a source of strength.\n\"You look at branding agencies that are starting to catch on very quickly,\" Rapinoe says. \"You've got a huge share of the market controlled by women, whether because we're the buyers of the house or just that we're half of the population. So why wouldn't you brand directly towards women or cater directly towards women in all of these different ways?\"\nIn Rapinoe's opinion, making women a target audience is just one piece of the puzzle that can push the momentum forward for women's sports overall. The second is to simply show up and spread the word.\n\"Continue to tell people about it and talk about it,\" she says. \"If you are a hater and you've never been to game, then [...] go to the game and just watch. And then if you really truly have watched a number of games, and you hate it, then you don't have come.\"\nAs Rapinoe says, it all boils down to a choice. If the sports industry chooses to champion men's sports over women's by putting money, viewership, and representation behind them, the scales are obviously tipped in their favor. \"You're just choosing one team over another, it's not really about who's popular, and who's not.\"\nBut for Rapinoe, being a female soccer player isn't just an uphill battle to do what she loves on fairer terms. She finds herself at an interesting moment in history where she can spearhead a change not just in this traditional part of American culture, but in cultural attitudes toward women overall.\n\"I think we're at such an incredible moment to be at the forefront of all this and to be able to be leaders in the community and to be able to [...] just stand with the Times Up movement and stand with the Me Too movement, and stand with all these other women fighting to break that glass ceiling and achieve pay equity,\" Rapinoe says. \"It's inspiring to be able to be in proximity of all of that and all of these inspiring women, the people that we've been able to meet along the way and the gains that we've been able to make, it really is a transformational time.\"\nRapinoe says she feels hopeful when looking at her career's trajectory\u2014 things have changed a lot since she first started, and she's proud to be a part of something bigger that was able to engineer that change. And other women in sports are listening. The New York Times reported that after the U.S. women's team went public with their pay discrimination lawsuit, other teams from around the world, often in other sports, reached out to help fight for similar gains. The team has become a leader and an example in the space of what collective bargaining for women can look like, The New York Times states.\nAnd Rapinoe says that though future female athletes will inherent vestiges of these problems, they have opportunities to break similar ground.\n\"[Being a female athlete] is really is an opportunity to do something bigger than yourself, and to [...] move the needle, and in so many ways,\" she says. \"It's very inspiring to see that change happen in the world as you're happening with it.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. soccer star megan rapinoe", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fighting against pay inequality & other discrepancies in her sport u.s. soccer star megan rapinoe", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "united states soccer federation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "courtesy of nike", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T23:12:27.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f56d865851694d89be063a94e74436d92a2af63c", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2769624188", "site_full": "www.goodreads.com", "site": "goodreads.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["books_and_literature", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "Sabine (Germany)\u2019s review of Homo Faber", "title_full": "Sabine (Germany)\u2019s review of Homo Faber", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.027, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 300, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f56d865851694d89be063a94e74436d92a2af63c", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2769624188", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Max Frisch", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Sabine (Germany)\u2019s review of Homo Faber", "text": "photo Flag Abuse Flagging a post will send it to the Goodreads Customer Care team for review.

U.S. Magistrate Judge M. Page Kelley agreed, concluding that McGlashan posed \"some risk of flight.\"\n\"I'm sorry to disappoint the family, but I'm not going to allow the vacation,\" she said.\nMcGlashan, 55, was among 15 parents who on Friday made their initial court appearances before Kelley, who reviewed their bail conditions and warned them to not discuss the case with co-defendants and potential witnesses, including their children.\nOther parents who appeared in court included New York food and beverage distributor Gregory Abbott; Gamal Abdelaziz, the ex-president of Wynn Resorts Ltd's Macau subsidiary; and wealthy media executive Elisabeth Kimmel.\nFifty people, including the actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman, have been charged with participating in the scheme, headed by California college admissions counselling service operator Rick Singer.\nProsecutors said Singer helped parents use bribes and cheating to secure admission for their children to universities including Yale, the University of Southern California and Georgetown University.\nSome $25 million in bribes were paid to coaches who helped Singer's clients secure spots for their children as fake athletic prospects, prosecutors said.\nSinger also facilitated cheating on college entrance exams, prosecutors said. He pleaded guilty on March 12 to charges including racketeering conspiracy and is cooperating with investigators.\nProsecutors alleged McGlashan paid Singer's foundation $50,000 to have an associate correct his son's answers on an ACT college entrance exam at a test centre Singer \"controlled.\"\nMcGlashan also conspired to pay $250,000 in order to bribe a USC official and have his son admitted to the school as a fake football recruit, prosecutors said. McGlashan denies the allegations.\n(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; editing by Chris Reese, Tom Brown and Leslie Adler)\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

Lynch\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General William Barr plans to issue a redacted copy of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's nearly 400-page investigative report into Russian interference in the 2016 election by mid-April, he said in a letter to lawmakers on Friday.\n\"Everyone will soon be able to read it on their own,\" Barr wrote in the letter to the top Democrats and Republicans on the Senate and House Judiciary committees.\nHe said he is willing to appear before both committees to testify about Mueller's report on May 1 and May 2.\nMueller completed his 22-month investigation probe into whether President Donald Trump's campaign colluded with Russia on March 22. On Sunday, Barr sent a four-page letter to Congress summarizing Mueller's findings.\nBarr told lawmakers that Mueller's investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with Russia in its election interference activities.\nMueller left unresolved the question of whether Trump obstructed justice during the investigation. Barr said that based on the evidence presented, he concluded it was not sufficient to charge the president with obstruction.\nLawmakers have since been clamouring for more details, with Democrats calling for a full release of the report. At a rally on Thursday in Michigan celebrated the end of the investigation and what he called \"lies and smears and slander.\"\nBarr said in his letter on Friday that certain information must be redacted before the report is release, including secret grand jury information, intelligence sources and methods and information that by law cannot be public or might infringe on privacy.\nHe said that while Trump has the right to assert executive privilege on some materials, that \"Trump has stated publicly that he intends to defer to me.\" Because of that, he said, there are no plans for the Justice Department to submit the report to the White House for a privilege review.\n(Reporting by Sarah N.

He argued McGlashan could instead vacation domestically, like at his $12 million home in Big Sky, Montana.\nU.S. Magistrate Judge M. Page Kelley sided with Rosen, saying she saw \"some risk of flight\" posed by the former private equity executive's travel plans.\n\"I'm sorry to disappoint the family, but I'm not going to allow the vacation,\" she said.\nMcGlashan, 55, was among 15 parents who on Friday made their initial court appearances before Kelley who reviewed their bail conditions and warned them to not discuss the case with co-defendants and potential witnesses, including their children.\nFifty people, including the actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman, have been charged with participating in the scheme, headed by college admissions counselling service operator Rick Singer.\nProsecutors said the California consultant helped parents use bribes and cheating to illegally secure admission for their children to universities including Yale University, the University of Southern California and Georgetown University.\nSome $25 million in bribes were paid to coaches who helped Singer's clients secure spots for their children as fake athletic prospects, prosecutors said.\nSinger also facilitated cheating on college entrance exams, prosecutors said. He pleaded guilty on March 12 to charges including racketeering conspiracy and is cooperating with investigators.\nProsecutors alleged that McGlashan paid Singer's foundation $50,000 in exchange for having an associate correct his son's answers on an ACT college entrance exam at a test centre that Singer \"controlled.\"\nMcGlashan also conspired to pay $250,000 in order to bribe an official at the University of Southern California and have his son admitted to the school as fake football recruit, prosecutors said.\n(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; editing by Chris Reese and Tom Brown)\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

(Reuters) - President Donald Trump threatened on Friday to close the U.S. border with Mexico to trade if Mexico does not stop immigrants from reaching the United States.\n\"We'll keep it closed for a long time. I'm not playing games. Mexico has to stop it,\" Trump said on a visit to Florida. Asked if he would close the Mexican border to all trade, Trump told reporters: \"It could be to all trade.\"\nTrump has repeatedly vowed to close the U.S. border with Mexico during his two years in office, but this time the government is preparing to follow through as it struggles to deal with a surge of asylum seekers from countries in Central America, many of whom travel through Mexico to the border.\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials warned that commerce with Mexico, the United States' third-largest trading partner, could slow down as the agency shifts 750 border personnel from ports of entry to help process asylum seekers who are turning up between official crossing points.\n\"Make no mistake: Americans may feel effects from this emergency,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement.\nNielsen and other U.S. officials say border patrol officers have been overwhelmed by a dramatic increase in asylum seekers, many of them children and families, fleeing violence and economic hardship in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.\nBorder patrol officers apprehended 66,450 people at the southern border in February, two and a half times the number they apprehended in February 2018.\nIt is not clear how shutting down ports of entry would deter asylum seekers, as they are legally able to request help as soon as they set foot on U.S. soil.\nBut a border shutdown would disrupt tourism and commerce between the United States and Mexico, which totalled $612 billion last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Nielsen warned that the personnel shift would lead to commercial delays and longer wait times at crossing points.\n\"We'd be looking at losses worth billions of dollars,\" said Kurt Honold, head of CCE, a business group in Tijuana, Mexico. \"It's obvious he's not measuring what he says.\"\nTrump is trying to convince Congress to sign off on a revised trade agreement with Mexico and Canada that his administration negotiated last year.\nTrump delivered his latest threat in a series of Twitter posts as at least hundreds of migrants were being held in a chain-link enclosure in El Paso, Texas, a border patrol official saying on Thursday that migrants were crossing at an average of 570 people per day in the area, the highest rate in more than a decade.\n\"Mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the U.S., far greater than Border Costs. If Mexico doesn't immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States through our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week,\" he wrote on Twitter.\nMigrants illegally crossing the U.S. border have led to tension between the United States and Mexico ever since Trump began his bid for the presidency almost four years ago, taking a hard line on immigration and saying Mexico was sending rapists and drug runners into the United States.\nMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Thursday that tackling illegal immigration is an issue chiefly for the United States and the Central American countries to address.\nTrump has so far been unable to convince Congress to tighten asylum laws or fund a proposed border wall that was one of the main platforms of his 2016 election campaign and then his presidency. Trump declared a \"national emergency\" in February to build the wall. Congress has not funded the wall and Trump has said he would use money earmarked for the military to pay for its construction.\n(Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati and Jeff Mason; Additional reporting by David Alexander, Anthony Esposito, Lizbeth Diaz and Andy Sullivan; Writing by Andy Sullivan; Editing by Tim Ahmann and Grant McCool)\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

He did not elaborate and it was not immediately clear with whom he had dined.\nTrump imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports beginning last July in a move to force China to change the way it does business with the rest of the world and to pry open more of its economy to U.S. companies.\nThough his blunt-force use of tariffs has angered many, Trump's push to change what are widely viewed as China's market-distorting trade and subsidy practices has drawn broad support.\nLobbyists, company executives and U.S. lawmakers from both parties have urged Trump not to settle simply for Beijing's offers to make big-ticket purchases from the United States to help reduce a record trade gap.\nLOST IN TRANSLATION?\nDetails of where the two sides made progress were not immediately clear. Going into the talks, people familiar with the negotiations had said there were still significant differences on an enforcement mechanism and the sequence of when and how U.S. tariffs on Chinese products would be lifted.\nMnuchin and Lighthizer greeted a waiting Liu at the Diaoyutai State Guest House just before 9 a.m. (0100 GMT), and in two brief appearances before journalists, the three mingled and joked with members of the opposite teams.\nAnalysts had anticipated the scope of this round of talks, which wrapped up about 24 hours after the U.S. delegation arrived, to be quite narrow, but that both countries hoped to signal they were working hard toward a resolution.\nReuters reported previously that the two sides were negotiating written pacts in six areas: forced technology transfer and cyber theft, intellectual property rights, services, currency, agriculture and non-tariff barriers to trade.\nA U.S. administration official told Reuters earlier this week that Lighthizer and Mnuchin were \"literally sitting there going through the texts\", a task typically delegated to lower-level deputies.\nOne person with knowledge of the talks said \"translation is definitely an issue\", referring to discrepancies between the Chinese- and English-language versions.\nOn Thursday, Premier Li Keqiang said Beijing would sharply expand market access for foreign banks and securities and insurance companies, fuelling speculation that China may soon announce new rules allowing foreign financial firms to increase their presence.\nKudlow said on Thursday the United States may drop some tariffs if a trade deal is reached, while keeping others in place to ensure Beijing's compliance.\n\"We're not going to give up our leverage,\" he told reporters in Washington.\n'THERE ARE GOING TO BE PROBLEMS'\nThere remains scepticism that any deal can permanently resolve U.S.-China trade tensions.\n\"Whatever implementation mechanism China agrees to, whether it is monthly or quarterly meetings or other check-ins, there are going to be problems,\" James Green, a senior adviser at McLarty Associates who until August was the top USTR official at the embassy in Beijing, told Reuters.\n\"Either the purchases are going to be off, or the market access is not going to be there. And then the question is, 'When do you consider putting tariffs back on?'\" he added. \"The trade issue is not going to be put to bed.\"\nTrump's demands include an end to Beijing's practices that Washington says result in the systematic theft of U.S. intellectual property and the forced transfer of American technology to Chinese companies.\nU.S. companies say they are often pressured into handing over technological know-how to Chinese joint venture partners, local officials or regulators as a condition for doing business in China.\nThe U.S. government says technology is often subsequently transferred to, and used by, Chinese competitors.\nThe issue has proved tough for negotiators as U.S. officials say China has previously refused to acknowledge the problem exists to the extent alleged by the United States, making it hard to discuss resolution.\nChina says its laws enshrine no requirements on technology transfers that are a result of legitimate transactions.\n(Reporting by Michael Martina and Philip Wen in Beijing; Additional reporting by Jeff Mason, Tim Ahmann and David Lawder in Washington; Writing by Ben Blanchard, Tony Munroe and David Lawder; Editing by, Clarence Fernandez, Dan Grebler and Bill Berkrot)\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

The Federal Reserve last week brought its three-year campaign to tighten monetary policy to an abrupt end.\nThe U.S. central bank abandoned projections for any interest rate hikes this year after increasing borrowing costs four times in 2018, in a nod to the slowing economy, low inflation and rising headwinds to growth. The economy is losing steam as the stimulus from $1.5 trillion in tax cuts as well as increased government spending dissipates.\n\"Unless some positive shock hits the economy, by the fall, we are likely to be back to where we were before the tax cut bill was passed,\" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, edged up 0.1 percent as households cut back on purchases of motor vehicles. Spending fell 0.6 percent in December.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending increasing 0.3 percent in January. The release of the January consumer spending figures was delayed by a five-week partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25.\nWhen adjusted for inflation, consumer spending gained 0.1 percent in January after dropping 0.6 percent in December.\nThe dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell, while stocks on Wall Street rose.\nWEAK DATA STREAM\nThe weak consumer spending report extended the run of soft data ranging from housing starts to manufacturing that have flagged a sharp slowdown in growth early in the first quarter. The economy's outlook is also being overshadowed by slowing global growth, Washington's trade war with China and uncertainty over Britain's departure from the European Union.\nGross domestic product forecasts for the first quarter are as low as a 0.9 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter after expanding at a brisk 3.4 percent rate in the July-September period.\nBut the Fed's decision to shelve further monetary policy tightening could prop up the interest-rate-sensitive housing market. A second report on Friday from the Commerce Department showed new home sales rose 4.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 667,000 units in February, the highest level since March 2018.\nThe housing market, however, accounts for a small fraction of the economy. A recovery in the sector, which hit a soft patch last year, will probably not be enough to blunt the impact on growth from slowing consumer spending and manufacturing.\nA third report from the University of Michigan showed a rise in consumer sentiment in March. Economists, however, did not expect this to translate into stronger consumer spending as other confidence measures softened during the month.\n\"Spending will downshift to the slowest pace in a year in the first quarter,\" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.\nIn January, spending on goods fell 0.2 percent after dropping 2.4 percent in December. It was the second straight monthly decline in spending on goods and reflected a decrease in motor vehicle purchases.\nOutlays on services rose 0.2 percent as consumers paid more for financial services and insurance, after increasing 0.3 percent in December.\nWith demand softening, inflation pressures were tame in January. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index fell 0.1 percent, reversing December's 0.1 percent gain.\nIn the 12 month through January, the PCE price index rose 1.4 percent, the smallest rise since September 2016 after increasing 1.8 percent in December.\nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index ticked up 0.1 percent in January after rising 0.2 percent in the prior month. That lowered the year-on-year increase in the so-called core PCE price index to 1.8 percent from 2.0 percent in December.\nThe core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. It hit the U.S. central bank's 2 percent inflation target in March last year for the first time since April 2012.\nIn February, personal income increased 0.2 percent after dipping 0.1 percent in January. Incomes have been volatile in recent months because of one-off factors, including government payments to farmers caught in the U.S.-China trade war.\nWages rose 0.3 percent in February, matching January's gain. Savings decreased to $1.19 trillion last month from $1.22 trillion in January.\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci and James Dalgleish)\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

But they are seeking confirmation for this optimism in next week's data, which includes retail sales, manufacturing activity, durable goods orders and non-farm payrolls.\nReports that meet or beat expectations \"would suggest the soft patch we entered the year with is temporary\" and would confirm economic projections for 2019, said Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan.\nFebruary's U.S. retail sales data, due on Monday, and the March jobs report, scheduled for Friday, may be the most closely watched indicators as economists want reassurance on the spending power and confidence of U.S. consumers, which represent about 70 percent of the U.S. economy.\nU.S. non-farm payroll growth almost stalled in February, with only 20,000 jobs created. Economists polled by Reuters last expected an average of 170,000 new jobs for March.\nJanuary retail sales rose a modest 0.2 percent after a December decline, but were not seen as strong enough to alter slowing U.S. economic momentum. Economists, on average, expect a February increase of 0.3 percent.\n\"If we were to witness a faltering of the U.S consumer, that would be very difficult for markets, which are relying on the U.S. consumer to propel the cycle through at least another year,\" said Frances Donald, head of macroeconomic strategy at Manulife in Toronto.\nBut Donald expects a rebound in both retail sales and jobs, since the last reports were weakened by the December-January government shutdown. She will also watch durable goods data, due on Tuesday, for a view on corporate capital spending.\n\"I have less conviction capex will take off markedly, but if we do see an improvement, that would be a substantial surprise,\" said Donald.\nStrong capex would also surprise TD Ameritrade Chief Market Strategist JJ Kinahan, who says companies have stalled spending as they await the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks.\nKinahan says U.S.-China tensions could mute market reactions to data \"unless it's so far off to the upside or the downside.\" The two countries are due to negotiate in Washington, D.C., next week after what Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said were \"constructive\" talks in Beijing this week.\nOptions contracts on the S&P 500 Index and its tracking fund, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, show a modest uptick in the volatility priced into contracts expiring next Friday, compared with other near-term expirations.\n\u201cWe should expect more volatile days,\u201d said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. \u201cProbably the job numbers will be the biggest focus, partly because of February\u2019s miss and partly due to the overall concerns about slower growth.\"\nManufacturing data will also be under close scrutiny on Monday after weak U.S. and German March data last Friday, according to Cresset's Ablin.\nWhile Ameriprise's Price is expecting solid data, he cautions: \"The market has more downside risk than upside risk primarily because of the yield inversion, the concern over the tone of economic data over the past few months, not just in the United States, but around the world.\"\n(Additional reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Dan Grebler)\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

UPDATE 4-Three importers cut Iran oil shipments to zero -U.S. envoy (Updates with minor edits)\nBy Lesley Wroughton and David Brunnstrom\nWASHINGTON, April 2 (Reuters) - Three of eight importers granted waivers by Washington to buy oil from Iran have now cut their shipments to zero, a U.S. official said on Tuesday, adding that improved global oil market conditions would help reduce Iranian crude exports further.\nThe United States reimposed sanctions on Iran after President Donald Trump last May withdrew the country from a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and several world powers, accusing it of supporting terrorism and conflicts in Syria and Yemen.\nWhile the United States has set a goal of completely halting Iran&apos;s oil exports, it granted temporary import waivers to China, India, Greece, Italy, Taiwan, Japan, Turkey and South Korea to ensure low oil prices and no disruption to the global oil market.\nThe Trump administration is currently in consultations with the importers ahead of a May 2 deadline when the waivers expire.\n\"In November, we granted eight oil waivers to avoid a spike in the price of oil. I can confirm today three of those importers are now at zero,\" Brian Hook, the special U.S. envoy for Iran, told reporters.\nHook did not identify the three.\n\"There are better market conditions for us to accelerate our path to zero,\" Hook said. \"We are not looking to grant any waivers or exceptions to our sanctions regime.\"\nHook said U.S. oil sanctions against Iran had removed about 1.5 million barrels of Iranian oil exports from the market since May 2018.\n\"This has denied the regime access to well over $10 billion in (oil) revenue - a loss of at least $30 million a day,\" he said.\nOil prices on Tuesday hit their highest level so far in 2019, with Brent crude approaching $70 a barrel on the prospect that more sanctions against Iran and Venezuelan disruptions could deepen an OPEC-led supply cut. believe the administration is likely to extend the waivers to the remaining five importers to placate top buyers China and India and to decrease the chance of higher oil prices.\nChina, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey are likely to be given waivers that could cap Iran&apos;s crude oil exports at about 1.1 million barrels per day, U.S.-based analysts at Eurasia Group said in January.

It also pledged to build a tool that would allow users to search all current housing ads listed in the United States, regardless of whether the ads were directed at them.\nThe HUD charge said Facebook enabled advertisers to exclude people whom the social network's data classified as parents, non-American-born, non-Christian, or a variety of other interests that closely align with the Fair Housing Act's protected classes.\n\"Facebook is discriminating against people based upon who they are and where they live,\" HUD Secretary Ben Carson said. \"Using a computer to limit a person's housing choices can be just as discriminatory as slamming a door in someone's face.\"\nGROWING DISCONTENT\nCNBC later reported that HUD was also looking into similar ad targeting practices at Twitter and Google, Facebook's main competition for online advertising dollars.\nHUD could not immediately be reached for comment.\nBoth companies vehemently denied allowing discriminatory advertising, but acknowledged that they allow advertisers to target by gender.\nResearchers have told Reuters that gender targeting could potentially be a violation of the Fair Housing Act.\nDiscrimination against transgender individuals was prohibited, Google said.\n\"We've had policies in place for many years that prohibit targeting ads on the basis of sensitive categories,\" Google said in a statement.\nAdvertising practices at Facebook, the world's largest social network with 2.7 billion users and $56 billion in annual revenue, have been in the spotlight for two years amid growing discontent over its approach to privacy and user data.\nNews organization ProPublica reported as far back as 2016 that advertisers could target ads through Facebook based on people's self-reported jobs, even if the job was \"Jew hater.\"\nProPublica later reported that it was able to buy discriminatory housing ads and slip them past Facebook's review process, despite the company's claims it was blocking such ads.\nSince then, Facebook has faced legal pressure over the issue from the National Fair Housing Alliance, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Communications Workers of America, among other groups and individuals.\nThe ACLU welcomed HUD's complaint, saying it would add \"much-needed pressure\" on the company on top of last week's settlement. It encouraged the department to investigate other online ad targeting platforms.\n\"Although the settlement we reached with Facebook will result in removing many of the most troubling of Facebook\u2019s advertising practices, there is more work to be done,\" Galen Sherwin, an ACLU attorney, said in a statement.\nThe civil charge against Facebook follows an investigation by HUD in August when it filed a formal complaint https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_18_085 against Facebook for violating the Fair Housing Act by allowing landlords and home sellers to use its advertising platform to engage in housing discrimination.\nThe charge will be heard by a U.S. law administrative judge who can award damages for harm caused by the discrimination, along with fines and injunctive and other equitable relief.\n(Reporting by Akanksha Rana in Bengaluru and Katie Paul in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Paresh Dave in San Francisco; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty, Bernard Orr and Dan Grebler)\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

That was the clearest sign yet that the Trump administration will need to scale back its initial proposal made more than a year ago to open up nearly all of America's coastal waters to drilling.\n\"We're at step one, not step seven,\" Bernhardt told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, adding the plan had yet to be fully drafted.\n\"The entire planning process is supposed to do this: start out big and winnow down,\" he said.\nThe initial proposal to open up the Atlantic, Pacific and new parts of the Arctic oceans to offshore drilling drew vehement opposition from nearly every coastal state, mainly over environmental concerns relating to potential oil spills.\nBernhardt made the comments at the hearing to confirm him as permanent head of the Interior Department, which oversees more than one-fifth of the U.S. land surface from Alaska to the Gulf of Mexico. The department has been central to Trump's policy of boosting domestic crude oil, natural gas and coal production.\nLawmakers opposed to Bernhardt heading the department say his former work as a lobbyist could present conflicts of interest unless he recuses himself from certain issues because he has represented companies that would benefit from decisions to open more lands to development.\nBernhardt, 49, pressed repeatedly about his past lobbying for oil and mining companies, sought to assure lawmakers he would make efforts to avoid conflicts of interest.\nSeparately on Thursday, two House Democrats sent a letter to Bernhardt saying their committees - Oversight and Reform and Natural Resources - were investigating whether he and other Interior officials were accurately preserving records of their schedule and daily meetings.\nHe has been acting secretary at the department since December, when his predecessor, Ryan Zinke, resigned amid ethics investigations. Like Zinke, Bernhardt is widely seen as a proponent of expanding energy and mining leasing on public acreage.\nDemocratic senators pushed back against his confirmation, citing a New York Times report earlier this month that Bernhardt helped block the release of a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service report. That document, detailing the risks that pesticides pose to endangered species, was one that companies wanted to suppress, the paper said.\n\"So you asked to come to my office to tell me your ethics are unimpeachable, but these brand new documents I just saw make you sound like just another corrupt official,\" said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon. \"Why would you come to my office to lie to me about your ethics?\"\n\"I make decisions based on exactly the same standards on every single thing that comes to my desk,\" Bernhardt responded.\nAsked if he had anything further to say at the end of the hearing, Bernhardt said: \"I certainly didn't lie to the senator.\"\nBernhardt said he was \"actually pretty good at going up against these guys,\" referring to companies.\nA Colorado native, Bernhardt held a series of positions at the Interior Department under former Republican President George W. Bush from 2001 to early 2009, including as solicitor.\nBernhardt, a lawyer, worked for Denver firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck and as a lobbyist representing Noble Energy Inc, Rosemont Copper Co, Sempra Energy, and California's Westlands Water District, among other clients.\nIf approved by the panel, Bernhardt's nomination will advance to the Republican-controlled Senate where he is widely expected to get the nod.\n(Reporting by Nichola Groom; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe, Bernadette Baum and Richard Chang)\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

That added to last week's 9.6 percent plunge after the jury concluded part-way into the trial that there was a causal link between the weedkiller and Hardeman's disease.\nThe steep, steady slide since the first adverse verdict in a Roundup lawsuit in August 2018 has pushed Bayer's value down to about 52 billion euros ($58 billion), which is several billion dollars less than what the drugs and crop chemicals group paid to acquire Monsanto in 2016.\nOn Wednesday, the jury awarded Hardeman $5 million in compensatory and $75 million in punitive damages. Under a 2003 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, punitive damages are generally limited to less than 10 times the compensatory damages award, meaning the current verdict will likely be reduced, said Adam Zimmerman, a law professor at Los Angeles-based Loyola Law School.\nThe trial is only the second of more than 11,200 Roundup lawsuits set to go to trial in the United States.\nIn the first trial, a California man was awarded damages by a jury in state court in August, which were later reduced to $78 million from an original $289 million that Monsanto sought to throw out. The case is on appeal.\nA third Roundup trial, handled by the same plaintiff lawyers who won the August verdict, is scheduled to start in California's Superior Court in Oakland on Thursday.\nIt was brought by California couple Alva and Alberta Pilliod who were diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2011 and 2015 respectively. They allege their decades-long use of Roundup caused their cancers.\nAnalysts at JP Morgan and Liberum said Bayer's stock price shows the market expects an eventual settlement of up to 20 billion euros or 40 billion euros. They said that was overly pessimistic and they expected the final amount to be \"substantially lower\" than that.\n\"Even if Monsanto/Bayer may win some cases, there is great uncertainty about the number of victories and defeats. That is why we expect Bayer to try to settle the remaining cases,\" said Bryan Garnier analyst Jean-Jacques Le Fur.\nPeter Verdult, an analyst at Citigroup, said more focus should be paid to trials later in the year outside of California to better determine settlement estimates. At least two trials are scheduled to take place in St. Louis, Missouri state court this fall.\nHardeman's case was considered a bellwether trial to help determine the range of damages and define settlement options for the more than 760 other federal cases pending in the same court before U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria. Other cases will be heard in state courts.\n\"This verdict does not change the weight of over four decades of extensive science and the conclusions of regulators worldwide that support the safety of our glyphosate-based herbicides and that they are not carcinogenic,\" Bayer said.\nMonsanto's Roundup was the first to contain glyphosate, the world's most widely used weed killer. But it is no longer patent-protected and many other versions are available.\nBayer does not provide sales figures for the product and analysts no longer deem it a major profit driver.\nGenetically modified crops that resist glyphosate's plant-killing effect, however, contribute heavily to earnings at Bayer's agricultural division.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the European Chemicals Agency and other regulators have found that glyphosate is not likely carcinogenic to humans. The World Health Organization's cancer arm in 2015 reached a different conclusion, classifying glyphosate as \"probably carcinogenic to humans.\"\n(Reporting by Ludwig Burger; Additional reporting by Tina Bellon in New York; Editing by Keith Weir and David Gregorio)\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

Perry said the six contained proprietary information for the companies, the names of which have not been released.\nA House of Representatives aide said that previous Part 810 approvals for Saudi Arabia made during the administration of President Barack Obama are available for public perusal.\nLawmakers from both parties have slammed the Trump administration for negotiating a deal while keeping Congress in the dark. They worry that a program without non-proliferation safeguards could eventually lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.\nSaudi Arabia, which wants to build two reactors initially, has pushed back against U.S. limits on enriching uranium and reprocessing spent fuel, both of which are potential paths to a nuclear weapons program.\nConcern grew after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said last year said the kingdom would pursue nuclear weapons if its rival Iran developed them.\nSenator Tim Kaine, a Democrat, asked Perry if any of his approvals were made before or after Oct. 2, 2018, the day that Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post, was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Khashoggi was a resident of Virginia, Kaine's state.\n\"I don't,\" Perry told Kaine. \"I don't want to give you a date specific,\" Perry said before Kaine resumed questioning. Perry told Kaine he would get back to him on the specific timing of the approvals.\nKaine has accused the Trump administration of complicity in covering up Khashoggi's murder. A number of lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have been at odds with the Trump administration over its response to Khashoggi's killing, and a bipartisan group of senators had introduced a bill to impose sanctions on those responsible for his death.\nPerry, responding to another question by Kaine at the hearing, said that since 2017, the Department of Energy has received 65 applications for Part 810 authorisations and approved 37. Perry said nine were for work in the Middle East, six for Saudi Arabia, and two for Jordan. It was not clear where the last one was for.\nPerry said late last year that he had emphasized to Saudi Arabian officials it was important for them to be seen as strong on non-proliferation, but that part of the talks have centred on making sure any nuclear inspections would not be intrusive to sensitive areas in the kingdom.\nSenator Ed Markey, a Democrat, said on Thursday he will introduce a bill to stop the Trump administration from what he called \"bypassing Congress\" on nuclear technology transfer to Saudi Arabia. The legislation, which would mandate that any 810 authorisations are made available to Congress, would face an uphill battle in the Republican-led chamber.\n(Reporting by Timothy Gardner; Editing by Leslie Adler)\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

Thursday's appeal ruling showed that the United States did not stop all subsidies when asked to do so, echoing an earlier finding against the EU.\nThe WTO's Appellate Body, effectively the supreme court of world trade, ruled that the business and occupancy (B&O) tax rate reduction in Washington state had significantly cut Airbus sales in five particularly price-sensitive sales campaigns.\n\"The Appellate Body has now settled this case definitively, confirming our view the U.S. has continued to subsidise Boeing despite WTO rulings to the contrary,\" European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said in a statement.\nThe U.S. Trade Representative's office called the ruling \"a major win for the United States\", since it had found only one illegal subsidy remaining after it had complied with earlier rulings. Boeing said it would support the new decision.\nAny sanctions could broadly target industries beyond aerospace, but the impact of the record trade dispute on Boeing and Airbus themselves has so far been modest.\nAnalysts have long predicted the case would peter out or be settled without a trade war, but the prospect of retaliation is grabbing more attention than before amid global trade tensions.\nCOUNTERMEASURES\nAirbus said Boeing still received a raft of support and urged the United States to negotiate a \"fair-trade environment\" - a settlement proposal that Washington has so far rejected.\nIn a technical point, it said the WTO had resurrected a wider group of U.S. subsidies which could be challenged later.\nBut Boeing said the slate had now been wiped clean of any unlawful subsidies in the United States, except for the Washington-state measure which it agreed would now be amended.\n\"We trust that our example will prompt Airbus and the European Union to immediately bring themselves into full compliance with the substantial rulings against these parties by the WTO,\" Boeing said in a statement.\nIn a parallel ruling last year, the WTO said the European Union had failed to remove illegal subsidies for two airplane programmes, the A350 and the A380 - the world's largest airliner which Airbus has since decided to stop building due to poor sales.\nThat part of the row simmers on as Airbus argues the case against European government loans for the A380 no longer counts because of its plans to shut production. The United States says the partly unpaid loans continue to damage Boeing indirectly.\nThe two sides are now in arbitration to decide the size of any countermeasures, starting with a U.S. request for authorisation to impose $11 billion in sanctions on EU goods.\n(Reporting by Tom Miles and Tim Hepher, editing by Stephanie Nebehay and Toby Chopra)\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

Jet fuel and diesel would be exempt for humanitarian reasons, the sources said.\nThe U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced a ban in early February on the use of its financial system in oil deals with Venezuela after April.\nBut as recently as this week, the U.S. State department has called up foreign firms to say that the scope of the sanctions is wider.\nThe sources said that the State Department made clear that any kind of oil trade, whether it be direct, indirect or barter, would be considered a breach.\nOFAC and the State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\"This is how the United States operates these days. They have written rules and then they call you to explain that there are also unwritten rules that they want you to follow,\" one of the sources said.\nWashington has been using its oil clout more and more. At a major oil event in Houston this month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made a rare appearance and laid out a vision of working with energy firms to isolate Iran and Venezuela.\nVenezuela's overall exports of crude and fuel dropped to 920,000 barrels a day in the first month of sanctions from more than 1.5 million bpd in the prior three months, according to Refinitiv Eikon and state firm PDVSA data.\nRussia, however, remains a staunch supporter of Maduro's government which has plunged Venezuela into an economic and humanitarian crisis.\nIn an escalation of tensions, U.S. President Donald Trump called on Moscow to remove all its soldiers from Venezuela after a Russian military contingent arrived just outside of Caracas, saying \"all options\" were open to make that happen.\nRussia responded on Thursday saying it had sent \"specialists\" to Venezuela under a military cooperation deal.\nThe biggest trading firms, based in Europe, such as Vitol, Gunvor, Mercuria, Trafigura and Glencore account for about 10 percent of global oil trade.\n(Reporting By Julia Payne and Dmitry Zhdannikov in London, Additional reporting by Lesley Wroughton in Washington; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

[L1N21E1A4]\nSeveral Democrats sharply criticized an expanded anti-abortion policy Pompeo outlined on Tuesday, which cuts funding to groups that support abortion rights. \"Your budget and action is devastating to the health of women around the world,\" Frankel said.\n\"Your administration is abortion obsessed,\" she said.\nRepublicans said they backed the policy and several praised Pompeo for his stance.\nPompeo was reluctant to detail the administration's plan and timeline for releasing an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan developed by White House advisers Jason Greenblatt and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law.\nHe said the proposed plan sought to tackle areas of a Middle East conflict that previous U.S. administrations failed to resolve.\n\"Our vision will demonstrate our commitment that we want Palestinians to have a better life as well,\" Pompeo said, adding he hoped the Palestinians would view the United States as a \"fair arbiter.\"\nPompeo was pressed by Democrat Barbara Lee about proposed cuts in funding to African countries. She said Trump sought cuts of 56 percent to Ghana, 33 percent to Ethiopia, 14 percent to Mozambique, 44 percent to South Sudan, and 71 percent to South Africa, mostly in global health funding.\n\"This is after a well-documented track record of controversial statements from the president identifying certain countries as 's-hole' countries, and quite frankly, attitudes towards the continent in general,\" said Lee.\nPompeo pushed back at the criticism, saying the gist of the question was \"in my judgement fundamentally unsound.\"\n(Reporting by Lesley Wroughton and Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Susan Thomas and Peter Cooney)\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

Previous litigation setbacks and a prior jury verdict against the company have sent Bayer shares plunging.\nThe verdict comes roughly a week after the same jury on March 19 found Roundup to have been a \"substantial factor\" in causing Hardeman's cancer, allowing the trial to proceed into a second phase to determine liability and damages. Bayer shares fell more than 12 percent after last week's jury finding.\n(Reporting by Alexandria Sage in San Francisco; Writing by Tina Bellon in New York; Editing by Bill Berkrot)\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

On Sunday, Washington sent Navy and Coast Guard ships through the narrow strait separating the island from the mainland, part of an increase in the frequency of U.S. movement through the strategic waterway to show support for Taipei.\nTsai said mounting pressure from China for Taiwan to accept a \"one country, two systems model\" and its attempts to alter the cross-straits status quo underscored the need for Taiwan to \"increase our self defence and deterrence capabilities.\"\n\"Fortunately ... Taiwan does not stand alone,\" she said. \"The United States' commitment to Taiwan is stronger than ever.\"\nTsai said she felt the process of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan had become less politicized, adding: \"We are able to have frank discussions with the U.S. on the right equipment for Taiwan\u2019s defence and the U.S. is responding positively to our request.\"\nShe said big-ticket defence items would be managed though a special budget and Taiwan's regular defence budget would \"increase based on challenges coming across the strait.\"\nTsai's Pacific tour has come amid heightened tension between Taipei and Beijing, which has stepped up diplomatic and military pressure to assert its sovereignty over Taiwan.\nChina suspects Tsai and her pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party of pushing for the island's formal independence.\nChinese President Xi Jinping said in January that Beijing reserved the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control, but would strive to achieve peaceful \"reunification.\"\nPRESSURE\nBeijing has regularly sent military aircraft and ships to circle the island on drills in the past few years and has heaped pressure on Taiwan internationally, including whittling by down its few remaining diplomatic allies.\nTsai stressed that Taiwan sought positive relations with Beijing, but China needed to talk without preconditions. She said developments in Hong Kong were not encouraging.\n\"One country, two systems will become just one country,\" she said. \"The two systems do not seem to be respected that much. So I think the experience of Hong Kong teaches the Taiwanese a lot.\"\nTsai said earlier this month that Taiwan has sent a request to the United States to buy an unspecified number of F-16s, a move that could add another irritant to Beijing-Washington ties.\nLast week, U.S. China hawk Peter Navarro, director of the White House's Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, wrote in the New York Times that Taiwan may soon buy 108 M-1 tanks.\nTsai, who faces re-election in January, has repeatedly called for international support to defend Taiwan's democracy in the face of China's renewed threats.\nHer Hawaii stopover, a customary practice for Taiwanese presidents, has drawn criticism from Beijing.\nThis week, Republican and Democratic U.S. lawmakers introduced legislation seeking to boost Taiwan ties, which among other things would direct the Pentagon to make efforts to include Taiwan in military training exercises and expresses congressional support for regular U.S. arms sales.\nTsai visited three diplomatic allies in the Pacific, part of an effort to prevent Taiwan's 17 remaining allies from switching allegiance to China. Four of the six Pacific island nations aligned with Taiwan have elections this year.\nOn Monday, Nauru's parliament passed a resolution supporting Taiwan's democracy and opposing Beijing's \"one-China\" policy after Tsai made a speech there. She also visited Palau and the Marshall Islands during her eight-day trip in which she offered support to the agriculture sectors of the island nations.\n(Reporting by David Brunnstrom in Washington; additional reporting by Ben Blanchard and Yimou Lee; Editing by James Dalgleish)\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

The move drew retaliation by countries including China, Canada, Mexico, Turkey and the European Union.\nLittle has been done to reduce excess steel production capacity in China that U.S. producers blame for most of the industry's woes, and without the tariffs, unfairly traded imports would flood back into the U.S. market, the executives said.\n\"Now is not the time to blink,\" U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt told the lawmakers at a hearing on Wednesday. \"Section 232 must continue to be applied to all countries, especially the largest import sources, whether that's a tariff or a hard quota. Even our best allies can be conduits for foreign steel from China or elsewhere.\"\nCanada and Mexico are trying to negotiate a plan to lift U.S. metals tariffs from their products. The Trump administration is demanding quotas to limit import volumes in lieu of tariffs, but Canada and Mexico are resisting.\nEarlier this week, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer made little headway in a meeting to resolve the issue, a Canadian official told Reuters.\n\"There was not a meeting of the minds,\" the official said. \"That of course is an opportunity for the minister to reflect and think about what our next steps are.\"\nOne issue in the negotiations is addressing U.S. concerns about how to prevent Chinese steel from entering the United States duty-free from Canada and Mexico. The Canadian official said Ottawa was willing to work with U.S. authorities to block such imports, but added that Washington had not yet presented convincing evidence that steel was being trans-shipped through Canada.\nCanada and Mexico have retaliated against the U.S. steel tariffs with their own tariffs on U.S. beef, pork and other agricultural products, raising the ire of farm-state lawmakers.\nSeveral Republican U.S. senators are combining forces on legislation to limit Trump's ability to impose tariffs under Section 232 of the Cold War-era Trade Expansion Act of 1962.\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, who represents the farming state of Iowa, on Tuesday said he would lead the effort aimed at restoring Congress' constitutional authority over trade matters. His plan calls for Section 232 tariffs to be limited to a defined period of time unless extended by Congress.\nUnited Steelworkers President Leo Gerard told the steel caucus lawmakers that Canada should be exempted from the Section 232 tariffs because of the high level of cross-border integration and common ownership in the industry. His union represents about 9,000 Canadian steel workers and 50,000 at U.S. mills.\nBut Representative Mike Bost, a Republican whose district saw U.S. Steel restart two blast furnaces and rehire 800 workers at its Granite City, Illinois mill last year, made clear that he was focused on rebuilding steelmaking capacity in the United States, not Canada.\n\"I want to let you know that the focus of this committee should be our U.S. workers,\" Bost said.\nThe steel executives also called on the lawmakers to boost U.S. demand for steel by passing a significant infrastructure investment package this year.\n\"Please let this year be the time to stop talking and start investing,\" said ArcelorMittal USA President John Brett.\n(Reporting by David Lawder and Alexandra Alper, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

Abrams did not provide further details.\nHe had been asked if the United States had seen a change in North Korea's production of nuclear weapons, material and missiles.\nAbrams said that while he had enough intelligence and surveillance resources to deal with the current situation, that might not be the case if relations were to worsen on the Korean peninsula.\n\"If they change negatively then our stance and our posture is not adequate to provide us an unblinking eye to give us early warning and indicators,\" he said.\nThere has been no sign of direct contact between Washington and Pyongyang since the collapse of the Feb. 27-28 summit, though Trump has stressed his good personal relationship with Kim.\nRandall Schriver, the Pentagon's top Asia policy official, said there had be no progress on denuclearization.\n\"Our door is still open for diplomacy, but to date we have not seen movement on denuclearization,\" Schriver said.\nHe added that he was not aware of sanctions being removed or changed since Trump tweeted last week that he had ordered the withdrawal of additional large-scale sanctions on North Korea.\nSeveral American think tanks and South Korean officials reported that satellite imagery showed possible preparations for a launch from the Sohae rocket launch site at Tongchang-ri, North Korea, which has been used in the past to launch satellites.\nThere have also been reports from South Korea\u2019s intelligence service of activity at a factory at Sanumdong near Pyongyang that produced North Korea's first intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States.\nSince then however, South Korea's defense minister has said it was premature to say whether recent activity at some of North Korea's rocket facilities involved preparations for a missile launch.\nAbrams also said that despite a reduction in tensions with North Korea, there had been little to no verifiable changes in its military capabilities.\n\"North Korea's conventional and asymmetric military capabilities along with their continued development of advanced conventional munitions and systems all remains unchecked,\" Abrams said.\nNorth Korea has frozen nuclear and missile testing since 2017, and Trump has pointed to this as a positive outcome from nearly a year of high-level engagement with North Korea.\n(Reporting by Idrees Ali in Washington; Editing by James Dalgleish)\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.\nFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.
