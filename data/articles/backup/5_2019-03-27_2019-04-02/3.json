U.S. manufacturing activity rebounded a bit more than expected last month, according to an industry report released on Monday, while China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly returned to growth for the first time in four months in March, a private business survey showed on Monday. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3 percent to a seven-month high after rallying more than 1 percent in the previous session. \"The trouble with silver linings is that the clouds have yet to lift, even if bets mount on the sunshine behind. So, EM Asia optimism may be measured, not manic,\" said Vishnu Varathan, a senior economist with Mizuho Bank, in a note, referring to China's PMI and U.S. ISM data. Philippine stocks regained some ground after declining 1 percent in the previous session and were Southeast Asia's top gainers. Industrials and financials led the recovery with BDO Unibank Inc and PLDT Inc rising 1.5 percent each. Malaysian shares firmed on the back of financial and telecom stocks. Public Bank Bhd, which had dropped to its lowest in more than a year in the previous session, rose 1.2 percent. Vietnam shares gained as much as 0.8 percent to their highest since March 21. Real estate and financial stocks supported the gains with Vinhomes JSC and Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Foreign Trade of Viet Nam firming 0.8 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. Financial and energy stocks helped the Thai benchmark index gain 0.5 percent. PTT Pcl and Siam Commercial Bank Pcl climbed 0.5 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively. Oil prices rose to fresh 2019 highs, supported by firm Chinese economic data that eased demand concerns, the possibility of more sanctions on Iran and further Venezuelan supply disruptions.

The \u201870s group\u2019s devotees have had a longer time to wait for a reunion than most \u2014 especially in underserved America. It\u2019s been 45 years since the Ian Hunter -led band went separate ways, and exactly that long since they played the United States at all, since a few very short tours where various incarnations of Mott got back together in 2009 and 2013 were limited to Europe. But with an eight-city stateside tour that begins this week, the American faithful are finally getting their very belated chance to be hot to trot to Mott.\nNever mind if the spots on everyone\u2019s faces may no longer be from ripping stars off, at this late date; refreshed youth will be conferred upon all dudes at the door.\nRelated stories\nMott the Hoople to Tour U.S. for First Time Since 1974\nDale Griffin, Mott the Hoople Drummer and Co-Founder, Dies at 67\nBut what took so long? Was it Hunter\u2019s general resistance to nostalgia that kept even European fans waiting for (a mere) 35 years to see Mott in concert again, let alone the near-half-century before Mott came anywhere within a thousand miles of all the way to Memphis again?\n\u201cIt really is basically me going out singing songs that I wrote anyway,\u201d says Hunter, speaking with Variety in a pre-rehearsals phone call, sounding almost nonchalant about the late-breaking nod to fan demand. \u201cMost of it is stuff I wrote, or I had a hand in writing, and I\u2019ve been doing this since \u201969, professionally. But I\u2019ve got to tell you, when they put the Mott intro music on and you walk out there, it\u2019s something very special. And it\u2019s lovely and it\u2019s fun. And as long as it isn\u2019t\u2026\u201d He hesitates. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it all the time, you know. I wouldn\u2019t want to do that, because I like new stuff. But now and again, it\u2019s quite bone-tingling when you hear the intro. And I\u2019m really looking forward to it.\u201d\nAlthough the distinction probably isn\u2019t necessary in most fans\u2019 minds, the group doing this tour is being billed as Mott the Hoople \u201974, because the core lineup consists of Hunter plus two musicians who joined late in Mott\u2019s tenure \u2014 keyboard player Morgan Fisher, who came on in 1973, in time for the group\u2019s most widely well regarded album, \u201cMott,\u201d and Ariel Bender, who came in just in time for their 1974 studio swan song, \u201cThe Hoople.\u201d\nThat latter album is \u201cwhat we\u2019re basing this show around. That, and there was a live album that came out (\u201cMott Live,\u201d also in \u201974); half of it was done in London and half of it was done at the Uris Theater on Broadway. This show is based around those two records.\u201d So what distinguishes the final incarnation of Mott the Hoople from previous ones?\nThe fact that, toward the end, they transitioned from being more of a meat and potatoes \u2014 or, being English, bangers \u2018n\u2019 mash \u2014 sort of group, albeit one that had a very Dylan-influence frontman in Hunter, to one with more of a theatrical bent, which kind of finished up what David Bowie had started when he produced their \u201cAll the Young Dudes\u201d album in \u201972.\n\u201cWe were always a bit that way,\u201d Hunter says of their penchant toward rock mini-musicals toward the end, \u201cbut I mean, this was in the days when you had to have a show. It wasn\u2019t enough to just stand there. You had to have a show as well. We were a bit that way. We were a tad theatrical,\u201d he says with a chuckle.\nFor half a minute, they even got lumped in with glam, or glitter-rock, quite a turnabout from how they\u2019d started circa 1969. \u201cBut before we started, the Who latched onto the mods thing,\u201d Hunter points out. \u201cYou know, anything that would get bums in the seats, basically! So I was thinking, okay, fine. I mean, we looked like brick layers. I never liked to think we actually glammed it. We did dress up, but it wasn\u2019t tinsel and silk and satin. It was more flashy than glam.\u201d\nThere were other reasons beyond prevailing fashions for making a shift. \u201cMick Ralphs had gone, and Luther (Grosvener, who changed his name to Ariel Bender, upon replacing Ralphs as guitarist) really wasn\u2019t a writer. He was also fresh into the band, and as much as he gave to the band \u2014 I mean, Luther basically carried the band live; he was brilliant on stage \u2014 he wasn\u2019t coming up with the material in the studio. And he didn\u2019t quite understand the style of the band. So \u2018The Hoople\u2019 was geared more towards keyboards. I had this thing about putting saxes against cellos, too; other people did it later on, but early on, I did it. Then Morgan Fisher was now in the band. and he\u2019s somewhat of a stalwart piano player, so we naturally geared toward Morgan. And I was fiddling about with this orchestral sort of thing with \u2018Marionette\u2019 and stuff like that.\u201d\nStory continues Grosvenor/Bender, who\u2019d previously kept a low profile in Spooky Tooth and Stealers Wheel, became almost literally a new man upon joining Mott, and not just in fake-name. \u201cIt was the funniest thing with Luther, because before us, he\u2019d been in bands where he was a very tasteful player, and a tasteful writer, too. But when he joined us, and we coined the name Ariel Bender, he walked into this alter ego that was just outrageous. And he hasn\u2019t changed much. Every time he does anything in the Mott area, this is what he does. (Mark) Bosch, my regular guitar player, idolizes his playing. He\u2019s off the wall \u2014 and as a guy, he\u2019s not really changed that much. He\u2019s still running around the stage like a 12\u2013year-old.\u201d\nThat Bender and Fisher were left out of the previous European reunions, which focused on the 1969-72 lineup, was a thorn in Hunter\u2019s side.\n\u201cMainly, it\u2019s important that Luther and Morgan get their shot,\u201d Hunter says. \u201cThey never got it the first couple of times around. And it\u2019s important that they get it, because they kept the whole thing rolling back in \u201874\u201d \u2014 at a time when interest in Mott was peaking more than ever, especially in the UK; it wasn\u2019t lack of popularity that caused the split.\nHe further explains the recent history: \u201cThe original band got together in 2009 in London, and then we did a second lot in 2012, but that was the original band. And sadly, it just seemed that they didn\u2019t want Morgan and they didn\u2019t want Luther to play, which kind of upset the bass player, Pete (Overend Watts), and myself. But they (guitarist Mick Ralphs and organist Verden Allen, presumably) maintained it had to be the original band. So Luther and Morgan came to those gigs, and they were very sporting about it. And I just thought that one of these days when we get a window, we should make it up to \u2018em by following the second half of that band, which was the \u201874 version. We got together for three festivals in Europe last summer, and it worked like a dream, so we thought, why not?\u201d\nA lot has gone down since then to make any other version of the band besides the 1974 edition implausible, anyway. Dale \u201cBuffin\u201d Griffin was only able to make cameo appearances on the earlier UK reunions, where he was replaced by Pretenders drummer Martin Chambers, because of poor health; he died in 2017. Watts passed away in 2017. Ralphs is still around but has had to bow out of Bad Company touring, as well, due to health issues.\nAmid all this happiness for American Mott fans, that ebullience dissipates west of the continental divide. That\u2019s because all eight of the reunion dates are toward the east coast. Fans in California and the other Western states have been determinedly hoping a west coast swing would be added, although a gradual acceptance that this may not come to be has prompted a fair amount of flight bookings. Hunter confirms that they won\u2019t be coming back to the States to hit other parts of the country.\n\u201cWe were already booked in Europe\u201d for the coming months, he says. \u201cThe American side of it was tacked on the front. So we have to leave when we have to leave. There\u2019s nothing planned after this, I\u2019m sorry to say. But nobody got in touch with us on the west coast. Either your promoters didn\u2019t think it would work over there, or\u2026\u201d He trails off. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. But you\u2019ve got to be asked before you go somewhere!\u201d\nAt 79, Hunter continues to be an inveterate tourer as well as solo recording artist, regularly visiting the U.S. with his backing outfit, the Rant Band \u2014 members of whom will augment the original (or semi-original) Mott members on this tour. And he has more solo gigs booked for after the close of Mott the Hoople \u201874.\nAn impending 80 th birthday might make other rock \u2018n\u2019 roll stars think about more extensive time enjoying mechanical royalties from \u201cAll the Way From Memphis\u201d in the countryside. Does he ever ponder calling it a day?\n\u201cWell, no. I mean, I get away with it,\u201d Hunter says. Eventually he concedes that the thought has crossed his mind. \u201cI do think, \u2018Oh, this is it.\u2019\u201d He laughs at himself. \u201cI get to Scotland and I think, \u2018This is it. This is the last time I see all this.\u2019 But I\u2019ve been doing that for the last 20 years, and nothing seems to stop. And what am I going to do anyway? What\u2019s the point in stopping? So, no, I\u2019ve no idea when I\u2019m going to retire. I\u2019m having a great time.\u201d\nThe Mott the Hoople \u201974 U.S. itinerary (some shows, including Cleveland \u2014 of \u201cCleveland Rocks\u201d fame \u2014 and Philadelphia sold out early on):\nApril 1 \u2013 Milwaukee, WI \u2013 Miller High Life Theatre\nApril 2 \u2013 Minneapolis, MN \u2013 First Avenue\nApril 3 \u2013Chicago, IL \u2013 Chicago Theatre\nApril 5 \u2013 Detroit, MI \u2013 The Fillmore\nApril 6 \u2013 Cleveland, OH \u2013 Masonic\nApril 8 \u2013 Glenside, PA \u2013 Keswick Theatre\nApril 9 \u2013 Boston, MA \u2013 Orpheum Theatre\nApril 10 \u2013 New York, NY \u2013 Beacon Theatre\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://variety.com/2016/music/people-news/dale-griffin-matt-the-hoople-drummer-and-co-founder-dies-at-67-1201682390/&quot;", "http://bit.ly/2MGsXik&quot;", "https://variety.com/2019/music/news/mott-the-hoople-reunion-tour-america-1203113935/&quot;", "http://bit.ly/2Bnlwsf&quot;", "http://bit.ly/2Bnlwsf", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/LvtYjcZL4gCTiP4de1jd2A--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/variety.com/cdde176f86d5b776d201289b424ed8e9", "https://variety.com/2019/music/news/mott-the-hoople-reunion-tour-america-1203113935/", "https://pages.email.variety.com/signup/?source=yahoo&quot;", "http://bit.ly/2TqsJ1m", "https://variety.com/t/mott-the-hoople/", "https://variety.com/2016/music/people-news/dale-griffin-matt-the-hoople-drummer-and-co-founder-dies-at-67-1201682390/", "https://variety.com/t/ian-hunter/&quot;", "http://bit.ly/2TqsJ1m&quot;", "https://variety.com/t/mott-the-hoople/&quot;", "https://pages.email.variety.com/signup/?source=yahoo", "https://variety.com/t/ian-hunter/", "http://bit.ly/2MGsXik"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mott", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "ian hunter", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "hunter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dale griffin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T07:37:19.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3630cd1198412b7222bfc396e09b3f470cade41d", "url": "http://video.startribune.com/timelapse-watch-the-final-four-court-installed-at-u-s-bank-stadium/507946522/", "site_full": "video.startribune.com", "site": "startribune.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/Court-GoogleNews", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "\"COURT\" -

Well, thanks to social media, it appears that the two BFFs may have put any drama behind them. Jordyn Woods liked Kylie Jenner's latest Stormi video on Instagram, which has prompted some to wonder whether all is good between the once-tight besties.\nOn April 1, Jenner posted yet another incredibly adorable video of her daughter. In the most recent clip, Stormi could be seen carrying her mini Birkin bag while she walked down the steps, with some help from her pops, Travis Scott. The Life of Kylie star captioned the post, \"she won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let go of that purse \u0111\u009f\u0091\u009b \u0111\u009f\u0098\u0164.\" I feel ya, Stormi, because if I had a mini Birkin bag, I wouldn't be letting go of it either.\nThe video, being as cute as can be, naturally garnered plenty of attention from Jenner's family and fans alike. But, the most interesting engagement of the post happened to come from Woods, aka the reality star's longtime (former?) bestie , who liked the post. At first, it doesn't sound as though this would be anything major. After all, Woods has liked and commented on countless snaps from Jenner in the past, and has been featured in just as many .\nBut, considering the drama concerning Woods, Khlo\u0102\u0160 Kardashian, and Tristan Thompson , which has led to a reported falling-out between Jenner and her best friend , it's definitely interesting to see this kind of positive engagement between the two. While this Instagram like doesn't necessarily indicate that the pair is 100% back to their bestie ways, it does suggest that there's no bad blood, which would definitely be a good thing. Kylie Jenner/Instagram\nIn addition to the IG like suggesting the drama has faded, Jenner recently addressed a rumor that she put the Jordy Lip Kits on sale , telling The New York Times , \"That is just not my character,\" she told the publication, \"I would never do something like that and when I saw it, I was like, thrown back. Jordyn knows I didn't actually put it on sale.\"\nBack in mid-February, sources such as TMZ and Hollywood Unlocked reported that Thompson and Kardashian had split after the basketball player supposedly cheated on the Revenge Body star with Jenner's longtime bestie. (Bustle previously reached out to reps for Woods, Kardashian, and Thompson for comment on the situation, but did not hear back.) Following that news, it was reported by People that Woods had moved out of the Life of Kylie star 's house.\nDuring an appearance on Red Table Talk with Jada Pinkett Smith on March 1, Woods discussed the entire situation , addressing everything from the cheating rumors to her relationship with the Kardashian family. In the interview, she said that there was \"never anything intimate\" that went down between her and the Cleveland Cavaliers player. While she didn't go into detail about the state of her friendship with Jenner , she did say that the two had been in contact since the news of the scandal emerged.\nAccording to Entertainment Tonight , Jenner and Woods' friendship was still on the rocks as of March 6. A source told the publication that they \"have communicated, but not much.\" They went on to say that any sort of reconciliation between them depends on how Kardashian feels about it. \"Kylie is still figuring out where Jordyn fits into her life, and the biggest reason is because Kylie wants to respect her sister, Khloe,\" they told ET, and later continued, \"Kylie loves Jordyn, but she loves her sister, Khloe, more and the future of the friendship is directly associated to Khloe's happiness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWoods' like wasn't the only interesting part of Jenner's Instagram post. Additionally, it was interesting to note that Scott was featured in the video, especially considering the recent cheating accusations surrounding the rapper and Jenner. ( Scott's reps previously denied the rumors , telling Entertainment Tonight in early March , \"Travis Scott vehemently denies he cheated on Kylie. It is not true. He did not cheat.\") Based on his appearance in this clip with his daughter, it would appear that he's still on good terms with his family (and with Jenner, more specifically).\nSo, not only is Jenner's video of Stormi just so adorable, but it's also (possibly) helped shed some light on some of the reality star's most important relationships.

Just as the BFF duo promised, Ariana Grande and Victoria Mon\u0102\u0160t dropped \"Monopoly\" on Monday, April 1. The song touches on topics like female friendship and success, but one lyric in particular has caught many fans' attention. In the post-chorus, both Grande and Mon\u0102\u0160t sing, \"I like women and men,\" and this got a lot of people talkin'. Mon\u0102\u0160t has publicly come out before ; Grande has not. So it's no surprise that the lyric sparked a never-ending stream of tweets regarding Grande's sexual identity. (Bustle reached out to Grande's rep for comment, but did not hear back at the time of publication.)\nSince Grande did not officially label her sexual identity, fans should not, either. And they should respect that if she comes out, it's her choice entirely. Mon\u0102\u0160t, however, has opened up about her sexuality before. \"I want everyone to know that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m single (since people wanna pretend I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not) and make imaginary rules for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she tweeted on Nov. 9, 2018 . \u00e2\u0080\u009cI secretly and respectfully went through a difficult break up this summer but enough is enough. I also like girls. Thank U, Next. Bye.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Two weeks later, she posted , \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter coming out, this thanksgiving coulda went waaaay left!! But she love m how I am and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so happy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe \"I like women and men\" line in \"Monopoly\" could very well be from Mon\u0102\u0160t's perspective. Or it could be from both of their perspectives. Or it could be from someone else's perspective entirely. We may never know the answer, and that is the artists' prerogative.\nGrande has not answered fans' questions regarding her sexual identity and this song, and again, she may never answer said questions. (And again, that is her prerogative .) However, she did respond to Twitter user @fl0w3rbloom's tweet about needing \"I like women and men (yeah)\" inked to their rear end. \"Everyone does,\" replied Grande.\nWhether Grande identifies as bisexual or not, \"Monopoly\" is major; hearing one of the biggest pop stars on the planet and one of the most exciting pop songwriters in the biz sing \u00e2\u0080\u009cI like women and men\" feels significant. \"If Ariana is bisexual and this is her way of coming out then I'm so proud of her,\" wrote Twitter user @betturoffs . \"If it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t then thank you for the bisexual anthem ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am!\"\nUltimately, the most significant thing about \"Monopoly\" is how it's making people feel seen. As Twitter user @nate_grover1 wrote , \"also the bi community gonna start using this song to come out now...ur rlly out here making life easier for everyone huh.\" The response from fans makes it clear that the inclusive nature of the song is resonating in a major way.\nTL; DR: Do not stick labels on people who have not already shared their label journey. Oh, and keep celebrating Ariana Grande and Victoria Mon\u0102\u0160t's wonderful friendship and their glorious collaborations. And enjoy this inclusive anthem for the amazing bop that it is.

Special correspondent Marcia Biggs reports from San Pedro Sula with harrowing stories of the fates of migrants who made it to the U.S., only to be deported. Read the Full Transcript\nJohn Yang:\nAnd, as Nick just mentioned, one of the countries threatened with the aid cuts is Honduras.\nFor years, gang violence and insecurity have forced people to flee their homes, most bound for the United States. Many are caught, and then deported, which can lead to a new set of nightmares.\nWith the support of the Pulitzer Center, special correspondent Marcia Biggs and videographer Julia Galiano-Rios went to Honduras to find out the fate of some of those sent home.\nMarcia Biggs:\nIt's a scene that takes place again and again in this airport parking lot in San Pedro Sula.\n\"I thought I would never see you again,\" weeps this 85-year-old woman.\n\"I promised that I would return one day,\" her grandson says.\nHe's home after five years of living illegally in the United States. His family says he was working construction in Orlando when he was picked up for driving without a license, likely by local cops, and then deported by ICE. The family didn't want to speak on camera. Most of them didn't want to talk to us.\n\"They're laughing at us in the United States,\" one woman told me. Around 500 deportees arrive here every week, and underneath the surface of what should be joyful reunions lies the tough reality of why they're coming home and what they now face.\nAmelia Frank-Vitale:\nIf you're deported from the United States, you're sent on a plane. You are handcuffed at your ankles and your feet with chains, shackled.\nMarcia Biggs:\nAmelia Frank-Vitale is an anthropologist focusing on migration issues, working with the families of deportees. She says most of them are poor and were fleeing gang violence. Deported back to one of the most dangerous cities in the world, they now have nowhere to go.\nAmelia Frank-Vitale:\nIf you have to flee, you can't go another neighborhood controlled by that same group. But you can't go to a neighborhood controlled by any of the rival groups either, because having come from a neighborhood known to be controlled by the first group, you will be automatically suspected of being a spy.\nThey go back to the same situation that they fled.\nMarcia Biggs:\nGiovanni is one of those people. Like so many young men in Honduras, Giovanni says members of a local gang threatened to kill him when he didn't join. He asked us not to use his real name.\n\u201cGiovanni\u201d:\nI would never want to get into a gang, because here, to be in a gang means you have to do whatever they say, rob, kill, kidnap, whatever they order you to do.\nMarcia Biggs:\nSo in the fall of 2017, Giovanni and his cousin left Honduras, intending to cross into the U.S. illegally. He says he tried to make an asylum claim after he was arrested, but had no evidence of the threats on his life, which are necessary to advance a claim.\nHe says he couldn't afford the $10,000 bail, so he sat in detention in Arizona while he waited out the process.\nAfter five months, he can't stand it anymore. He signs a voluntary deportation order and is sent back to Honduras. Within a week of his arrival, he says members of the gang kidnapped him and took him to what's known as a casa loca, Spanish for crazy house, one of the many homes abandoned by those fleeing violence, and now stolen by the gangs.\nGiovanni (through translator):\nThey held me for two or three hours. They already had machetes and everything to cut me into pieces. They wanted to kill me at once. They wanted to kill me because I didn't do what they wanted.\nMarcia Biggs:\nWhat did they do to you?\nGiovanni (through translator):\nHere and here. They were like metal rods. They put a rod through me. This one went in deep. They cut my hands. They burned me. I have several scars on my back where they were hitting me. They had a machete that they were going to use to cut my hands. They wanted to cut off my hands and kill me slowly.\nMarcia Biggs:\nAnd what was going through your mind?\nGiovanni (through translator):\nYou can't think about anything, but how to escape, HOW to convince them not to kill you.\nMarcia Biggs:\nAt the last moment, police burst in. They'd been called by his mother. She's still too frightened to show her face.\nHow did you know that you could trust the police?\nWoman (through translator):\nI didn't exactly trust them, but it was my only solution.\nMarcia Biggs:\nThe family says the wounds were still fresh when Giovanni fled again to the U.S. a year ago, but that time he says no one even asked him if he wanted asylum, and he was deported.\nWhen you left the U.S. the last time, were you worried that something would happen when you come back?\nGiovanni (through translator):\nYes, yes. I didn't want to get off the plane.\nMarcia Biggs:\nThe threats came almost immediately, and Giovanni and his family have moved three times in the last year. They're now in hiding, rarely leaving this small alleyway.\nSeveral of their neighbors are making plans to leave on the next caravan, fleeing poverty and extortion by local gangs.\nBut for another family, it's too late. Sara Espinal is every bit the proud matriarch, showing off the photographs and graduation certificates of her children and grandchildren. \"These are my treasures, my most valuable things,\" she says. \"My family is the best thing I have. I am nobody without them.\"\nBut underneath the pride lies the pain of a mother in grief. It's only been one month since Sara lost her son Nelson, gunned down on his own street, in a neighborhood of Tegucigalpa controlled by gangs.\nSara Espinal (through translator):\nI wanted to die with him that day. I couldn't see my son with all that blood. It's too hard for one person.\nMarcia Biggs:\nHis family remembers him as a dedicated brother and uncle, a good neighbor, who spent his last days paving the main road in their village. They say he refused to join a gang and was working in construction. He dreamed of someday opening a barbershop with his sister Patricia, and was hoping to find work in the U.S.\nHe was special.\nWhat were his dreams for his life in the United States?\nPatricia Espinal (through translator):\nHe said: \"I am going to work hard. My idea is not to be there for a long time. I'm going to work as much as I can. And I'm going to send money. We're going to start a business,\" he said. \"We're going to start a family business.\"\nMarcia Biggs:\nLast October, he and a friend from the neighborhood headed north, but were caught at the U.S. border. Unable to make a case for asylum, they were deported.\nNelson's story is like so many horrible ones that we have heard. He was deported from the U.S. and had only been home for one week when his family says he walked out of his house from here, down to the corner, where three men approached him and, without saying a word, shot and killed him.\nPatricia Espinal (through translator):\nIt was something I can't describe, a horrible pain in my chest. I never imagined that we were going to spend such a short time with him and we wouldn't see him again.\nMarcia Biggs:\nAll they have left of Nelson are photos and a few of his personal items. They keep his shoes, neatly arranged in a closet. He also left a 7-year-old son, who plays with his cousins on the same street where his father was brutally murdered.\nPatricia Espinal (through translator):\nPassing through there generates so much pain, and, at the same time, fear, because, when you pass, you think, so anyone can die how he died.\nMarcia Biggs:\nDo you think he knew someone was after him?\nPatricia Espinal (through translator):\nI think he knew. He didn't tell us directly, \"They're going to kill me,\" but he always said, \"I can't do anything here. All there is this danger.\"\nMarcia Biggs:\nLike so many relatives of those killed by gangs in Honduras, Patricia knows who killed Nelson. But not only can she not say who did it. It's clear she doesn't even want us to ask.\nPatricia Espinal (through translator):\nThis is an everyday thing, what you experience in these neighborhoods, and we have had to adapt. Of course, we never thought that it would happen to a family like ours.\nMarcia Biggs:\nBack in San Pedro Sula, we got some bad news from Giovanni.\nHis family have been receiving some threatening messages from the gang that was after him. So, we're going to go find out what is going on.\nGiovanni doesn't have a phone, so the messages were sent to his cousin, an ominous voice cackling and taunting him, calling him a dog, threatening to kill him and his family, and claiming to know where they are.\nIs there anywhere that you can look for protection?\nGiovanni (through translator):\nOnly in a different country, not in Honduras.\nMarcia Biggs:\nDo you ever remember a time when you didn't live in fear?\nGiovanni (through translator):\nI have always had fear of being here. Traveling to another country, facing risk, that, I'm not afraid of.\nAmelia Frank-Vitale:\nNow he's been deported twice, the asylum \u2014 an asylum claim would be harder to make. His life here is absolutely under threat. Sooner or later, they're going to kill that boy. But what option does he have for international protection, really, at this point?\nMarcia Biggs:\nAgainst the odds, Giovanni sets off, packing a tiny bag. Afraid of being robbed, he's got just one change of clothes and a toothbrush.\nHe has a last meal before a tearful goodbye with his brothers and sisters. He's nervous and sad to leave his family, but says he's confident he won't be sent back. He knows the route better and he won't even bother trying to cross legally.\nThe bus comes quickly and, in an instant, he's gone, speeding off to an unknown future and hoping he won't have to return to a country that can't protect him.\nFor the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Marcia Biggs in San Pedro Sula, Honduras.\nJohn Yang:\nAnd an update to Marcia's report.\nAt the end of it, you saw Giovanni leaving Honduras, but he never made it to the United States. The journey proved too difficult and too cold through the late winter, and his fear of being attacked again materialized in Northern Mexico, causing him to turn back near the border. Last week, he returned home to his family in San Pedro Sula.

Believing in equal pay for equal work, LUNA Bar is giving each of the 23 women named to the 2019 USWNT World Cup team $31,250, comprising the difference between the women\u2019s and men\u2019s World Cup roster bonus.\nIn 2016, the players of the USWNT made history when they demanded equal pay. Their fight continues today, as several inequalities remain, such as the World Cup roster bonus awarded to any U.S. soccer player, woman or man, named to the World Cup team. In 2019, each USWNT player was set to receive $31,250 LESS than their counterparts on the men\u2019s team\u2014until now. LUNA Bar has partnered with the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team Player\u2019s Association (USWNTPA) to make its donation directly to each of the 23 players.\n\u201cWhen LUNA Bar approached us in January to support and recognize the USWNT players in this way, I was speechless,\u201d said USWNTPA Executive Director Becca Roux. \u201cMany brands raising awareness for equal pay use the USWNT\u2019s fight as an example, but don\u2019t go the extra step to offer a solution to the problem. LUNA Bar has a long history of supporting women\u2019s equality and is truly walking the walk by maximizing the amount of money going directly to the players and intentionally closing one of their pay gaps.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s ironic that one of the most popular sports in the world is still experiencing pay inequalities between women and men,\u201d said Clif Bar & Company Owner and Co-CEO Kit Crawford. \u201cWe are big fans of the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team and were inspired to take action and make a difference that matters. LUNA Bar is honored to give these women, and women everywhere, our support. It\u2019s what is right, but more importantly, it\u2019s what they deserve.\u201d\nAll women deserve equal pay for equal work, whether working in an office or playing soccer on a global stage. By making their experience public, the players of the USWNT became advocates, mentors and role models. This Equal Pay Day, LUNA Bar is providing advice, support and inspiration to help women ask, prepare and negotiate for their own well-deserved equal pay.

Music: Ishikari Lore by Kevin MacLe... 15 Strange Things That Seem Normal Only In South Korea published: 21 May 2018 views: 7847081\nSouth Korea is a dream travel destination for many, an absolutely fantastic culture, a country of contrasts, where modern technologies and ancient Eastern traditions harmoniously combine into something totally unique in and of itself. Every journey to this amazing country reveals countless new secrets and mysteries. These crazy yet amazing facts South Korea might astonish you. Photo credits: https://m.pikabu.ru/profile/AdaKwon (2:57, 3:49, 4:41, 7:44) People in Korea really love practical gifts like this and especially ones that can be eaten. For example, management at one South Korean company presented their employees with food baskets. The Korean New Year usually takes place in January or February, depending on the time of the second new moon after the winter solstice. South Korea is home to the most visited church in the world with a parish consisting of over 1 million people a year. There\\'s an established gift-giving culture in Korea with certain rules. For example, big gifts to teachers or public officials are considered bribes. And when somebody visits your home in this country, you can be sure that they\u2019ll bring a drink, dessert, or fruit. In Seoul, there\\'s a subway train dedicated to a comedy animated series called \u201cLarva\u201d. It runs on the green line 8 times a day and features two of the cartoon\u2019s main characters in every car.

Believing in equal pay for equal work, LUNA Bar is giving each of the 23 women named to the 2019 USWNT World Cup team $31,250, comprising the difference between the women\u2019s and men\u2019s World Cup roster bonus.\nThis press release features multimedia.

Their fight continues today, as several inequalities remain, such as the World Cup roster bonus awarded to any U.S. soccer player, woman or man, named to the World Cup team. In 2019, each USWNT player was set to receive $31,250 LESS than their counterparts on the men\u2019s team\u2014until now. LUNA Bar has partnered with the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team Player\u2019s Association (USWNTPA) to make its donation directly to each of the 23 players.\n\u201cWhen LUNA Bar approached us in January to support and recognize the USWNT players in this way, I was speechless,\u201d said USWNTPA Executive Director Becca Roux. \u201cMany brands raising awareness for equal pay use the USWNT\u2019s fight as an example, but don\u2019t go the extra step to offer a solution to the problem. LUNA Bar has a long history of supporting women\u2019s equality and is truly walking the walk by maximizing the amount of money going directly to the players and intentionally closing one of their pay gaps.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s ironic that one of the most popular sports in the world is still experiencing pay inequalities between women and men,\u201d said Clif Bar & Company Owner and Co-CEO Kit Crawford. \u201cWe are big fans of the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team and were inspired to take action and make a difference that matters. LUNA Bar is honored to give these women, and women everywhere, our support. It\u2019s what is right, but more importantly, it\u2019s what they deserve.\u201d\nAll women deserve equal pay for equal work, whether working in an office or playing soccer on a global stage. By making their experience public, the players of the USWNT became advocates, mentors and role models. This Equal Pay Day, LUNA Bar is providing advice, support and inspiration to help women ask, prepare and negotiate for their own well-deserved equal pay.

A fresh sneak peek for the upcoming season has arrived, and we're treated to a shocking new scene that involves Clark Gregg's Coulson doppelganger and a couple other familiar faces. Take a look.\nDamn, he didn't even hesitate to shoot that guy! This Coulson look-alike isn't playing games, and it sounds like he's going to need to be filled in on S.H.I.E.L.D. and some other things. As for the characters we do know, they're looking a bit rattled by the fact he just drove a semi out of that smoke. There wasn't any sounds of the truck driving before it appeared, so did he emerge from a portal?\nFor now, it doesn't seem like we're any closer to learning what the deal is with this doppelganger. He's definitely a different character, as we've heard Clark Gregg say, but is he speaking figuratively or literally? Perhaps this character is Phil Coulson, but timeline manipulation and all that has changed his path to one that has made him completely oblivious to S.H.I.E.L.D's existence? He also could be the Coulson of another multiverse?\n\"Sarge,\" as he's called on ABC's press release, is just one of the things Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. 's main characters will have to deal with as they wrestle with the consequences of saving the planet. Fitz and Coulson are, supposedly, gone and clearly there's going to be some new challenges such as this Terminator-looking Coulson that rolled up on the scene. Clark Gregg has hinted we shouldn't expect Skrulls, so what's going on?\nThe clip above is from the Season 6 premiere, which is going to be a very special episode for Clark Gregg. The actor will be directing the premiere, which will mark the second episode he's done for Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. since Season 5's \"Fun & Games.\" Maybe it means something, but fans shouldn't read into it too much. With that said, it's impressive Gregg is handling this new character's premiere episode, especially given how attached he is to Coulson.\nWith so much disorienting footage coming out, the only thing Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. fans should expect is for even more episodes. Season 7 is already a sure thing , although there's been hints that the ride may be over after that. If the \"endgame\" for this Marvel series is on the horizon, then expect this abbreviated Season 6 to ramp up the action rather quick.\nThe wait for new Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is almost up, as Season 6 is due to air Friday, May 10 at 9:00 p.m. ET. Keep with CinemaBlend for updates on the Marvel series as they arise, as we work to unravel the mystery behind what should be an exciting season. For more on the series, check out the first trailer for the upcoming season, and try to remember the premiere isn't that far off!

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar moved off session lows against its rivals on Monday as stronger U.S. manufacturing data helped keep a lid on the downside following a sharp increase in the pound ahead of a fresh rounds of votes in the U.K. on a path for Brexit.\nThe U.S. dollar index , which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.02% to 96.78, but remained above session lows of 96.60.\nISM manufacturing data for March showed an uptick to 55.3, handily beating expectations of 54.5. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the U.S. economy.\n\"ISM Manufacturing for March came in above expectations and employment remains below cycle peaks but comfortably back near prevailing levels in 2018, as March showed the biggest one-month increase in three years. This points to a potentially strong NFP on Friday,\" BMO said in a note.\nThe stronger-than-expected ISM manufacturing data eased worries about slowing economic growth following signs of subdued U.S. consumer growth amid weaker-than-expected retail sales.\nThe Commerce Department said on Monday that retail sales fell 0.2% in February . That confounded economists\u2019 forecast for a 0.3% rise. The retail sales control group \u2013 which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP \u2013 fell 0.2% , missing expectations for a 0.4% increase.\nThe retail sales report provides the \"most significant hard data support for the market\u2019s pessimistic outlook, and it looks like this will remain the case for another month,\" Action Economics said.\nBut the dollar struggled to turn positive as sterling racked up gains ahead of a second round of votes due 3 PM ET (19:00 GMT) on a series of options that could help break the current impasse in parliament on the path for Brexit just weeks ahead of the latest EU Brexit deadline on April 12.\nThe four options to be voted on include a call on the government to negotiate a permanent customs union, the U.K joining the European Free Trade Association and European Economic Area (Common Market 2.0), a confirmatory public vote on the Brexit deal and a choice between no-deal Brexit or revoking Article 50 - stopping Brexit - if the EU does not agree to an extension.\nAmong the four options, a permanent customs union and a confirmatory public vote on the Brexit deal secured the most votes in the first round of voting last week.\nThe results of the vote are expected to come at around 5 PM ET (21:00 GMT).\nIf the options fail to gain majority support, a third round of votes is pencilled in for Wednesday.

Many investors are buying in anticipation of a rise in shares,\" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) Securities.\n\"But thinking about how things really are, at the end of the week (U.S.) jobless claims will be released and it&apos;s true that individual consumption, which accounts for 70 percent of gross domestic product, hasn&apos;t been good. I think that has to be taken into account,\" Fujito said.\nThe encouraging data on manufacturing activity in the world&apos;s two biggest economies led to a wobbly start to the U.S. bond market, with the U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields US10YT=RR booking their largest single-day jump since Jan. 4.\nThe U.S. 10-year Treasury yield overnight jumped to a more than one-week high of 2.502 percent, moving off a 15-month low of 2.340 percent touched on March 25.\nThe rise pushed the yield curve between three-month U.S. Treasury bills and 10-year notes further into positive territory, after being inverted for a week until last Friday.\nBREXIT CHAOS\nIn the currency market, sterling took a knock after British lawmakers came no nearer to resolving the chaos surrounding the country&apos;s departure from the European Union.\nThe British parliament failed on Monday to find a majority of its own for any alternative to Prime Minister Theresa May&apos;s divorce deal. only sensible thing for Theresa May to do is to step aside and let someone else take control of Brexit,\" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets in London.\n\"Failure to chose any of the options on Brexit took the floor under sterling and the currency stumbled like a rock,\" Aslam said in a note to clients.\nSterling was last down 0.25 percent at $1.3073 GBP=D4 , not far from last month&apos;s nadir of $1.2945.\nThe euro struggled near a three-week low of $1.1198 EUR= brushed early on Tuesday, and was last trading down a tenth of a percent at $1.1204.\nAgainst the Japanese yen, the dollar was down a tad at 111.33 yen JPY= , but 1.5 percent above its 1-1/2-month low of 109.70 touched on March 25.\nOil prices hovered near their four-month peaks, after two key benchmarks booked their largest first-quarter gains in nearly a decade on positive signs for the global economy and tighter supplies.

EU-U.S. Trade Talks Face Delay, Risking Trump Backlash (Bloomberg) -- European Union governments are struggling to reach consensus on a mandate to begin trade talks with the U.S., risking a delay that would further provoke Donald Trump\u2019s ire after the bloc\u2019s refusal to include agriculture in the negotiations.\nAt a meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday, France is expected to resist giving the European Commission the green light to start negotiations to eliminate industrial tariffs between the regions, according to two officials familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the talks are private. Failure to get France on board would mean the EU\u2019s executive arm won\u2019t be given a mandate to negotiate.\nThe main sticking points include the role of climate and environment in the mandate given the U.S. decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord and a clarification of what this negotiation would mean for the shelved Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, according to the officials.\nA draft mandate prepared ahead of the meeting of ambassadors and seen by Bloomberg reiterates that the EU seeks trade accords only with countries that have signed up to the Paris agreement against climate change, even though the U.S. has pulled out.\nThe EU has been trying to kick start trade deliberations with the U.S. in a bid to show President Trump progress in enacting a political accord that he reached with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in July. That agreement helped put on hold the American threat of tariffs on European cars and auto parts.\nWashington has shown frustration over the lack of progress since, with U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland saying in a February interview that \u201cso long as the EU leadership plays the delay game the more we will have to use leverage to realign the relationship.\u201d\nEU-U.S. Trade Talks Face Delay, Risking Trump Backlash", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=179222828858436&u=https%3A%2F%2Fca.investing.com%2Fnews%2Feconomy-news%2Feuus-trade-talks-face-delay-risking-trump-backlash-1433607&display=popup&ref=plugin", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fca.investing.com%2Fnews%2Feconomy-news%2Feuus-trade-talks-face-delay-risking-trump-backlash-1433607&title=EU-U.S.+Trade+Talks+Face+Delay%2C+Risking+Trump+Backlash&summary=", "https://invst.ly/afnba"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg \u00a9 reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "transatlantic trade and investment partnership", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T08:23:06.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9a7b9fa43b6d86a360a57fb37281fab2615b2673", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/aisa39270664", "site_full": "twitcasting.tv", "site": "twitcasting.tv", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["television", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "\u26a1\u5982\u6708 \u97f3\u26a1 (@Aisa39270664) 's Live - TwitCasting", "title_full": "\u26a1\u5982\u6708 \u97f3\u26a1 (@Aisa39270664) 's Live - TwitCasting", "published": "2019-03-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://imagegw03.twitcasting.tv/image3/image.twitcasting.tv/image77_1/09/9a/1ff09a09-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2374, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9a7b9fa43b6d86a360a57fb37281fab2615b2673", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/aisa39270664", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-03-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "\u26a1\u5982\u6708 \u97f3\u26a1 (@Aisa39270664) 's Live - TwitCasting", "text": "Title of work being infringed Details\nI read and understand the following notes and send this form.

This is despite the fact that HIIT is brutal, mentally as well as physically, but I suppose it\u2019s that old joke about the guy who was asked why he was banging his head against the wall and he replied, I like it when I stop!\n\u00a9 Provided by HT Digital Stream Limited If you go to the gym and come out completely wiped out, then you are just chasing fatigue. I realise that we live in a world where \u201cno pain no gain\u201d has been drummed into everybody but is all this necessary? But before I go further, let me define some terms. Steady State aka low intensity cardio is any type of cyclical exercise \u2013 running, cycling, rowing, swimming etc., done at a steady pace for about 30-90 minutes. The aim is to keep the heart rate between 120-150 beats per minute.\nHigh Intensity Interval Training, on the other hand, has bursts of high intensity exercise lasting 20 seconds to 60 seconds, followed by periods of active recovery, which could be anywhere from 120 to 180 seconds long. Heart rates spike very high during the high intensity interval while they drop in the active rest period. HIIT training rarely lasts longer than 20 minutes at a time.\n\u00a9 Provided by HT Digital Stream Limited Everybody seems to be aware of the benefits of HIIT \u2013 lots of calorie burning in a short period of time. It\u2019s generally considered a good way to burn fat and quickly develop fitness. But most people are not aware that HIIT plateaus in about four to six weeks. However, this is not the case with Steady State cardio.\nThe benefits of Steady State Cardio go beyond mere fat loss. Low intensity cardio improves the efficiency of the heart, more blood flows in to the heart and thus more can flow out. This leads to the heart pumping out more blood with each heartbeat and thus the heart becomes a lot more efficient.\nLow intensity cardio results in a shift towards a more relaxed state of being. People who engage in low intensity cardio sleep better and hence recover from their exercise bouts at a much faster rate.\nAlso, the whole HIIT burns more calories and thus is better for fat loss is more marketing hype than the real truth, as HIIT is difficult for somebody who is out of shape in terms of cardiovascular fitness. In fact if you are unfit and overweight, high intensity anything should not figure in your training program, as chances of injury would be very high.\n\u00a9 Provided by HT Digital Stream Limited \u2022If you train three times a week with weights, then do two days of low intensity cardio for 30 to 45 minutes.\n\u2022If you are lifting weights four times a week, then doing a 20-minute low intensity cardio session after the weights twice a week is a good way to include heart-friendly cardio in your routine. Also add a 30-minute brisk walk on the fifth day.\n\u2022If you are a beginner or want to put on muscle, then stay away from HIIT, as recovery would be severely affected.\nSleep better, recover faster, improve cardiac efficiency and generally feel better all over, what\u2019s not to like about low intensity, steady state cardio?\n(A strength and conditioning coach for the last 15 years, Kamal Singh, CSCS, specialises in post rehabilitation training and functional training.)\nReplay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBUBpBP.img&quot;},&quot;headlineImage&quot;:{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBUBpBP.img&quot;}}", "http://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x73wrl7&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;Dailymotion&quot;,&quot;sourceLogo&quot;:&quot;https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBViiHq.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;You", "https://api.dailymotion.com/videos?localization=gb&owners=popsugarfitness&fields=id,title,description,embed_url,created_time,modified_time,thumbnail_url,owner.username,duration&limit=10&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;displayAds&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "https://5d56a.v.fwmrm.net&quot;,&quot;HybridPlayerAdInitTimeout&quot;:", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "hindustan times", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "steady state cardio", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ht digital stream limited", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "high intensity cardio", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T08:28:32.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "09347479550d0bd48ebfbf19e7d1dcfeacb0ce33", "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/news/india-delays-levying-retaliatory-tariff-on-us-goods-to-may-2/ar-BBVvT3O", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "https://www.msn.com/en-in/money", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "Business News, Market Updates, Personal Finance News | MSN India", "title": "India delays levying retaliatory tariff on U.S. goods to May 2", "title_full": "India delays levying retaliatory tariff on U.S. goods to May 2", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.814, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "09347479550d0bd48ebfbf19e7d1dcfeacb0ce33", "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/news/india-delays-levying-retaliatory-tariff-on-us-goods-to-may-2/ar-BBVvT3O", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FB removes Cong linked pages", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "India delays levying retaliatory tariff on U.S. goods to May 2", "text": "India delays levying retaliatory tariff on U.S. goods to May 2 Reuters 21 hours ago \u00a9 AP India has once again delayed the implementation of higher tariffs on some goods imported from the United States to May 2, according to a government order.\nThe new tariff structure was to come into force from April 1.\nAngered by Washington's refusal to exempt it from new steel and aluminum tariffs, New Delhi decided in June last year to raise the import tax from Aug. 4 on some U.S. products including almonds, walnuts and apples.\nBut since then, New Delhi has repeatedly delayed the implementation of the new tariff.\n(Reporting by Nidhi Verma;

Investors, in turn, sold off supersafe government bonds, sending yields on long-term Treasury bonds above short-term interest rates Monday. That reversed a so-called inverted yield curve that had developed in late March in which short-term rates are higher than long rates, a precursor to economic downturns in the past.\nGauges of the U.S. and Chinese factory sectors stabilized last month from earlier slowdowns, sparking a rally in U.S. stocks after investors had braced for weaker readings. ( Andy Wong / AP Photo ) The U.S. Institute for Supply Management said its monthly index of manufacturing activity rose to 55.3 in March from 54.2 the previous month, with new orders particularly buoyant, boding well for U.S. factory output in the coming months. The index is based on whether manufacturing supply managers see activity at their companies expanding or contracting, with numbers above 50 indicating expansion.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve still got some juice behind us,\u201d said Tim Fiore, who oversees the U.S. survey. \u201cI don\u2019t think things are getting weak based on what I\u2019m seeing here.\u201d\nAn official purchasing managers index in China rebounded strongly, too, with a pickup in a measure of forward-looking orders. China\u2019s index rose to a six-month high of 50.5 in March from 49.2 in February, well above the forecasts of many economists. Power consumption, steel output and sales of bulldozers all rose.\n Though manufacturing activity accounts for a fraction of gross domestic product in the U.S., it is highly cyclical and is seen as a bellwether for the broader economy. The purchasing manager surveys are also timelier than official data, which have been delayed even more than usual this year by the partial government shutdown in December and January.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 329.74 points higher, or 1.3%, to 26258.42, while the yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose 0.08 percentage point to 2.496%. Bond yields rise when prices fall.\n\u201cWe\u2019re really just seeing growth moderate, consistent with the economy reverting back towards its trend after what was a pretty strong year thanks to fiscal stimulus,\u201d said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing [manufacturing] slow dramatically by any means.\u201d\nAt the same time, data showed Europe\u2019s manufacturing sector lagging far behind in March. The IHS Markit Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index for the eurozone fell to 47.5 in March from 49.3 in February, the biggest fall in output in nearly six years.\nTaken together, the purchasing manager indexes are important gauges of the world economy. Global growth has appeared to slow in recent months after a synchronized upturn early last year. Trade tensions hit not only U.S. and China but also businesses in markets that supplied them, including many in Europe.\nPolicy makers responded by trying to stimulate activity, with authorities in China cutting taxes and lifting spending and the Federal Reserve halting an interest-rate-raising campaign. The European Central Bank also modestly eased monetary policy.\nEconomists are now watching to see whether those steps clear the way for sustained growth or whether a deeper global downturn is building.\n For now, Europe appears to be having the most trouble regaining its footing.\nGermany, which relies more heavily on exports to drive growth than many other large economies, saw its PMI fall in March to the lowest level in nearly seven years. Germany\u2019s Mechanical Engineering Industry Association on Monday halved its production forecast for this year to a 1% increase, citing the trade dispute between the U.S. and China.\nOver recent decades, Germany has supplied high-end tools and equipment to China and other developing economies as they have beefed up manufacturing capacity.\nGerman auto makers have been grappling with slower demand for cars in China while also facing difficulties at home in upgrading models to comply with new European emissions standards. These difficulties are now percolating down the supply chain, affecting a broad range of smaller suppliers and services companies that depend on the industry.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a bloodbath for manufacturers in Europe this year, and the first improvement probably won\u2019t come until the second half of 2020,\u201d said Marco Bonometti, chairman of Italian auto supplier OMR Automotive and lobby group Confindustria Lombardia.\nIn the U.S., the ISM numbers, along with simultaneous reports showing better-than-expected construction spending in February, reassured some economists. JPMorgan revised its running estimate for U.S. gross-domestic-product growth in the first quarter to 2% from 1.5% after Monday\u2019s data.\nTimesavers Inc., a Maple Grove, Minn., producer of abrasive finishing machines for the wood- and metalworking industries, said customers were confident about the economy.\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll have a better year this year than last year, and things were good last year,\u201d said Peter Wernecke, the company\u2019s digital marketing manager. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think a recession is coming, and they are moving ahead with their purchases.\u201d\nThe next key report for the U.S. is Friday, when the Labor Department releases its monthly measures of hiring and unemployment.\nThe U.S. data weren\u2019t uniformly strong. Consumer spending has been mixed early in 2019. Retail sales, a measure of purchases at stores, restaurants and online, declined a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in February from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said Monday.\nIHS Markit\u2019s PMI for the U.S., which is less volatile than the ISM data, retreated to 52.4 in March from 53 in February. That was the lowest level since June 2017, though it remained in expansion.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the tenor is quite as bullish as it was a year ago for consumer sentiment as we see it. Not terrible, but not quite as good as it was,\u201d Liberty Media Corp. CEO Greg Maffei said at a March conference.\nAnd while the yield curve on U.S. Treasurys is no longer inverted, economists said the narrowing spread between long- and short-term yields suggests the nearly 10-year expansion could be approaching an end.\nIn China, some economists warn that a rebound could be tenuous. Some were skeptical about the higher PMI reading for March, seeing it as part of the normal seasonal recovery that happens after the long Lunar New Year holiday, the dates of which shift from year to year between January and February.\nAt a building-materials supply center in the south of Beijing, customers were scarce on a recent weekday. He Shengmiao, a sales manager, played with his phone inside his shop, which sells doors, made from aluminum, cedar and other materials, for $100 to $300 apiece. He said he had no clients.\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s just getting harder and harder each year. It\u2019s not just the property downturn. It\u2019s everything,\u201d Mr. He said, citing a clampdown on polluting factories, rising costs and \u201cjust not enough demand.\u201d\nWrite to Paul Kiernan at paul.kiernan@wsj.com and Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andy wong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul kiernan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "star business journal economy u.s.", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "wsj paul hannon wsj mon.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "treasury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. institute for supply management sa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T08:30:39.037+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8c058fbfada9523fef91c2c2af180ddcfb8df3a9", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/syuraneko_moon", "site_full": "twitcasting.tv", "site": "twitcasting.tv", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["television", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "\u6731\u7f85\u732b@\uff7e\uff72\uff70 (@syuraneko_moon) 's Live - TwitCasting", "title_full": "\u6731\u7f85\u732b@\uff7e\uff72\uff70 (@syuraneko_moon) 's Live - TwitCasting", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://imagegw03.twitcasting.tv/image3/image.twitcasting.tv/image77_1/d1/9b/1ff09bd1-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2374, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8c058fbfada9523fef91c2c2af180ddcfb8df3a9", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/syuraneko_moon", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "\u6731\u7f85\u732b@\uff7e\uff72\uff70 (@syuraneko_moon) 's Live - TwitCasting", "text": "Title of work being infringed Details\nI read and understand the following notes and send this form.

This is in retaliation for the tens of thousands of migrants leaving those countries each month for the U.S. White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney went on CNN yesterday to defend the move.\n(SOUNDBITE OF CNN BROADCAST)\nMICK MULVANEY: The people say it's working, but the proof is in the numbers. It's not working well enough to help us solve our border crisis, and that's what the president is focused on.\nCHANG: In a moment, we will hear from the U.S.-Mexico border. But first, let's focus on the hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance that could be at stake here. El Salvador's ambassador to the U.S. joins us now.\nClaudia Canjura, welcome.\nCLAUDIA IVETTE CANJURA DE CENTENO: Hello. Good afternoon. Thank you.\nCHANG: So have you heard directly from anyone in the Trump administration about this move? Did you get any warning, any guidance about it?\nCANJURA: You know, we - as government of El Salvador, we haven't received an official announcement from the government of...\nCHANG: Really?\nCANJURA: ...The U.S. regarding the cancellation of the economic aid for our country and for the Northern Triangle. So as - you - all we know - our country has made significant progress and - if the - each of the areas establishing the Northern Triangle prosperity plan. So we are confident that the cooperation that the people of the United States gives to our country will be maintained for the region.\nCHANG: Well, now President Trump is threatening to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance. What would that mean to El Salvador, to lose that money? How do you currently use those funds now?\nCANJURA: You know, that money - that money isn't managed directly for our government. That money is managed and administrated by different companies, enterprise - enterprises, NGOs that work in the government - that work...\nCHANG: And how do they spend the money?\nCANJURA: ...In our country. They spend the money in different programs of cooperation that are related to safety, to youth empowerment, to security, you know, that has to be with the creating better conditions of living in our country in terms of improving the conditions for our young people, creating jobs, creating great opportunities, developing spaces of recreation for our people. So it's a very important cooperation for our countries. But we don't manage the money, as government.\nCHANG: OK. Now, Mick Mulvaney, the president's chief of staff - he said yesterday that, quote, \"El Salvador could do more.\" What do you make of that pushback? What do you think your country could do to help slow down migration into the U.S.?\nCANJURA: What - what I can do is that we are making all our efforts - we're doing the best in terms of decrease in the movements of irregular migration. El Salvador is one of the countries in the region that has decreased it more than 60 percent, the arrivals at the north - at the southern border...\nCHANG: Right. But the Trump administration wants to see your country do more. Is there anything you can offer?\nCANJURA: We are working. You know, one of this - this weekend, this just past - last weekend, a codel, a delegation from congressman and congresswoman from the U.S., went to our country. And they could witness all the performance that the - the U.S.-El Salvador cooperation programs has and how they impact in appropriate way in - in our community. So they could see the performance and how we are doing the best that we can at all the levels - at the local levels with all our governments - with all our local governments in terms of improving the conditions.\nCHANG: Ambassador Claudia Canjura of El Salvador, thank you very much for joining us today.\nCANJURA: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to share with you.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

By Tony Cantu, Patch Staff | Apr 1, 2019 4:20 pm ET | Updated Apr 1, 2019 4:24 pm ET 0 Whole Foods owner Amazon will cut prices on 500-plus items stating on Wednesday of this week. (Photo by Rick Uldricks/Patch staff) AUSTIN, TEXAS \u2014 Amazon.com Inc. is planning to cut prices on hundreds of items at Austin-based Whole Foods stores this week, as the e-commerce giant seeks to shed its image as a high-cost grocer, according to a published report.\nOther than mitigating a reputation as pricey grocery store chain, Amazon also is cutting prices amid intense competition in the grocery store industry, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. Amazon bought the Whole Foods chain, which was founded in Austin, in August 2017 for $13.4 billion.\nPrices on more than 500 items \u2014 with more being added \u2014 are set to drop at Whole Foods stores across the U.S. on Wednesday, according to documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal. The products slated for price reduction range from sliced salami to popcorn to cod fillets, the newspaper noted.\nThis isn't the first time the e-commerce retail giant has made cuts to its merchandise since Amazon bought Whole Foods for nearly $14 billion two years ago. The moves are made to counter a perception among some consumers that buying groceries at a Whole Food store required a \"whole paycheck,\" the Journal reported.\nAs it revamps its image, the grocer also is contending with intense competition from other big food sellers such as Walmart Inc., Kroger Co. and others that are holding down prices in preserving their share of the $1 trillion U.S. market for groceries and consumer products, the business publication noted in its report. The move also comes as Amazon is poised to open a new line of grocery stores independent from Whole Foods as early as later this year, the Wall Street Journal reported.\nThe Journal reported that some Whole Foods employees are scheduled to work overnight Tuesday and early-morning shifts on Wednesday to switch out tags in reflecting newly cut prices , with bright orange signs installed to promote them further. The cuts are expected to last at least through the end of the year, according to the documents the Journal reviewed.\nDifferentiating this price cut from previous ones is that discounts this week will include more produce and meat products, the Journal reported. The price of organic-rainbow carrots, for instance, will drop by $1, to $1.99, and the price of Black Forest ham will drop $3 a pound to $9.99, according to the report.\n>>> Read the full story at Wall Street Journal\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/url?q=https://quotes.wsj.com/AMZN&source=gmail&ust=1554233965806000&usg=AFQjCNFSt_XbRjDEP1ocHEgBlvZGKZzz6Q", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-cuts-more-prices-at-whole-foods-11554146071", "https://quotes.wsj.com/WMT", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A//patch.com/texas/downtownaustin/amazon-set-cut-prices-austin-based-whole-foods&t=Amazon%20Set%20To%20Cut%20Prices%20At%20Whole%20Foods%20Stores%20Across%20U.S.", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A//patch.com/texas/downtownaustin/amazon-set-cut-prices-austin-based-whole-foods", "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-buy-whole-foods-for-13-7-billion-1497618446?mod%3Darticle_inline&source=gmail&ust=1554233965806000&usg=AFQjCNEEP0COaXyneUxuCyt_sEIrUtEIzQ", "https://quotes.wsj.com/KR", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-launch-new-grocery-store-business-sources-say-11551461887?mod=article_inline", "https://quotes.wsj.com/AMZN", "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://quotes.wsj.com/KR&source=gmail&ust=1554233965806000&usg=AFQjCNGzXh2x5Ox_H8J4TCGAuvbAec5UHg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Amazon%20Set%20To%20Cut%20Prices%20At%20Whole%20Foods%20Stores%20Across%20U.S.&url=https%3A//patch.com/texas/downtownaustin/amazon-set-cut-prices-austin-based-whole-foods", "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-launch-new-grocery-store-business-sources-say-11551461887?mod%3Darticle_inline&source=gmail&ust=1554233965806000&usg=AFQjCNFs3Oakwj5xdDrbL4Wlv_hxZHmqQw", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-buy-whole-foods-for-13-7-billion-1497618446?mod=article_inline", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A//patch.com/texas/downtownaustin/amazon-set-cut-prices-austin-based-whole-foods&title=Amazon%20Set%20To%20Cut%20Prices%20At%20Whole%20Foods%20Stores%20Across%20U.S.", "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://quotes.wsj.com/WMT&source=gmail&ust=1554233965806000&usg=AFQjCNHOfBctGe3XsympeQu6l8OQFBzDaQ"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tony cantu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rick uldricks/patch", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "whole foods stores across", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "whole foods", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon.com inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "downtown austin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tx", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wedne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T08:52:43.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6306f6925f41ce3dc32db42c7838ec5a4a5ba344", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/news/3447355-dsv-buy-logistics-company-panalpina-4_6b-deal", "site_full": "seekingalpha.com", "site": "seekingalpha.com", "site_section": "https://seekingalpha.com/market-news/m-a", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "mutual_funds"], "section_title": "M&amp;A News | Seeking Alpha", "title": "DSV to buy logistics company Panalpina in $4.6B deal -

Frustrated by an influx of migrant families arriving from Central America , Trump has ratcheted up his rhetoric on sealing the border, threatening that his administration could close ports as early as this week if Mexico doesn't do more to stem the flow of arrivals. But a number of Republicans representing border states urged caution, noting Mexico was the nation's third-largest trading partner last year. Others, including Republican leaders, stayed quiet as they sought to assess the seriousness of Trump's threat, which he has made previously without following through. \"The president made that statement out of frustration. I don't think he's going to actually shut off the border,\" Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told a forum in Washington on Monday. \"It would have a significant impact on our economy.\" \"I understand the president\u2019s frustration, but the unintended consequences of that, I think, would be bad for everybody,\" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. Several Republicans on Capitol Hill didn\u2019t seem to see the president\u2019s threat as something immediate and instead focused on the need to deal with immigration. \u201cWhat do you mean, shut it down?\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., responded when asked about Trump's threat. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment Monday. Illegal immigration remains lower than it was during the 1990s and 2000s, when Border Patrol agents regularly apprehended more than 1 million undocumented immigrants a year at the southern border. But the administration has pointed to a spike in Central American families making the journey north. In February, Border Patrol agents apprehended 66,450 people illegally crossing the southern border. A record high 36,174 of those (54 percent) were members of families and 6,825 (10 percent) were unaccompanied minors, according to Border Patrol data . Speaking to reporters Friday, Trump said there is a \"very good likelihood that I\u2019ll be closing the border next week\" to address the issue. White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday that the administration would need to see \"something dramatic\" to hold short of sealing the U.S. Mexico-border. The idea has drawn tepid a response from some within Trump's party. \"It's my view that we've got to keep the legitimate trade and travel and cross-border commerce happening at the ports entry while we also need to secure our border and address this crisis,\" Sen. Martha McSally, R-Arizona, told reporters Monday. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., wouldn't directly say whether he would support closing the border. \"What the president seems to be doing right now is trying to work with Mexico and with Central America, and say, 'If we don\u2019t find a way to work together to stop this, then I\u2019m going to have to find a way that\u2019s a blunt object to do it,'\" Lankford said. At least one Democrat said the threat of border closure was real. \u201cI think you\u2019ve gotta take him seriously,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also weighed in Monday, urging the administration to consider the costs to domestic exporters. The leading business organization said it shared the administration's concern about a \"massive influx of migrants\" but said the best response is for Congress to attempt a broader overhaul of immigration law. \"Even threatening to close the border to legitimate commerce and travel creates a degree of economic uncertainty that risks compromising the very gains in growth and productivity that policies of the Trump administration have helped achieve,\u201d said Neil Bradley, the group's executive vice president and chief policy officer. The Commerce Department estimates $502 billion in goods crossed the border in trucks and trains last year, roughly $1.4 billion a day. That doesn't include products shipped by air and sea. Administration officials have said the border has reached its \"breaking point,\" forcing Customs and Border Protection to use extreme measures to keep up. One of those changes has been to start releasing migrants into the streets of border communities, breaking with the administration's practice of detaining them as long as possible. Trump's proposal has met with support from some Republicans, while many others have not commented. Some Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, initially advised Trump against declaring an emergency at the border to free up federal funding for the wall, but then backed the move once Trump acted. \"Well, I mean, what are we supposed to do?\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a Trump ally told \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"So if the president feels like that the only way to control this problem is to move the people from the port of entry to the ungoverned spaces where we need a wall, I will support him. I hope we don't have to do that.\" Trump threatened to close the border several times last year, but the administration did not follow through on the threat. \"Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants, many of whom are stone cold criminals, back to their countries,\" Trump tweeted in late November. \"We will close the Border permanently if need be.\" Contributing: Alan Gomez, USA TODAY, and The Arizona Republic", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration%C2%A0"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "michael mccaul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. chamber of commerce", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "house foreign affairs committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T08:57:10.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aba4acc4e77c73cef192ba8eccd12e5ce41d29d2", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/lemontea______", "site_full": "twitcasting.tv", "site": "twitcasting.tv", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["television", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "\u308c\u3082\u3093 (@LemonTea ) 's Live - TwitCasting", "title_full": "\u308c\u3082\u3093 (@LemonTea ) 's Live - TwitCasting", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://imagegw03.twitcasting.tv/image3/image.twitcasting.tv/image75_1/b5/ae/1ff0aeb5-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2374, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aba4acc4e77c73cef192ba8eccd12e5ce41d29d2", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/lemontea______", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "\u308c\u3082\u3093 (@LemonTea ) 's Live - TwitCasting", "text": "Title of work being infringed Details\nI read and understand the following notes and send this form.

Pam Godwin hit the spot once again! I didn\u2019t know what to think when I heard Tiago Badell would be the hero in Take. Not meant as a standalone you need to read the other books in the series to truly capture all the things happening in here. I already knew Tiago from Devastate and I knew what he was capable of. I had another man in mind for Kate even if after reading Take I can clearly see why Pam chose Tiago over that other guy. It\u2019s not his time yet. Take is an action packed dark story mixing deceit, passion, pain and redemption. Raw, real and surprising Kate & Tiago\u2019s story is one of a kind. Definitely no heart and flowers but with a lots of hurts and wrong. Even in the darkest place, you can find love. Tiago and Kate sure did. \u201cDo you want to live, Kate?\u201d She choked on a whimper. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAre you worthy of mercy?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cConvince me.\u201d Tiago is the perfect example of an anti-hero you love to hate. Rough, unapologetic, he\u2019s the definition of evil but if you scratch the surface you\u2019ll see that actions have reasons. I\u2019m not saying Tiago can\u2019t be forgiven easily but damn his story isn\u2019t an easy one and sanity is often lost in dark times. I had a hard time believing Pam Godwin could can redeem the irredeemable but she did! I should have known she already did with Van Quiso.Kate is without a doubt my favorite woman in the delivers series! Fierce, full of fight and never giving up, she gives as much as she takes. After being taken 2 times you\u2019d think she\u2019d feel a bit desperate but not at all. Kate fights all the time and show no fear. \u201cWhat are you going to do to me?\u201d\u201cEverything you\u2019re dreading and more.\u201d Take shows you the ugly but also the beautiful because there\u2019s always light in darkness. Now you\u2019ll have to trust Pam to show you the way.As for me, I\u2019m thrilled about the next book...

This Week A salute to the importance of the national count, Santa Clara County hosts a launch event on Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. By Sue Wood, Patch Staff | Apr 1, 2019 12:07 pm ET 0 The county hopes residents will contribute because an accurate count results in critical funds and representation. (Shutterstock) SAN JOSE, CA -- The one-year countdown to Census 2020 has begun.\nSanta Clara County will host the U.S. Census Bureau, governmental agencies, nonprofits, and community partners on April 2 to address critical issues before the Census launch.\n\"The county of Santa Clara relies on almost $500 million in annual census-based funds to provide critical services to its residents,\" said Nick Kuwada, Census 2020 program manager for the county. \"The consequences of an incomplete count would be enormous for the county and its residents because it would lead to less funding for roads, healthcare and other vital services the community relies on.\"\nU.S. Census representatives will join the county at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday at the Mexican Heritage Plaza located at 1700 Alum Rock Ave. in San Jose\nFor the first time in history, the Census will be conducted primarily online instead of by mail. Santa Clara County residents will have four methods for response: internet, phone, paper form or in-person.\nMore than $675 billion in federal funding is distributed annually based on census data. Of that amount, California receives over $76 billion.\nMoreover, congressional representation is based on census data.\nThe Census has prompted a variety of concerns over questions ranging from immigration status to sexual orientation. Other challenges the Santa Clara County cites involve:\nFewer than seven in 10 households said they intend to fill out the census form. Locally, the hard-to-reach populations have a census response rate of less than 70 percent; including older adults, individuals with disabilities, immigrants and refugees. The federal government has reduced funding that assists with getting an accurate census count, limiting the manpower to contact residents about the census.

A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the U.S. economy.\n\"ISM Manufacturing for March came in above expectations and employment remains below cycle peaks but comfortably back near prevailing levels in 2018, as March showed the biggest one-month increase in three years. This points to a potentially strong NFP on Friday,\" BMO said in a note.\nThe stronger-than-expected ISM manufacturing data eased worries about slowing economic growth following signs of subdued U.S. consumer growth amid weaker-than-expected retail sales.\nThe Commerce Department said on Monday that retail sales fell 0.2% in February . That confounded economists\u2019 forecast for a 0.3% rise. The retail sales control group \u2013 which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP \u2013 fell 0.2% , missing expectations for a 0.4% increase.\nThe retail sales report provides the \"most significant hard data support for the market\u2019s pessimistic outlook, and it looks like this will remain the case for another month,\" Action Economics said.\nBut the dollar struggled to turn positive as sterling racked up gains ahead of a second round of votes due 3 PM ET (19:00 GMT) on a series of options that could help break the current impasse in parliament on the path for Brexit just weeks ahead of the latest EU Brexit deadline on April 12.\nThe four options to be voted on include a call on the government to negotiate a permanent customs union, the U.K joining the European Free Trade Association and European Economic Area (Common Market 2.0), a confirmatory public vote on the Brexit deal and a choice between no-deal Brexit or revoking Article 50 - stopping Brexit - if the EU does not agree to an extension.\nAmong the four options, a permanent customs union and a confirmatory public vote on the Brexit deal secured the most votes in the first round of voting last week.\nThe results of the vote are expected to come at around 5 PM ET (21:00 GMT).\nIf the options fail to gain majority support, a third round of votes is pencilled in for Wednesday. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May could also attempt to bring her Brexit deal, which has been defeated on three occasions, before parliament for a fourth vote.\nEUR/USD fell 0.09% to $1.1206 as data showed eurozone manufacturing activity continued to contract in March, prompting analysts' to warn that the single currency will likely continue its drift lower.\n\"EUR/USD is set to go on testing the downside, supported only by the scale of shorts in the market.

Aside from the humanitarian reasons and the terrible precedent it would set, his latest threat to close the Southern Border would be an economic disaster.\n\"Mexico is the United States' third biggest trading partner, accounting for more than $1.6 billion in two-way trade each day, including $2.1 million in commercial exchange between San Diego and Tijuana alone. Mexico is California's top export market, accounting for 17.3 percent of our state's exports.\n\"In a single day, 70,000 vehicles, including more than 16,500 trucks carrying food, goods and parts, and nearly 1 million people cross lawfully through our ports of entry. In fact, nearly 70 percent of the commerce along our border is done via trucks, including more than $42 billion through Otay Mesa in California, the nation's second busiest truck port, each year.\n\"If the president shuts the border down, even for a short period of time, trade would crash to a screeching halt. When he shut the San Ysidro port of entry down for five hours in November, San Diego shop owners lost $5.3 million in sales.\n\"While some in the president's administration have tried to walk back his outlandish tweets, I strongly believe the president needs to consider the serious ramifications of closing the Southern Border before tweeting that threat out.\"\n###\n=\nRobert Riechel\nSend your articles and photos to:\nE=Mail: SanBrunoPatch.Robert@Yahoo.com\nWEB: http://SanBrunoPatch.com\nPhoto Credit: San Bruno CA Patch Archives\nSource Credit: U.S. Senator Diane Feinstein \u2013 (D-Calif)\nWeb Site: https://www.feinstein.senate.g...\nContact 331 Hart Senate Office Building Washington D.C. 20510\nPhone: 202 \u2013 224 \u2013 3841 Fax: 202 \u2013 228 - 3954\nCLICK on link below to Subscribe to News Alerts and a Daily Email Newsletter for San Bruno Patch\nhttp://link.patch.com/join/3-0-subscribe?list=US_CA_SANBRUNO_282\n#SanBrunoPatch\nGet the San Bruno newsletter", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=3CE7D274-C4E5-4ED4-97DB-9FF6C09ECDC3", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=U.S.%20Senator%20Feinstein%20On%20Border%20Closing&url=https%3A//patch.com/california/sanbruno/u-s-senator-feinstein-border-closing", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A//patch.com/california/sanbruno/u-s-senator-feinstein-border-closing&title=U.S.%20Senator%20Feinstein%20On%20Border%20Closing", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A//patch.com/california/sanbruno/u-s-senator-feinstein-border-closing&t=U.S.%20Senator%20Feinstein%20On%20Border%20Closing", "http://SanBrunoPatch.com", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A//patch.com/california/sanbruno/u-s-senator-feinstein-border-closing", "https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "feinstein", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "neig", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "robert riechel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dianne feinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "close southern border mar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern border", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate judiciary ranking", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tijuana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san bruno patch archive", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san diego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T10:03:00.050+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b0f7516b202cb1300ebe4f41ca50abeeda4fcdae", "url": "https://patch.com/california/sanbruno/u-s-senator-feinstein-implementation-dairy-provisions", "site_full": "patch.com", "site": "patch.com", "site_section": "https://patch.com/california/sanbruno", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "San Bruno, CA Patch - Breaking Local News Events Schools Weather &amp; Sports", "title": "U.S. Senator Feinstein - Implementation Of The Dairy Provisions", "title_full": "U.S. Senator Feinstein - Implementation Of The Dairy Provisions | San Bruno, CA Patch", "published": "2019-03-30T12:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn20.patchcdn.com/users/107116/20190329/050133/styles/T800x600/public/processed_images/us-senate-logo-1553893063-2754.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 465, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b0f7516b202cb1300ebe4f41ca50abeeda4fcdae", "url": "https://patch.com/california/sanbruno/u-s-senator-feinstein-implementation-dairy-provisions", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Robert Riechel", "published": "2019-03-30T12:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "U.S. Senator Feinstein - Implementation Of The Dairy Provisions", "text": "This post was contributed by a community member.

Early analysis has shown that the improvements would provide much-needed financial support to dairy farmers \u2013 providing significant benefits for all operations and up to 5 times as much support for the smallest farms.\n\"The situation for dairy farmers is urgent,\" the senators wrote. \"Although Dairy Margin Coverage is effective as of January 1, 2019, the government shutdown delayed action on 2018 Farm Bill implementation for over a month. During this time, dairy farmers have continued to face market instability and are struggling to survive the fourth year of sustained low prices.\"\n\"The changes to the Dairy Margin Coverage program make it a much more flexible policy that will likely benefit many of the farmers who chose not to participate in the Margin Protection Program. The USDA should strongly encourage these farmers to consider the Dairy Margin Coverage program,\"wrote the senators.\n\"In the interim, we request that the USDA invest in outreach, training, coordination with partner organizations, and staffing to ensure that every eligible farmer receives personalized information about the new and improved options,\" wrote the senators.\nThe 2018 Farm Bill also made several other important changes to address the needs of dairy producers, including: a study on the feed components of the margin calculation, a provision to counteract the disincentive for milk donation, continuation of forward contracting, an update to the Class I pricing formula, and a partial refund or credits from premiums paid under the former Margin Protection Program.\nIn addition to Feinstein, Stabenow, Blunt the letter was signed by Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Christopher Murphy (D-Conn.), James E. Risch (R-Idaho), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), M. Michael Rounds (R-S.D.), Robert P.

(Video by Taku Hosokawa) A crew member checks an Osprey of the U.S. Marines after it made an emergency landing at Osaka Airport on April 1. (Taku Hosokawa)\nITAMI, Hyogo Prefecture--A U.S. military Osprey aircraft made an emergency landing at Osaka Airport here on April 1, forcing a temporary shutdown of a runway, disrupting flight schedules and annoying surrounding municipalities.\nThe three crew members aboard the tilt-rotor transport aircraft were uninjured, and the Osprey was not damaged in the landing, according to the Defense Ministry\u2019s Kinki-Chubu Defense Bureau in Osaka.\nThe aircraft, deployed at the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in Okinawa Prefecture, was heading to the Naval Air Facility Atsugi in Kanagawa Prefecture after taking off from the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Yamaguchi Prefecture, the Defense Ministry said.\nThe transport ministry\u2019s Osaka Airport office said the Osprey pilot contacted it about unspecified problems, and office closed one of the airport\u2019s two runways in time for the expected emergency landing.\nThe Osprey landed at 1:56 p.m. and moved to a parking apron on its own.\nThe emergency landing caused delays up to 19 minutes for two arrivals and five departures, according to the transport ministry.\nThe U.S. Marines explained the emergency landing was made following set procedures after the Osprey\u2019s warning lamp flashed. But they did not explain why the warning light turned on.\nAuthorities in surrounding municipalities dispatched fire engines to the airport after being alerted to the Osprey\u2019s emergency landing. But they were given few details.\n\u201cWe find it extremely regrettable that we were not provided information promptly,\u201d said Yasuyuki Fujiwara, the Itami mayor who heads a consulting body that addresses problems concerning Osaka Airport.\nThe consulting body comprises 10 municipalities around the airport, which is hosted by Itami in Hyogo Prefecture, and Toyonaka and Ikeda in Osaka Prefecture.\nThe Osprey took off from the airport at 1:43 p.m. on April 2 after repairs.\nThe U.S. military uses Ospreys for training across Japan.\nSince the first Osprey deployment at Futenma in 2012, the aircraft has made emergency landings in other civilian airports, including Amami Airport in Kagoshima Prefecture and Oita Airport in Oita Prefecture.

(AP Photo / Carlos Osorio) The Associated Press Published Tuesday, April 2, 2019 2:39AM EDT Last Updated Tuesday, April 2, 2019 10:25AM EDT\nThe American women have beaten Canada in seven of the last eight world hockey championship finals, including a 3-2 overtime win two years ago in Michigan.\nMost expect another showdown between the top two national teams at this worlds, which opens Thursday in Espoo, Finland. Canada will play Switzerland and U.S. faces host Finland.\nCanada hasn't beaten the U.S. in a tournament final since the 2014 Four Nations Cup and hasn't won the world title since 2012. Still, taking two of three games against their Olympic champion frenemies to win February's \"Rivalry Series\" gives Canada some momentum.\n\"Our goal in the February series wasn't to come away with wins. That was a bonus,\" veteran forward Brianne Jenner told The Canadian Press. \"Our goal was to establish the way we want to play and take steps forward toward the performance you want in the world championships. Obviously, it's reassuring when you're able to play that way and get some wins as well. We look at it as a good step in the right direction, but we know there's a bit of a ways to go to get gold in Finland.\"\nThe tournament features 10 teams for the first time, expanding an eight-team format that has been in place since 2010. Women's hockey at the 2022 Winter Olympics also will be a 10-team tournament.\nThe world championship format was revamped after 2010. The top two seeds in Group A never faced the bottom two in Group B, which eliminated a pair of lopsided scores from the tournament. The world's top five seeds -- defending champion United States, Canada, Finland, Russia, Switzerland -- are in Group A in Espoo. Sweden, Japan, Germany, Czech Republic and France, ranking sixth to 10th, comprise Group B.\nWhat's different this year is the prospect of Canada and the U.S. playing quarterfinal games against a Group B opponent: There are no longer byes to the semifinals for the top two teams in Group A ahead of the April 14 final.\nGina Kingsbury, Hockey Canada's director of women's national teams, said two more countries in the world championship can help grow the game -- and she likes having the Canadian team playing together in a non-Olympic year.\n\"To me, it's a win-win,\" Kingsbury said. \"It allows us to build some critical experience with our group. I do like the schedule more and how it's spread out. There is a bit of a routine there that can come into place.\"\nCanada must play a game at least every second day in Espoo to reach the final.\n\"When I look at the world championship schedule, to me that's exactly a best-of-seven series in the NHL,\" head coach Perry Pearn said. \"You have to get up on game days, you've got to be energized and ready to go. The day after, you've got to come down a little bit, get relaxed, stay relaxed, be able to rest and then you get back up for the next one.\"\nNotes: Canadian captain and forward Marie-Philip Poulin didn't play for Les Canadiennes de Montreal in her team's Clarkson Cup semifinal series or the March 24 final because of a lower-body injury. Her status is unknown for the world tournament.

This Week A salute to the importance of the national count, Santa Clara County hosts a launch event on Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. By Sue Wood, Patch Staff | Apr 1, 2019 12:07 pm ET 0 The county hopes residents will contribute because an accurate count results in critical funds and representation. (Shutterstock) SAN JOSE, CA -- The one-year countdown to Census 2020 has begun.\nSanta Clara County will host the U.S. Census Bureau, governmental agencies, nonprofits, and community partners on April 2 to address critical issues before the Census launch.\n\"The county of Santa Clara relies on almost $500 million in annual census-based funds to provide critical services to its residents,\" said Nick Kuwada, Census 2020 program manager for the county. \"The consequences of an incomplete count would be enormous for the county and its residents because it would lead to less funding for roads, healthcare and other vital services the community relies on.\"\nU.S. Census representatives will join the county at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday at the Mexican Heritage Plaza located at 1700 Alum Rock Ave. in San Jose\nFor the first time in history, the Census will be conducted primarily online instead of by mail. Santa Clara County residents will have four methods for response: internet, phone, paper form or in-person.\nMore than $675 billion in federal funding is distributed annually based on census data. Of that amount, California receives over $76 billion.\nMoreover, congressional representation is based on census data.\nThe Census has prompted a variety of concerns over questions ranging from immigration status to sexual orientation. Other challenges the Santa Clara County cites involve:\nFewer than seven in 10 households said they intend to fill out the census form. Locally, the hard-to-reach populations have a census response rate of less than 70 percent; including older adults, individuals with disabilities, immigrants and refugees. The federal government has reduced funding that assists with getting an accurate census count, limiting the manpower to contact residents about the census.
