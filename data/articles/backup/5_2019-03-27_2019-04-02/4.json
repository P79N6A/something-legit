U.S. Census Bureau\nThe federal government will begin its massive effort to count everyone living in the U.S. beginning April 1, 2020. But a cloud still hangs over the process because of a citizenship question that may be on the form.\nIt affects the amount of money counties and cities get for everything from transportation to health care.

Many believe this will mean undocumented people won't take part, pushing down the number of people counted.\nHillsborough County Commissioner Les Miller said he's hoping the issue will be resolved by next year.\n\"That's a difficult one,\" he said at a news conference when asked about the citizenship question. \"Because there are a lot of people that may not want to do it, because of the mere fact that they feel they might be putting themselves in jeopardy. And that's unfortunate. But the courts will rule on that.\"\nAna Curas of the Central Florida division of the U.S. Census Bureau says undocumented people who choose not to fill out the form could affect the amount of money counties and cities get for a lot of programs.\n\"If you only count 100 out of 500, all 500 are going to be impacted and affected by not receiving the federal funding that they need,\" she said, \"not only for one year, we're talking about for the next decade.\" From left, Hillsborough Commissioner Les Miller, Ana Curas of the U.S. Census Bureau and County Commissioner Pat Kemp Credit Steve Newborn / WUSF Public Media\nNext year's census will also be the first time questions can be answered online, as well as in person.\nFlorida gained two new House seats in Congress after the 2010 census for a total of 27, tied with New York and trailing only California and Texas.\nWith Florida having passed New York in population over the last decade, it is expected Florida will gain one or two seats in Congress, while New York and several other mostly northern states are expected to lose some representation.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve newborn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "les miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ana curas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. census u.s. census", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillsborough county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T10:52:48.084+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "410aeab1293a40d1f68ccf3e85bf729682ee83aa", "url": "https://au.investing.com/analysis/ibm-surprises-chooses-stellar-platform-for-new-payment-transfer-service-200199987", "site_full": "au.investing.com", "site": "investing.com", "site_section": "https://au.investing.com/", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Investing.com Australia - Financial News, Stock Quotes &amp; Charts", "title": "IBM Surprises, Chooses Stellar Platform For New Payment Transfer Service | Investing.com AU", "title_full": "IBM Surprises, Chooses Stellar Platform For New Payment Transfer Service | Investing.com AU", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.066, "main_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/companies_logos/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 699, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "410aeab1293a40d1f68ccf3e85bf729682ee83aa", "url": "https://au.investing.com/analysis/ibm-surprises-chooses-stellar-platform-for-new-payment-transfer-service-200199987", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Investing.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "IBM Surprises, Chooses Stellar Platform For New Payment Transfer Service | Investing.com AU", "text": "Investing.com Articles (434) Our Website Follow What's perhaps most surprising, and possibly even somewhat cutting edge about International Business Machines' (NYSE: IBM ) recently launched Blockchain World Wire payment transfer service isn't who the provider is, nor that the solution is blockchain-based. Rather it's the open-source platform on which it's built\u2014 Stellar Lumens , the ninth most popular cryptocurrency by market cap.\nJesse Lund, head of IBM's blockchain division praises the payments and settlement network saying it cements the tech giant's leadership in the blockchain technology space. He characterizes the development of World Wire, which is now being used by six international banks including Philippines-based RCBC, South Korea's Bank Busan and Brazil's Banco Bradesco as:\n\u201cWe\u2019re building on a new idea, which is to be able to store monetary value electronically and be able to move that value around the world in real time\u2026 I think the problem with cross-border payments today, the inefficiencies are based on the fact that the way that banks communicate, the network that banks communicate on is separate from the network or the rails that money actually moves on.\nMany would argue it's already possible to store monetary value electronically and move it around in real time. Banks are already virtual although the funds stored are not yet fully digital. Which means IBM may not really be doing anything groundbreaking here.\nThat is, unless you consider Big Blue's use of Stellar. Until now, larger rival XRP , formerly known as Ripple, had been the banking industry choice. That's because, according to its developers, \"it enables secure, instant and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks.\" But, says Viabhav Kadikar, CEO of CloseCross , a decentralized market prediction platform, Steller is the preferred chain for micropayments, as it's relatively inexpensive:\n\u201cIBM has made an operational decision in choosing them [Stellar] as a network to build on. A considerable difference to the current virtual offering by banks is that the proposed flow of funds through World Wire will not require after the fact, cross border reconciliations to be carried out. This process normally involves a number of banks and even federal banks, so with World Wire they are proposing an overall increase in efficiency and transparency.\u201d\nThe way IBM portrays it, they're building a new backbone for banks, using blockchain, explains Alex Frenkel, VP of product at Kin Ecosystem. He stresses that blockchain technology is slower and harder to maintain than a conventional database. Its main virtue is in the direct exchange of value between people around the world.\n\u201cI'm not sure this is the most efficient way to improve the banking backbone,\" he adds. \"The real revolution with blockchain and crypto is removing the need to use banks for sending value across the world. In this vision, banks will have a completely different role in the financial world and will not deal with controlling and validating value exchanges between people.\u201d\nBreaking Banks Out of Their Comfort Zone\nMany banks, however, are still operating within their comfort zone, Kadikar points out.\n\"But partnering with a tech giant like IBM will [make them] feel more confident trialing new technology.\nLarge banks and corporates need to be in their comfort zone when they attempt to trial or utilize new tech. They need a partner that is solid, large and reliable based on previous experiences as well as something their regulators will accept.\u201d\nTo that end, the launch of IBM's World Wire is a good thing for the overall blockchain landscape, especially for the payments industry where the back-end functions can develop at scale in a blockchain environment without any user experience friction.\nThere is also a case to be made that transaction times and fees will drop with this latest launch. Gadi Srebnik, blockchain team lead at Kin Blockchain, which is a fork of Stellar Blockchain, believes that has serious benefits for the end consumer. \"Clients will gain as work\u2014and costs\u2014are reduced on the banking side,\u201d he says.\nPerhaps more important than the workflow and settlement efficiencies, IBM is setting the technology standard that all banks will need to meet going forward, Jehan Chu, co-founder of Social Alpha Foundation and managing partner of Kenetic points out.\n\u201cAs banks compete even harder, the near instant global settlement across their network will eventually become the new norm. IBM is signalling where the future of finance lies, and it\u2019s built on blockchain. Banks are moving from the electronic age to the digital age, with blockchain as it\u2019s connective tissue.\u201d\nIBM Surprises, Chooses Stellar Platform For New Payment Transfer Service", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=179222828858436&u=https%3A%2F%2Fau.investing.com%2Fanalysis%2Fibm-surprises-chooses-stellar-platform-for-new-payment-transfer-service-200199987&display=popup&ref=plugin", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fau.investing.com%2Fanalysis%2Fibm-surprises-chooses-stellar-platform-for-new-payment-transfer-service-200199987&title=IBM+Surprises%2C+Chooses+Stellar+Platform+For+New+Payment+Transfer+Service&summary=", "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.socialalphafoundation.org/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;ust%3D1553735488133000&sa=D&ust=1553735488141000&usg=AFQjCNFjVrMTIPjIWJlXxY0iK7jRUds6ug", "https://invst.ly/afrgl", "https://twitter.com/close_cross", "https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/03/21/discussing-ibms-foray-into-blockchain-based-payment-systems.html?&qsearchterm=blockchain"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jesse lund", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new payment transfer service", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ibm", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rcbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank busan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banco bradesco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international business machines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T10:52:53.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "56f2fc80926ddba56a7d31b6d31c2de3ff3c3fe2", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-cracks-down-fentanyl-blames-101403121.html", "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "media", "tech"], "section_title": "Yahoo News - Latest News &amp; Headlines", "title": "China cracks down on fentanyl, blames U.S. for its abuse [Video]", "title_full": "China cracks down on fentanyl, blames U.S. for its abuse [Video]", "published": "2019-04-01T20:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 30, "participants_count": 25, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.18, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jkU_saH9EN.ARNufXYEiWw--~B/aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/15343/415f06a1-75ed-44d0-b2ec-bc8cb55f9029/11730989-e9d8-5223-af6f-bee2078d4fb9/data_3_0.jpg?s=55151326355c6d297658300fede7981f&amp;c=e046606cfa1cac97d63e3ba4d99a448c&amp;a=reuters&amp;mr=0", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 7, "comments": 1, "shares": 35}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "56f2fc80926ddba56a7d31b6d31c2de3ff3c3fe2", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-cracks-down-fentanyl-blames-101403121.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Reuters Videos", "published": "2019-04-01T20:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "China cracks down on fentanyl, blames U.S. for its abuse [Video]", "text": "China will expand the range of fentanyl-related substances it defines as controlled narcotics, but Beijing blames U.S. culture for abuse of the drug.

Chavan Pratisthan - had a reserve price tag of Rs 1.69 crore based on the local estimated market value, but it fetched Rs 11 lakhs extra for the government.\nThe details of the auction and the identity of the buyer are not available. However, news agency ANI reported that four other properties related to relatives of the fugitive gangster were auctioned along with with Haseena's flat. A total number of 30 parties reportedly took part in the auction through e-auction, public auction and a sealed tender.\nParkar who has had a Bollywood movie caricaturing her life is the sister of fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim. Ibrahim is wanted by several agencies over the dastardly Mumbai blasts. In 2017, a biopic on Parkar's life titled as \"Haseena Parkar\", directed by Apoorva Lakhia with Shradhha Kapoor playing the title role as the Don of Nagpada don released. The movie, however received average response among viewers.\nThe flat, originally owned by Dawood was taken over by mother Amina, and then by Parkar, after Ibrahim fled the country post mid-1980s.\nThe Don's sister is alleged to have handled his mafia operations in Maximum City Mumbai following the government's counter-terrorism operations post 1993 blasts.\nIn April 2018, after a Supreme Court order, the authorities attached seven of Ibrahim's properties in south Mumbai and the Parkar flat was the second one belonging to the don that has been auctioned under SAFEMA.\nMarried to Ismail Parkar, the late Don of Nagpada had been reported as having taken to active criminal activities after her husband was killed by Shailesh Haldankar and three other sharpshooters of rival don Arun Gawli gang in July 1992.\nIn September 1992, Dawood avenged his brother-in-law's murder by sending a heavily armed 24-strong elimination squad which gunned down Haldankar and two policemen in the state-run Sir J.J. Hospital. This, became legendary as the J.J.

Former SK Telecom teammates Classic and Dark faced in five major playoff matches in 2018, and they made no effort to hide their disdain for each other. Said Serral, of Maru : \"Well personally, I hate the rivalry narrative. Personally, I\u2019m not a fan of it and I try to dodge it, but I guess that\u2019s what people want.\" Said Classic, of Dark : \"You know, if you keep running into someone, you should feel happy to see them. I'm not glad at all. Every time I run into him, I hate to see his face.\" It all started back in 2016 when Dark was having a peculiarly selfish season, winning barely over 50% of his games for SKT in Proleague while he casually won championships and beat up on his teammates in individual leagues. That included crushing Classic in two SSL tournaments, and the relationship has only soured ever since. The two have continued to face each other in high stakes matches over the years, and their trash-talk has evolved along the way. What started as Dark gently poking at Classic for being a 'grandfather' turned into Classic calling Dark a bad human being for lying about buying teammates a meal after a team-kill, which escalated into Dark spending all of 2018 telling Classic to **** off to the army already.Hajinsun recorded the latest salvo between the two as they headed into this semifinal match. Dark: I think Rogue will advance, but I'm going to be cheering for Classic.Hajin: Do you mean ZvP is better for you?Dark: No, I haven't lost to Classic in the semifinals ever. (Dark lost their LATEST head-to-head match in the Super Tournament II semifinals) To which Classic responded : Classic: I think Dark is far below Rogue, so from my point of view, I've already reached the finals. All this makes you wonder why I called these two players 'frenemies' earlier when it seems like they're just straight-up deadly foes. First off, it's hard for Korean pros to so vocally trash each other unless they have some friendship beneath it. Second, if Classic truly despised Dark, he would have brought up Dark's ballooning body weight, a topic more sensitive than match-fixing. So go on and look to soO-FanTaSy or TY-SpeCial for your fanfic friendships\u2014there will be no love lost between Classic and Dark, no matter the outcome, and no matter the means of attaining victory in this match.Alright, here's the part where we read off of Aligulac.com so you don't have to. Dark leads Classic 10-4 in all-time offline matches (30-20 map score) , with Dark leading 3-2 in their high-stakes series from 2018 (WESG, Super Tournaments, Code S, the works!). Dark seems to have the statistical edge in recent form, with a 15\u20133 ZvP match record (46\u201326 map score) during the WCS 2019 cycle, while Classic trails with a 9\u20134 record in PvZ matches (20\u201314 map score) .Now here's the part where we talk about why none of that may matter. Sure, Dark seems to have the edge in terms of stats, but so did Rogue when he faced Classic in the RO8. However, Classic still managed to defeat Rogue by bringing five completely differently builds in every single game, which nudged him to a narrow 3-2 victory. Some of his galaxy-brain strategies backfired completely, like an Archon-Immortal drop with proxied Shield Batteries where the Batteries were discovered and destroyed before they could achieve anything. And yeah, he was also totally destroyed by Rogue in the late-game when he tried to safely snowball a mid-game advantage. But some of his stratagems caught Rogue completely off guard, like a delayed three-Templar drop which crippled the Zerg economy at a crucial timing. And, of course, we had to gawk in awe/horror at Classic's game one cannon rush, where he looked like the opponent Zergs fear most: Has with an actual ounce of finesse.On the surface, Dark fits a similar profile as Rogue: an incredible macro player who also possesses an incredible killer-instinct regarding when to go for cheese rushes. Rogue's downfall against Classic may have been his reluctance to go for cheeses at all, which allowed Classic to throw his macro-busting tactics against Rogue in game after game. While Classic could outsmart yet another defensive Zerg, he may fall to a player who is just as devious as him (I will peddle this theory about beating Classic until Zergs stop losing to his Glaive-Adept timings because they started pressing the \"R\" key 8 seconds too late). It's all in good fun until someone actually has to go to the army. Prediction While Classic expressed some concerns about having shown too many of his build orders against Rogue, I get the feeling that the sane scientist will find a way to develop mix-ups and mind-games based on the information Dark gleaned from the series vs Rogue. Dark could potentially take this series by playing it safe and defensive (Classic only won 3-2 vs Rogue, after all), but I'd like to see him play a mix of macro and all-in strategies to maximize his chance of victory. Also, I'd like to note that Dark dropped a map to a proxy FOUR-GATE RUSH against South Africa's Drager at WESG. I don't know how that matters in terms of this match, but I didn't have anywhere else to fit it. Anyway...

"title": "U.S. disaster aid won't cover crops drowned by Midwest floods", "text": "U.S. disaster aid won't cover crops drowned by Midwest floods Reuters 8 hrs ago By Tom Polansek\nMALVERN, Iowa, April 2 (Reuters) - The Black Hawk military helicopter flew over Iowa, giving a senior U.S. agriculture official and U.S. senator an eyeful of the flood damage below, where yellow corn from ruptured metal silos spilled out into the muddy water.\nAnd there's nothing the U.S. government can do about the millions of bushels of damaged crops here under current laws or disaster-aid programs, U.S. Agriculture Under Secretary Bill Northey told a Reuters reporter who joined the flight.\nThe USDA has no mechanism to compensate farmers for damaged crops in storage, Northey said, a problem never before seen on this scale. That's in part because U.S. farmers have never stored so much of their harvests, after years of oversupplied markets, low prices and the latest blow of lost sales from the U.S. trade war with China - previously their biggest buyer of soybean exports.\nThe USDA last year made $12 billion in aid available to farmers who suffered trade-war losses, without needing Congressional approval. The agency has separate programs that partially cover losses from cattle killed in natural disasters, compensate farmers who cannot plant crops due to weather, and help them remove debris left in fields after floods.\nBut it has no program to cover the catastrophic and largely uninsured stored-crop losses from the widespread flooding, triggered by the \"bomb cyclone\" that hit the region in mid-March. Congress would have to pass legislation to address the harvests lost in the storm, according to Northey and a USDA statement to Reuters.\n\"It's not traditionally been covered,\" he said. \"But we've not usually had as many losses.\"\nIndigo Ag, an agriculture technology company, identified 832 on-farm storage bins within flooded Midwest areas. They hold an estimated 5 million to 10 million bushels of corn and soybeans - worth between $17.3 million to $34.6 million - that could have been damaged in the floods, the company told Reuters.\nAcross the United States, farmers held soybean stocks of 2.716 billion bushels as of March 1, the largest on record for the time period, the USDA said on Friday. Corn stocks were the third-largest on record.\nSome Congress members have expressed interest in pursuing legislation to provide aid for damaged crops in storage, Northey said. But passing legislation could require a lengthy political process in the face of an urgent disaster, U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley told farmers at a meeting in Malvern, Iowa.\n\"If we have to pass a bill to do it, I hate to tell you how long that takes,\" said the senator from Iowa, who joined Northey on the helicopter tour.\nWith farm incomes declining for years before the flood, many farmers had planned to sell their grain in storage for money to live, pay their taxes or finance operations, including planting this spring.\nFrom the helicopter, piloted by National Guard members, officials surveyed miles of flooded fields in Iowa, littered with lawn chairs, fuel tanks, furniture, tires and other flood debris.\nFarmers will have to destroy any grains that were contaminated by floodwater, which could also prevent some growers from planting oversaturated fields.\nNear Crescent, Iowa, farmer Don Rief said the flood damaged more than 60,000 bushels of his grain, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. He tried to move the crops before the flood, but dirt roads were too soft from the storm to support trucks.\n\"We were just hurrying like hell,\" Rief said. \"Hopefully USDA will come in and minimize some of the damage.\"\nThe USDA does not have a program that covers flood-damaged grain because farmers have typically received more advance notice of rising waters, allowing them to move crops and limit losses, said Tom Vilsack, who ran the agency under former President Barack Obama.\nIn this case, floods inundated fields quickly after multiple levees failed when rain and melting snow filled the Missouri River and other waterways. The frozen ground was unable to soak up the water.\nNear Percival, Iowa, railroad tracks leading up to a grain facility were flooded and broken. A Deere & Co dealership, Wendy's restaurant, Motel 6 and gas station nearby were also underwater, along with homes, cars and farm equipment.\nSome farmers moved machinery such as tractors on to highways to keep it out of the path of the floods. The equipment was still parked there during the flyover on Friday.\n\u00a9 Tom Polansek/ REUTERS Farmer Don Rief, talks with USDA Under Secretary Bill Northey about the flood damage to his farm in Crescent, Iowa, U.S., March 29, 2019. Photo taken March 29, 2019. REUTERS/Tom Polansek\nAbout 416,000 acres of cropland across six counties in Iowa were flooded, said Amanda De Jong, state executive director for the USDA Iowa Farm Service Agency.\nOf that, about 309,000 acres will be eligible for the federal program that helps farmers and ranchers remove debris left by natural disasters on farmlands, De Jong said last week. She estimated the program would need about $34 million to clean up the fields.\nIowa's agriculture secretary Mike Naig said the U.S. government also should help compensate farmers for some of the grain that was damaged.\n\"This is clearly a gap that we think needs to be addressed,\" said Naig, who accompanied Grassley and Northey in the chopper.\nTime is short for a solution, said Carol Vinton, supervisor of Mills County, Iowa, one of the state's two most heavily damaged counties.\nVinton said she was getting calls from farmers whose grain was damaged and are worried about making good on previously signed contracts to deliver those crops to elevators.\nThe USDA wants to do everything it can to help farmers hurt by the disaster, Northey said.\n\"They spent all last year raising that crop, putting it in the bin and they maybe already have it marketed,\" he said. \"And now they're going to have to spend time just to get rid of it - just to clean the place up.\"\n(Reporting by Tom Polansek in Malvern, Iowa.

Convective weather is typically short-lived as well: Some events may last for only a few minutes.\nAs of the end of March, southern China had been stricken this year by seven convective weather events affecting two or more provincial regions, according to Chen Tao, a chief forecaster at the center.\n\"Generally speaking, there are slightly more of the weather events this year, which also came a little bit earlier,\" he said, adding that it's hard to forecast the frequency of devastating events.\nMore of the extreme weather, however, is on the way. Brief, strong rainfall, with hourly precipitation of 20 to 40 mm was expected to occur in some areas in five provincial regions, including Guizhou, Yunnan and Hainan provinces from 2 pm Monday to 8 am Tuesday, and some areas in these regions will also experience thunderstorms, with strong winds and hail.\nTwo more events are expected to occur in the southern parts of China from Tuesday to Thursday, and from March 8 to 10. The eastern part of Guizhou will be affected by both events forecasters said.\nBrief, strong winds and rain in a convective weather event can be as strong as in the eyes of super typhoons and may take down buildings of sink vessels. The local strength of a super tornado generated by convection can be far beyond that of the strongest typhoon, Chen said.\nIn convective weather, temperatures in the upper air mass usually lag behind that of lower, moist air, creating strong, upwelling air currents. Spring is high season for convective weather in China, he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations":

it okay for the U.S. government to pay for scientific experiments involving bizarre mouse/human hybrid creatures that were created by grafting aborted baby parts on to mice? Needless to say, the answer to that question is self-evident. Our tax dollars are being used to fund experiments that are so sickening that it is difficult to find words to describe how evil they are. What you are about to read is deeply unsettling, but we must get the word out about this, because most Americans have no idea that this is happening. And we must do everything in our power to stop this, because there is no future for any nation that engages in this sort of extreme evil.\nBy this point, most people know that Planned Parenthood sells aborted baby parts to the scientific community. But now we have learned that sickening experiments are being performed that involve fusing aborted baby parts on to mice. The following comes from a bombshell report by the Sun \u2026\nABORTED babies are being used in macabre experiments in the US that involve grafting dead fetus parts onto mice which are then used to test drugs.\nDocuments seen by Sun Online outline procedures that involve cutting out glands and livers of unborn children and then fusing them onto lab rodents.\nAs a result of these experiments, the \u201chumanized mice\u201d actually develop \u201chuman-like immunity\u201d. This is how it works \u2026\nA so-called \u201chumanised mouse\u201d is created by first destroying a rodents immune system by subjecting it to radiation.\nLivers or the thymus glands are then fused with them.\nIn about 10 weeks the mice develop human-like immunity and are ready to be experimented on .\nThe federal government could outlaw such experiments, but that has not happened.\nInstead, the federal government has actually been pouring millions of dollars into such research \u2026\nThe controversial use of body parts is being spearheaded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is part of the American government which is ploughing $98million (\u00a375m) of taxpayers\u2019 money into using aborted babies in the name of science .\nBut addressing Congress in December, NIH director Francis Collins defended the practice.\nHe said: \u201cThere is strong evidence that scientific benefits come from fetal tissue research, [which] can be done with an ethical framework.\u201d\nFrancis Collins is an absolute disgrace, and he should immediately be fired and banned from ever working for the government again.\nOf course now that the Democrats control the U.S. House of Representatives, Congress is not going to ban these experiments.\nBut the Republicans had control of both houses of Congress for two years, and they did nothing. This is why we need a new generation of conservative leaders in Congress .\nThankfully, we have a president that is starting to make pro-life issues a more central part of his agenda, and that was reflected in his State of the Union address \u2026\n\u201cThere could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother\u2019s womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cTo defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother\u2019s womb. Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children\u2014born and unborn\u2014are made in the holy image of God,\u201d Trump said.\nI honestly do not know how many of these radical pro-abortion leftists can look at themselves in the mirror.\nLegalizing abortion up to the moment of birth was not enough for some of them, and so now some activists have been pushing for \u201cpost-birth\u201d abortions.\nIn other words, they want to legalize infanticide.\nAnd why stop there? In the end, where will they ultimately decide to draw the line? In one of his recent articles, Mike Adams posed some very important questions \u2026\nWhat is the age after birth at which Democrats think murdering a child should no longer be allowed? Is post-birth \u201cabortion\u201d (murder) to be legalized up to 100 days? Two years? Five years? If it\u2019s a \u201cwoman\u2019s choice,\u201d then can\u2019t the woman make that choice at any age, according to the twisted logic of Leftists?\nWe are a nation that has already killed 60 million children, and if we keep doing this there will be no future for America.\nMore abortions are performed at Planned Parenthood than anywhere else, and the federal government gives Planned Parenthood approximately 500 million dollars every year.\nPlanned Parenthood sells aborted baby parts to the highest bidder, and those baby parts are being used in some of the sickest scientific experiments imaginable.\nIn addition to funding Planned Parenthood, the federal government also spends millions of dollars each year funding those experiments.\nAs you fill out your tax return this year, take a few moments to think about where those tax dollars are going.\nOur nation is doing things that are unspeakably evil, and the federal government is funding those practices every step of the way.\nSource: http://www.thesleuthjournal.com/aborted-baby-parts-are-being-grafted-on-to-mice-in-bizarre-scientific-experiments-and-the-u-s-government-is-paying-for-it/", "highlightText": "",

And even though stock prices have been rising, the numbers for the \u201creal economy\u201d have been depressingly bad lately. But what we didn\u2019t have was official confirmation from the Federal Reserve that the economy is really slowing down, but now we do. According to the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow model, the economy is growing \u201cat a 0.3 percent annualized rate in the first quarter\u201d \u2026\nThe U.S. economy is growing at a 0.3 percent annualized rate in the first quarter , based on data on domestic construction spending in December released on Monday, the Atlanta Federal Reserve\u2019s GDPNow forecast model showed.\nFor years, the goal has been to get U.S. growth above the key 3 percent threshold, but what this forecast is telling us is that economic growth is currently at one-tenth of that level.\nThat is just barely above recession territory.\nSo when I say that we are teetering on the brink of a recession, I am not exaggerating.\nWe also just got some really bad news about construction spending \u2026\nConstruction spending fell 0.6% in December from November, based on a seasonally adjusted annual rate, released today by the Commerce Department. Compared to December a year earlier, total construction spending inched up only 0.8% ( not seasonally adjusted ), the lowest growth rate since Oct 2011, coming out of the great recession.\nNow we can add that to the list of all the other numbers that are telling us that very rough times are ahead.\nMeanwhile, debt levels in the U.S. just continue to explode.\nAccording to the latest report, Americans now have 480 million credit cards . That is about 100 million more than during the last recession.\nIn other words, there are about 1.5 credit cards for every man, woman and child in the entire country.\nThe total amount of credit card debt in the United States has now reached a whopping $870,000,000,000 . That number has never been higher in the history of our nation.\nAnd when you total up all forms of individual debt, U.S. consumers are now 13.5 trillion dollars in the hole.\nCorporate debt levels are exploding as well, and this is something that Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan warned about on Tuesday \u2026\nU.S. nonfinancial corporate debt consists mostly of bonds and loans. This category of debt, as a percentage of gross domestic product, is now higher than in the prior peak reached at the end of 2008 , Kaplan said.\nA number of studies have concluded this level of credit could \u201cpotentially amplify the severity of a recession,\u201d he noted.\nThe lowest level of investment-grade debt, BBB bonds, has grown from $800 million to $2.7 trillion by year-end 2018. High-yield debt has grown from $700 million to $1.1 trillion over the same period. This trend has been accompanied by more relaxed bond and loan covenants, he added.\nOverall, corporate debt has more than doubled since the last financial crisis, and that is just one of the reasons why our financial system is far more vulnerable today than it was just before the last financial crisis.\nThis week we also learned that the federal budget deficit is exploding as well. The following comes from Business Insider \u2026\nAccording to a report from the Treasury Department released Tuesday, the budget deficit \u2014 that is the difference between what the federal government takes in and what it spends \u2014 hit $310 billion in the first four months of fiscal year 2019 .\nFiscal years for the federal government run October through September, so the data reflects the shortfall from October 2018 through January 2019. Based on the data, the deficit increased by 77% compared to the same period the prior year .\nA 77 percent increase in one year?\nI don\u2019t even have the words to describe how foolish this is.\nWe are on pace to add way over a trillion dollars to the national debt this year, and one of the big things fueling this horrific debt binge is our rapidly expanding interest payments \u2026\nFinally, and perhaps most concerning, is that for the first four months of this fiscal year, interest payments on the U.S. national debt hit $192 billion, $17 billion, or 10% more than in the same four-month period last year and the most interest ever paid in the first third of the fiscal year . As Reuters\u2019 Jeoff Hall points out, annualizing the $192BN interest expense means that the interest on U.S. public debt is on track to reach a record $575 billion this fiscal year, more than the entire budget deficit in FY 2014 ($483 BN) or FY 2015 ($439 BN), and equates to 2.7% of estimated GDP, the highest percentage since 2011.\nBut according to the proponents of modern monetary theory (MMT), we can spend as much money as we want because \u201cdeficits almost never matter\u201d \u2026\nBecause MMT holds that government spending isn\u2019t funded by taxes, the Green New Deal doesn\u2019t include any measures to finance the very large, open-ended fiscal commitments it would undertake. According to MMT economists, the only possible danger from the resultant government debt would be inflation, which can usually be controlled with tools other than raising taxes. In other words, deficits almost never matter. So confident are they of their theory\u2019s universal applicability that MMT proponents often respond to their critics with scorn.\nIf you can believe it, there are actually members of Congress that believe this stuff. Of course the truth is that our national debt is an existential threat to the continued existence of our nation, and this is a point that I have made repeatedly .\nThe U.S. economy was in far better shape just prior to the financial crisis of 2008 than it is now, and today we are drowning in far more debt than we were at that time.\nThe stage is set for the most terrifying economic horror show in American history, and the clock is ticking away with each passing day.\nSource:

Rather it's the open-source platform on which it's built\u2014 Stellar Lumens , the ninth most popular cryptocurrency by market cap.\nJesse Lund, head of IBM's blockchain division praises the payments and settlement network saying it cements the tech giant's leadership in the blockchain technology space. He characterizes the development of World Wire, which is now being used by six international banks including Philippines-based RCBC, South Korea's Bank Busan and Brazil's Banco Bradesco as:\n\u201cWe\u2019re building on a new idea, which is to be able to store monetary value electronically and be able to move that value around the world in real time\u2026 I think the problem with cross-border payments today, the inefficiencies are based on the fact that the way that banks communicate, the network that banks communicate on is separate from the network or the rails that money actually moves on.\nMany would argue it's already possible to store monetary value electronically and move it around in real time. Banks are already virtual although the funds stored are not yet fully digital. Which means IBM may not really be doing anything groundbreaking here.\nThat is, unless you consider Big Blue's use of Stellar. Until now, larger rival XRP , formerly known as Ripple, had been the banking industry choice. That's because, according to its developers, \"it enables secure, instant and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks.\" But, says Viabhav Kadikar, CEO of CloseCross , a decentralized market prediction platform, Steller is the preferred chain for micropayments, as it's relatively inexpensive:\n\u201cIBM has made an operational decision in choosing them [Stellar] as a network to build on. A considerable difference to the current virtual offering by banks is that the proposed flow of funds through World Wire will not require after the fact, cross border reconciliations to be carried out. This process normally involves a number of banks and even federal banks, so with World Wire they are proposing an overall increase in efficiency and transparency.\u201d\nThe way IBM portrays it, they're building a new backbone for banks, using blockchain, explains Alex Frenkel, VP of product at Kin Ecosystem. He stresses that blockchain technology is slower and harder to maintain than a conventional database. Its main virtue is in the direct exchange of value between people around the world.\n\u201cI'm not sure this is the most efficient way to improve the banking backbone,\" he adds. \"The real revolution with blockchain and crypto is removing the need to use banks for sending value across the world. In this vision, banks will have a completely different role in the financial world and will not deal with controlling and validating value exchanges between people.\u201d\nBreaking Banks Out of Their Comfort Zone\nMany banks, however, are still operating within their comfort zone, Kadikar points out.\n\"But partnering with a tech giant like IBM will [make them] feel more confident trialing new technology.\nLarge banks and corporates need to be in their comfort zone when they attempt to trial or utilize new tech. They need a partner that is solid, large and reliable based on previous experiences as well as something their regulators will accept.\u201d\nTo that end, the launch of IBM's World Wire is a good thing for the overall blockchain landscape, especially for the payments industry where the back-end functions can develop at scale in a blockchain environment without any user experience friction.\nThere is also a case to be made that transaction times and fees will drop with this latest launch. Gadi Srebnik, blockchain team lead at Kin Blockchain, which is a fork of Stellar Blockchain, believes that has serious benefits for the end consumer. \"Clients will gain as work\u2014and costs\u2014are reduced on the banking side,\u201d he says.\nPerhaps more important than the workflow and settlement efficiencies, IBM is setting the technology standard that all banks will need to meet going forward, Jehan Chu, co-founder of Social Alpha Foundation and managing partner of Kenetic points out.\n\u201cAs banks compete even harder, the near instant global settlement across their network will eventually become the new norm. IBM is signalling where the future of finance lies, and it\u2019s built on blockchain. Banks are moving from the electronic age to the digital age, with blockchain as it\u2019s connective tissue.\u201d\nIBM Surprises, Chooses Stellar Platform For New Payment Transfer Service", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.socialalphafoundation.org/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;ust%3D1553735488133000&sa=D&ust=1553735488141000&usg=AFQjCNFjVrMTIPjIWJlXxY0iK7jRUds6ug", "https://twitter.com/close_cross", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=179222828858436&u=https%3A%2F%2Fin.investing.com%2Fanalysis%2Fibm-surprises-chooses-stellar-platform-for-new-payment-transfer-service-200208497&display=popup&ref=plugin", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fin.investing.com%2Fanalysis%2Fibm-surprises-chooses-stellar-platform-for-new-payment-transfer-service-200208497&title=IBM+Surprises%2C+Chooses+Stellar+Platform+For+New+Payment+Transfer+Service&summary=", "https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/03/21/discussing-ibms-foray-into-blockchain-based-payment-systems.html?&qsearchterm=blockchain", "https://invst.ly/afrju"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jesse lund", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new payment transfer service", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ibm", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rcbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank busan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banco bradesco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international business machines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T12:22:56.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eaa842723fc4713a4c89337865d8547285eaafb7", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/asami122266", "site_full": "twitcasting.tv", "site": "twitcasting.tv", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["television", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "\u30a2\u30b5\u30df\u30f3@\u661f\u306e\u4eba\u2606\u5f61 (@asami122266) 's Live - TwitCasting", "title_full": "\u30a2\u30b5\u30df\u30f3@\u661f\u306e\u4eba\u2606\u5f61 (@asami122266) 's Live - TwitCasting", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://imagegw03.twitcasting.tv/image3/image.twitcasting.tv/image75_1/36/2f/1ff12f36-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2374, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eaa842723fc4713a4c89337865d8547285eaafb7", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/asami122266", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "\u30a2\u30b5\u30df\u30f3@\u661f\u306e\u4eba\u2606\u5f61 (@asami122266) 's Live - TwitCasting", "text": "Title of work being infringed Details\nI read and understand the following notes and send this form.

FOREX-Aussie weakens on central bank caution; U.S. dollar at three-week high * Aussie slides half a pct after RBA\n* Euro hits more than three-week low as dollar gains\n* Sterling under pressure again on Brexit vote woes\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\nBy Tommy Wilkes\nLONDON, April 2 (Reuters) - Australia&apos;s dollar shed half a percent on Tuesday as investors focused on the central bank&apos;s caution about the health of the global economy. The U.S. dollar rose to a three-week high.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia has left interest rates unchanged and avoided the outright dovish tone of some other central banks, but traders still treated its policy statement as bad for the currency.\nThe RBA&apos;s stress on the \"downside risks for the global growth environment\" probably caused the currency to weaken, said Commerzbank (DE: CBKG ) analyst Esther Reichelt.\nShe said the government&apos;s budget due on Tuesday should provide some supportive measures. Combined with optimism over China, she said, that should help the Aussie to rebound.\nAustralia&apos;s dollar dropped 0.6 percent to $0.7072 AUD=D3 .\nThe euro, which has also been weakened by a dovish central bank, fell 0.2 percent to $1.1196 EUR=EBS in London on Tuesday -- its weakest since March 8 -- as the U.S. dollar gained.\nThe dollar index , which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of rival currencies, rose 0.3 percent to 97.430 .DXY , a three-week high.\nSterling dropped half a percent after lawmakers rejected four Brexit proposals, heightening Britain&apos;s uncertainty just 10 days before it is due to leave the European Union. The pound was down at $1.3044 GBP=D3 and at 85.84 pence against the euro EURGBP=D3 .\nThe safe-haven Swiss franc held below 1.12 per euro and near 2019 highs. It traded 0.1 percent higher at 1.1186 EURCHF=EBS , below 2019 highs of 1.117.\nRBC Capital Markets strategist Adam Cole said he did not expect the franc to hold its gains because the Swiss National Bank remained \"sensitive\" to a stronger currency, particularly when it traded below 1.12 francs versus the euro.\nThe SNB will be \"the last central bank in the developed world to tighten rates,\" he said.\nCryptocurrencies surged. Bitcoin jumped 20 percent to touch $5,000, its highest since November BTC=BTSP .

EM ASIA FX-Asian currencies slip on higher U.S. bond yields, oil prices * Stronger dollar, bond yields steer funds away from Asia\n* Indian rupee, Philippine peso dented by oil import costs\n* South Korean won weakens as inflation rate slows (Adds details, updates prices)\nBy Ambar Warrick\nApril 2 (Reuters) - Emerging Asian currencies softened on Tuesday as optimism over the U.S. economy, along with a rise in the dollar and bond yields, increased investor interest in developed markets.\nCurrencies of countries with hefty oil imports, such as the Indian rupee INR=IN , Philippine peso PHP= and Indonesian rupiah IDR=ID , were also hurt by crude prices reaching a 2019 peak. O/R\nAsian markets had strengthened on Monday after encouraging China factory surveys hinted that domestic stimulus easing some of the pressure from its trade war with the U.S. Overnight, an uptick in American manufacturing data saw U.S. bond yields and the dollar .DXY move higher. USD/\nMizuho Bank&apos;s Vishnu Varathan said in a note that the positive data \"helped to assuage fears of a deep recession.\"\nBut he took a cautionary tone, adding \"the trouble with silver linings is that the clouds have yet to lift, even if bets mount on the sunshine behind. So EM Asia optimism may be measured, not manic.\"\nAt 0455 GMT Tuesday, the Chinese yuan CNY=CFXS was down about 0.12 percent to the dollar. The People&apos;s Bank of China set a slightly weaker mid-point for the day, compared to Monday&apos;s close. The yuan has gained about 2.3 percent this year. CNY/\nThe Indonesian rupiah weakened 0.11 percent against the dollar. While a spike in oil prices usually hurts the rupiah, given the country&apos;s large oil bill, there has been encouraging economic data recently, including February&apos;s surprise trade surplus and a March inflation rate below the Indonesian central bank&apos;s target. South Korean won KRW=KFTC declined 0.29 percent versus the dollar, as inflation for March slowed to its weakest pace since July 2016. Korea&apos;s central bank chief on Monday clarified that it was not in a hurry to ease policy further, contrary to expectations in the bond market. RUPEE, PHILIPPINE PESO\nOil prices LCoc1 were spurred by demand prospects and supply disruptions to their highest since November 2018.\nThe Indian rupee INR=IN fell about 0.20 percent and the Philippine peso PHP= declined 0.25 percent.\nBoth currencies are especially sensitive to oil prices given their vast current account deficits, a large portion of which comes from oil imports.\nVoting in Indian elections begins this month and a budget impasse in the Philippines are expected to weigh on the respective currencies in the near-term.\nThe following table shows rates for Asian currencies against the dollar as at 0455 GMT.

Economists forecast that core durable goods orders will rise 0.3% on the month, reversing the 0.2% declines from January. Economists forecast that headline durable goods orders will fall 1.1% on the month in February. In the previous month, durable goods orders rose 0.3%. In January, they were initially reported to have increased by 0.4%, but this was revised down to show a 0.3% increase. Although the data does not have a big impact on the USD markets, it will certainly bring some volatility to them. The durable goods orders report gives an estimate of the trends in the economy.\nThe Census Bureau releases the report on a monthly basis. It measures the amount of new long-lasting orders placed with manufacturers. Durable Goods Orders \u2013 Where We Are\nDurable goods orders have been steadily rising over the previous few months. Data for January saw the biggest increase since the summer of 2018. Official data released a few weeks ago revealed that orders rose 0.3% in January. US Durable Goods Orders US Durable Goods Orders, January 2019\nExcluding transportation, orders fell 0.1% due to declines in cars and truck order bookings. The increase in orders came from rising demand for machinery, commercial aircraft, and transportation equipment. There was a decline of 1% in autos and auto parts and industrial metals and computers. The core durable goods orders fell 0.2% in January. Can Durable Goods Orders Maintain the Trend in February?\nThe data for February which comes out this week has a somewhat mixed forecast. However, there is scope for an upside surprise in the report. The recent capital goods orders report which feeds into the durable goods orders data rebounded in February. Shipments surged after falling for two consecutive months. The rebound in capital goods tempered speculation about a sharp slowdown in the US economy. New orders for non-defense spending rose 1.8% in February. The gains were the highest in five months and follow a downward revision to the previous month\u2019s data.\nCore capital goods shipments rose 1.4% during February which was the biggest advance since December 2016, according to sources. This followed January\u2019s revision to a 0.1% gain.\nOrders for machinery rose 1.6% on the month with demand for new orders increased in other sectors such as electrical equipment, appliances, and components. Orders for computers continued to fall in February. The overall surge in capital goods orders could indicate that the durable goods orders report could spring an upside surprise. This comes amid an increase in demand for motor vehicle parts which fell 1.6% in January. Durable Goods and Q1 GDP Forecasts\nIf the durable goods orders report surprises to the upside, this could mark another month of solid gains in investment and spending. This, in turn, will prompt GDP watchers to raise their expectations for the first quarter GDP figures. At the time of writing, various GDP tracking tools indicate a median range of 1.3% \u2013 1.7% for Q1 2019. There is a possibility that the expectations will rise on the back of a strong durable goods orders report.\nStill, the GDP growth rate for the first quarter will remain weak comparing to the fourth quarter GDP numbers in 2018. The US economy is forecast to grow at a slower pace in the coming months. The Fed has also stopped its plans to hike rates for the remainder of the year. The central bank has also paused its balance sheet unwinding program as well, due to concerns of weak inflation and slower economic growth. Trading the Durable Goods Orders Report for February\nA surprise to the upside will no doubt see the USD being bid higher. A positive report will keep the USD to the upside as investor concerns of a slowdown or a recession will ease. The forecasts already signal a negative report. If the actual data does indeed come in negative as expected, the USD is unlikely to see any big moves as investors already discount this news.

It also insists on buying a Russian air defense missile system that could shoot that warplane down. The U.S. says the NATO ally can't have both.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\nThe United States says it is time for Turkey to choose - choose between America and Russia. Turkey is a NATO ally. It's buying a vital U.S. weapon system - the F-35 stealth jet fighter. And by purchasing some of those planes - two of them to be exact - Turkey helps to cover the enormous cost of development. But Turkey also plans to buy missiles from Russia. And the U.S. now says, drop the Russian purchase or lose the U.S. planes. NPR's David Welna reports.\nDAVID WELNA, BYLINE: At Luke Air Force Base just outside Phoenix, a jet engine blasts the world's most advanced stealth fighter and its pilot up into the sky. It's one of 84 F-35s at Luke. Two of them have the flag of Turkey painted on their tails. They're the only F-35s here I'm not allowed to photograph. Sean Clements is Luke's chief of media relations. He says from the highest levels of the Pentagon, the order is no pictures of these two fighter jets, no interviews with the Turkish pilots training here.\nSEAN CLEMENTS: The decision was made not for this instance specifically but just a blanket across the board that Turkey doesn't do interviews. They don't do media opportunities.\nWELNA: They don't have their plane photographed.\nCLEMENTS: Exactly.\nWELNA: And yet, nine months ago, these two war planes were unveiled with great fanfare by Lockheed Martin, which manufactures the F-35.\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ISTIKLAL MARSI\")\nUNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing in Turkish).\nWELNA: Turkey's national anthem opened the ceremony in Fort Worth, Texas. Lockheed's CEO Marillyn Hewson then symbolically delivered the first two of the hundred F-35s that Turkey plans to buy.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nMARILLYN HEWSON: At Lockheed Martin, our hope is that the F-35 will continue to strengthen the mission and values of NATO, our relationship with Turkey and the cause of peace in the region and around the world.\nWELNA: But Turkey has yet to take actual custody of these two planes, which cost $100 million apiece. American pilots flew them to Luke, where the Turkish pilots have been training. But it's not clear those planes will ever reach Turkey. That's because Turkey's also buying Russia's advanced S-400 air defense missile system. Here's the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Joe Dunford, last month, warning that Turkey should not do that.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nJOE DUNFORD: I think both the executive branch of our government, the legislative branch of our government are going to have a hard time reconciling the presence of the S-400 and the most advanced fighter aircraft that we have, the F-35.\nWELNA: Pentagon officials say Russia's installing the S-400 in Turkey could give Moscow easy access to the stealth fighter's secrets. NATO's Supreme Allied Commander General Curtis Scaparrotti recently told Congress that if Turkey does acquire Russia's S-400 system...\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nCURTIS SCAPARROTTI: My best military advice would be that we don't then follow through with the F-35, flying it or working with an ally that's working with Russian systems, particularly air defense systems.\nWELNA: But denying Turkey the F-35 is not so simple. Turkey's part of a nine-nation consortium building the jet fighter. And it makes hundreds of its components. That's why Loren Thompson, an arms expert whose Lexington Institute receives funding from Lockheed Martin, doubts Turkey will get kicked out.\nLOREN THOMPSON: Turkey was on board the F-35 program from day one. And therefore, all of the program plans assume that it will continue to play its role going forward in the construction and the support of the aircraft.\nWELNA: Excluding Turkey from the F-35 is clearly not what American officials would like to do. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan was categorical at a House Armed Services Committee hearing last week when asked about that by Ohio Republican Michael Turner.\n(SOUNDBITE OF HEARING)\nMICHAEL TURNER: Do we want Turkey in the F-35 program?\nPATRICK SHANAHAN: We absolutely do. We need Turkey to buy the Patriot.\nWELNA: Shanahan was referring to the Patriot missile defense system, which the U.S. offered to sell to Turkey earlier this year as an alternative to the Russian system. That sale is conditioned, though, on Turkey abandoning plans to install the S-400. So far, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is showing no signs of backing down.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nPRESIDENT RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN: (Speaking Turkish).\nWELNA: In an interview last week on Turkish TV, Erdogan said Turkey's already made its move on the S-400. And there's no turning back. In his words, nobody should ask us to lick up what we spat.\nASLI AYDINTASBAS: This is a very rocky relationship.\nWELNA: That's Istanbul-based Asli Aydintasbas. She's a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. And she says via Skype that while campaigning for local elections, Erdogan has showcased his defiance in this standoff.\nAYDINTASBAS: Each and every rally he brings up S-400s saying, we're going to buy it. They told me not to buy it, almost making it look like it's a sign of his virile (ph) - his independence, his power on the world stage, etc., that he could say no to United States.\nWELNA: Erdogan, says former U.S. ambassador to Turkey Eric Edelman, is betting the Trump administration will blink.\nERIC EDELMAN: I think he might very well gamble that the United States would not actually kick Turkey out of the F-35 program because they are a partner in it. And there will be some definite costs to the United States, both in financial terms and in terms of the program.\nWELNA: Turkey's acquisition of the Russian air defense system could also trigger U.S. sanctions. Brian Egan was the National Security Council legal adviser during the Obama administration. What's on the line here, he says, is Washington's credibility.\nBRIAN EGAN: This seems to be squarely within the scope of what these sanctions were intended to address. And it does seem like a test case that others will be watching.\nWELNA: For the U.S., a lot more's at stake than the $12 billion worth of F-35s that Turkey plans to buy. American warplanes use Turkish bases to fly into neighboring Syria. U.S. nuclear warheads are known to be stockpiled in Turkey.\nJAMES STAVRIDIS: There are bad choices on both sides here, both for the U.S. and for Turkey.\nWELNA: Retired Admiral James Stavridis is a former NATO supreme allied commander. Something, he says, will have to give.\nSTAVRIDIS: So far, neither side is blinking. Let's hope the two sides can come together and hammer out some kind of a compromise that does not end up with S-400 missiles attached to NATO air defenses because that would compromise NATO air defenses.\nWELNA: A bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation last week prohibiting any transfer of F-35s to Turkey unless the Trump administration certifies Turkey won't be getting the S-400. But Turkish officials say that Russian missile defense system will be installed in July, risking the fate not just of Turkey's two F-35s at that Luke and dozens more on order but its standing as a trusted NATO ally as well.\nDavid Welna, NPR News, Luke Air Force Base, Ariz.\n(SOUNDBITE OF CAVES OF STEEL'S \"MAGIC SMOKE OUT\")\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

The U.S. is \"slow-walking\" the admissions process for refugees, according to national security experts and refugee advocacy groups, and the numbers appear to back that up.\nAt the halfway point of the U.S. government's fiscal year, President Donald Trump's administration has admitted fewer than half of the total number of refugees it said it would, already the lowest cap in the refugee program's history.\nNational security experts and refugee advocacy groups warn that the administration is still slow-walking the admissions process, which damages American credibility and leadership abroad.\nBut immigration hardliners have praised Trump for all but eliminating the program.\nAccording to a review of the latest publicly available data, the U.S. has taken in 12,099 refugees since Oct. 1. That's fewer than half of the 30,000 cap the administration committed to last fall, even at a time of historically high levels of refugees and displaced persons.\nAt the current pace, the U.S. would admit around 25,000 by fiscal year's end, actually an increase from last year's processing of 22,491 refugees, the second-lowest sum in the program's nearly 45-year history.\nBut it pales in comparison to the average figure under previous administrations, both Republican and Democrat, which averaged 78,865. And while previous presidents of both parties largely met admission targets, a State Department spokesperson told ABC News the Trump administration is no longer committed to doing so.\n\"This number is not a target, but an upper limit,\" said the spokesperson, who spoke on condition of anonymity because it is department policy.\nThe spokesperson also downplayed the halfway point as a poor representation of whether the administration will reach 30,000, saying that admissions \"rarely proceed at a steady pace throughout the year. It is premature to predict the number of refugees who will ultimately be admitted.\"\nGlobally, the number of refugees and displaced persons remained at historic highs in 2018. There were 68.5 million displaced people, including 25.4 million refugees, according to the latest data available from the United Nations.\nSome countries hit hardest by the violence and turmoil, forcing people to flee, are among those from which the U.S. has admitted the fewest refugees. Since Oct. 1, the U.S. has admitted 218 Syrian refugees, 216 Afghans and 168 Iraqis, including nine Yezidis who are persecuted for their identity.\nAfter his presidential campaign advocated for barring all refugees, Trump initially did so for 90 days in his first travel ban executive order that also blocked visas from seven Muslim majority-countries. After legal battles, a version of the temporary refugee ban was allowed to take effect, and once it expired, the administration announced extended restrictions on the very countries from which the majority of refugees come.\nNow, those restrictions are no longer in place, but all refugees undergo additional background processes that advocates have said are unnecessary and designed to waste time.\n\"They have added additional bureaucracy. ... There's been a lot of unnecessary bureaucratic delays,\" said Jenny Yang, vice president of advocacy and policy at World Relief, a Christian humanitarian organization that helps resettle refugees in the U.S. \"At a time when the administration could be leading the world in our humanitarian response, which has traditionally been a bipartisan effort, they are slow-walking the program.\"\nThat has international implications, some experts warn, as other countries mimic the U.S. and admit fewer refugees. Globally, refugee admissions are down 50%, per World Relief, and U.S. partners including Lebanon have been increasingly advocating for their refugee populations to return home.\nBut for many, including Syrians, Afghans, and the Rohingya refugees fleeing ethnic cleansing in Myanmar, ongoing conflicts in their home countries prevent a safe and voluntary return.\nAs these vulnerable populations live for years in refugee camps, national security experts warn, they become more susceptible to radicalization, and any strain put on host countries to sustain them can become spark violent backlash or destabilize regions.\nThe Trump administration has been accused of working to dismantle the U.S. refugee admissions program, first by setting increasingly lower caps but more recently by proposing in its fiscal 2020 budget to strip the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, or PRM, of certain funds and authorities.\n\"America's stellar record in dealing with refugee and other displacement issues has for many decades depended on the fusion of the State Department's diplomatic and humanitarian arms, with PRM playing a key role,\" said Gene Dewey, who served as George W. Bush's assistant secretary for population, refugees and migration. \"This bad proposal would sacrifice this winning combination for no good reason.\"\nDewey was one of more than 50 former U.S. foreign policy officials who signed a letter to Congress urging it to block the move, as well as the budget proposal's cuts to humanitarian aid. The State Department has said the changes are \"to try to replace outdated, fragmented structures,\" as Eric Ueland, Director of the Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance, said.\nThe Assistant Secretary for PRM position has been vacant for the entirety of the Trump administration. Last May, the White House nominated Dr. Ronald Mortensen for the role, which drew fierce criticism because of his hard-line views on immigration and disparaging comments about immigrants and Republicans who've voted for immigration reform.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://abcnews.go.com/", "https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/donald-trump", "https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/refugees", "https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/nsa", "https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/immigration"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leah millis/reuters mehrad ansari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "abc news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "u.s. supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T13:00:29.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2835812ba631063f9e009116a255b614ee01a335", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/k_y_0_", "site_full": "twitcasting.tv", "site": "twitcasting.tv", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["television", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "\u3086\u304d\u306e (@k_y_0_) 's Live - TwitCasting", "title_full": "\u3086\u304d\u306e (@k_y_0_) 's Live - TwitCasting", "published": "2019-03-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://imagegw03.twitcasting.tv/image3/image.twitcasting.tv/image77_1/cc/4b/1ff14bcc-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2374, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2835812ba631063f9e009116a255b614ee01a335", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/k_y_0_", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-03-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "\u3086\u304d\u306e (@k_y_0_) 's Live - TwitCasting", "text": "Title of work being infringed Details\nI read and understand the following notes and send this form.

Turkey has only received one unit of the fifth-generation fighter thus far, but all current and future shipments of equipment related to the aircraft have been halted, Pentagon said, unless Ankara gives up its commitment to take delivery of a Russian S-400 missile defense system, RT reported. A NATO ally of the US, Turkey was planning on ordering 100 F-35s, and had signed on to produce fuselage and other components for the next-generation aircraft. However, US lawmakers moved to exclude Ankara from the program, fearing Turkey\u2019s planned purchase of the Russian-made S-400 air defense system could give the Russian system opportunity to learn how to track and spot the jet. US President Donald Trump signed a bill last year blocking the transfer of F-35s to Turkey, but the F-35 Joint Program Office announced that it would execute the transfer according to existing plans. Four US Senators introduced another bipartisan bill last week to prohibit the transfer until Ankara agrees to abandon the S-400 deal. At present, the deal remains on the table. \"The contract with Russia on S-400s remains in force and these defensive systems will be delivered to Turkey. Now talks on this issue are underway,\" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu stated on Friday, according to Russian news agency TASS. The first of four S-400 batteries will be delivered to Turkey this July. Washington has thus far failed to woo its NATO ally away from the Russian system and to Raytheon\u2019s more expensive Patriot system. Turkey has been a vital partner in the F-35 program, which itself has been plagued by cost overruns, delays and performance issues while being the US military's most expensive project to date. Turkey has been making parts of fuselage, landing gear and cockpit displays for the jets and has invested some $1.25 billion in the trillion-dollar program. Despite Ankara\u2019s integral role, US officials told Reuters last week that Washington can press ahead without the Turkish components, although doing so will drive the cost of the project up further. The first F-35 jet was delivered to Turkey in a ceremony in Texas in June. Throughout the dispute, Turkish pilots have been training on the F-35 at an airbase in Arizona since last July.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "f-35 joint program office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tehran", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T13:24:37.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7ba099599df63fb6eee9b0fb74eeab98e70014e2", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/rinostrawberry7", "site_full": "twitcasting.tv", "site": "twitcasting.tv", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["television", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "\u6817\u6816\u91ce\u2605Rino@4\u67087\u65e5\u307e\u3067\u8a9e\u5c3e\u30cb\u30e3\u30f3 (@Rinostrawberry7) 's Live - TwitCasting", "title_full": "\u6817\u6816\u91ce\u2605Rino@4\u67087\u65e5\u307e\u3067\u8a9e\u5c3e\u30cb\u30e3\u30f3 (@Rinostrawberry7) 's Live - TwitCasting", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://imagegw03.twitcasting.tv/image3/image.twitcasting.tv/image76_1/82/58/1ff15882-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2374, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7ba099599df63fb6eee9b0fb74eeab98e70014e2", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/rinostrawberry7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "\u6817\u6816\u91ce\u2605Rino@4\u67087\u65e5\u307e\u3067\u8a9e\u5c3e\u30cb\u30e3\u30f3 (@Rinostrawberry7) 's Live - TwitCasting", "text": "Title of work being infringed Details\nI read and understand the following notes and send this form.

Members of the United States women's soccer squad (USWNT) have told Reuters their lawsuit against the national federation alleging gender discrimination is not just about wages but also improving the sport for women participating in it at all levels.\nAll 28 members of the squad were named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court last month and says the women are not paid the same as their male counterparts.\nWhile the U.S. men's team have voiced their support, the U.S. Soccer Federation has said it was surprised by the lawsuit, with its president, Carlos Cordeiro, saying it strives for equal pay and has boosted its investment in female player development programs.\nMidfielder Megan Rapinoe told Reuters in an interview timed with Equal Pay Day on April 2 that they were also pushing for systematic change.\n\\\"For us it is really important to really look at the bigger picture of the compensation piece,\\\" she said.\n\\\"I don't think you can talk about compensation articulately or intelligently until you have a conversation about funding across the board,\\\" she said.\n\\\"So whether that is youth teams or staffing for each team or promotion and sponsorship, you know, advertising for both teams, I don't think that that is equal yet,\\\" she said.\n\\\"So yes we are fighting for equal compensation but we are also fighting for this larger picture of investment in both programs equally.\\\"\nSince the lawsuit was filed, some companies have stepped in to help close the pay gap.\nNutrition snack company Luna Bar on Tuesday announced that it would give each member of the squad competing at the Women's World Cup a one-time payment of $31,250 -- the difference in the bonus paid to the men's World Cup squad.\nSportswear company Adidas has also said that if the USWNT win the Women's World Cup this year its sponsored players would receive the same performance bonus payments as their male counterparts.\n'FLAWED SYSTEM'\nThe players said change was also needed outside the United States.\n\\\"We are hopeful that FIFA is doing things to put more women in executive positions and more women within FIFA in general,\\\" striker Alex Morgan told Reuters.\n\\\"We still feel like they are very behind on the trend and we are hopeful that what we are doing today and the continual fight that we have will help FIFA proactively change the inner workings of the system that is very flawed within them as well.\\\"\nMorgan said the team hoped to improve the lives of the next generation of female athletes.\n\\\"I think we realise the opportunity we have and the resources we have are due to the generation before us and we hope to increase those opportunities and resources available for the generation after us,\\\" she said.\n\\\"We might not see equal pay among athletes within our generation but the hope is that the future generations will.\\\"\nThe women said the lawsuit would not distract them from their efforts to win back-to-back World Cups, and a fourth title overall, when they compete in France in June.\n\\\"Success for us is very simple and it is very clear from the first second that you get on the team, whether it is like a passing pattern or a small-sided game or a friendly or a World Cup final -- it's winning,\\\" Rapinoe said.\n\\\"It's competing to the best of your ability, it's trying to be the absolute best that you can so for us the expectation is always the same, success for us looks like winning,\\\" she said.\n\\\"It looks like winning the World Cup.\\\"\n(Editing by Peter Rutherford)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "carlos cordeiro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "megan rapinoe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "u.s. soccer federation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T13:52:41.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "45cda0827fa3fa2000d99f23f441d77d831a3cc6", "url": "http://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2019/04/02/germany-like-us-thinks-russia-has-violated-nuclear-arms-treaty--merkel/", "site_full": "www.thestar.com.my", "site": "thestar.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Latest/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Malaysia News: National, Regional and World News | The Star Online", "title": "Germany, like U.S., thinks Russia has violated nuclear arms treaty -

The departure for Google's vice president for India and South East Asia would pull the curtains off an eight year long stint.\nIn a note, Scott Beaumont, President for Google Asia Pacific has been quoted saying, \"We are grateful to Rajan for his huge contribution to Google over the past eight years. His entrepreneurial zeal and leadership has helped grow the overall internet ecosystem in India and Southeast Asia, and we wish him all the best in his new adventures.\"\nAnandan's career with Google began in 2010. Besides Google, he has also worked with Microsoft, Dell India and McKinsey & Company. Anandan, is also a prolific angel investor in the country and is a member of the Indian Angel network. Some of his investments include WebEngage, Instamojo, Capillary Technologies, TravelKhana, and EasyGov.\nIn July 2016, Anandan had backed BOV Capital, touted to be Sri Lanka's first early-stage venture capital fund. It had launched a maiden Rs 100-crore early-stage fund to invest in technology-focused startups from Sri Lanka.\nAnandan, is expected to stay until the end of the month. With his exit, Google has pulled Vikas Agnihotri, the current Director for Sales to serve the interim responsibility.

Comparative feasibility of the EV will then lead to its induction in the police force for six months, before a final decision is made to purchase more electric cars or not, as per city officials. As for the EV in consideration here, the pre-owned Tesla Model S already has 22,000 miles (around 35,400 kms) on its odometer.

This is not the first time that Tesla vehicles are being used in a police department\u2019s patrolling fleet. Only last month, Fremont Police Department in the San Francisco bay area debuted its Tesla Model S patrol car. The Los Angeles Police Department and Denver Colorado Police Department have been a step ahead, having had Tesla Model S vehicles in their fleets for a few years now. The notion here is simple. Electric cars denote the future of patrolling fleets in more than one way. They are efficient, both in terms of speed, performance as well as maintenance. As a part of a department that always needs to be on its toes, such enhanced efficiency can profit multi-fold, all while contributing to the environment as well.

With cases wherein employees have been asked to update their Universal Account Number rising in recent times, this confusion has only increased multi-fold.\nThe Employee Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) in order to reduce such grievances has come out with a set of reforms.\nThe EPFO has asked its regional offices to provide EPF subscribers with an e-passbook and calculation sheets.\nThis, documented in the EPFO's latest circular dated March 22, aspires to offer working employees a hassle-free experience.\nEPFO in the circular said, \"In order to increase transparency in respect of provident fund settlement withdrawal and to reduce the confusion and grievances of the subscribers, it has been decided that calculation worksheet of provident fund withdrawal of each member is to be provided either on their registered mobile number or the email id provided in the claim form.\"\nIn order to get a copy of your passbook, you must have a few essentials in place.\nThe Universal Account Number (UAN) is one information that you must have handy. The UAN is a number that remains unique for all employees enrolled under EPF scheme. The number allotted by the EPFO remains active throughout life irrespective of the number of companies that one may have worked in his or her career.\nOne can also check the PF status on the Umang Application, available on Android Play Store and iOS. To do that, employees have to key in their UAN number in the EPFO\u2019s services page and an OTP (One-time Password) is sent to the employee's registered number.\nFollow these steps, if you are either unaware of your UAN or are confused: Visit the EPFIndia website. Click here to visit their site: Click on \u2018Know your UAN Status\u2019 on the bottom right of the page Select PF office state, Select PF office. Mention PF code, employee ID. Alternatively, you can mention Aadhaar number or PAN number Mention details like employee name, date of birth, mobile number and email-id. Press on 'Get Authorization PIN' On successful authorization, the system generates a PIN and sends that to your cell phone Upon successful authorization, the system shares the UAN number.\nOnce you have the UAN handy, getting the EPFO passbook is not a very difficult proposition. The EPFO passbook records employee\u2019s PF status and transactions.\nHere is how one can access the EPFO passbook: Visit EPFO website epfindia.gov.in. Click here to directly visit the link. Once you are on the website. Visit 'Our Services' tab and click on 'For Employees' option. On Services section, click on 'Member Passbook'. On the login page, enter the username which is the 12-digit Universal Account Number (UAN) and password to log in, after it has been activated. Employees can check UAN in the monthly salary slip Users can access E-passbook and even download and thereby set an option to print it. Users can also choose PF contributions from different companies. The passbook usually indicates the running balance in the account.

Senior Congress leader AK Antony, in a press conference announced the decision and said, \u201cIn a way it'll satisfy the requests of three southern states\u201d speaking to the geographical nature of Wayanad linking Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. A moment of pride for Kerala and South India. This historic decision will not only help oust communal and fascist forces, but also to bring India back to progress and harmony. Dear @RahulGandhi ji, welcome to Wayanad! pic.twitter.com/oidyHaBUpS \u2014 K C Venugopal (@kcvenugopalmp) March 31, 2019 Kerala has 20 Lok Sabha seats and this move has been met with criticism from the left. In 2014, Congress won 8 seats and this move is seen as a way to improve on their previous performance. South India is clearly a priority for the Congress. Electorally, it sends 130 MPs to the Lok Sabha and is certainly better placed than the BJP. However, the Indian Express editorial points out that this move shows a sign of weakness on the Congress\u2019 part \u2013 \u201c The choice of Wayanad, a so-called safe seat, is unlikely to have an impact beyond Kerala, where the Congress is contesting 16 seats. It is a telling comment on the Congress organisation that it needs to field a Gandhi to energise party workers and establish its national credentials vis a vis voters .\u201d Seeing this decision, CPI(M) member and former General Secretary Prakash Karat said, \u201cIt goes against Congress' national commitment to fight BJP\u2026their priority now is to fight against the Left in Kerala.\u201d The CPI(M) at its 21st party congress declared \u201cWhile the main direction of the struggle is against the BJP, the party will continue to oppose the Congress\u2026\u201d Their decision to align with the Congress in West Bengal in 2016 seemed to backfire for them as they lost the status of being the principal opposition in the state to the Congress. Does it make any sense for @RahulGandhi to contest from #Wayanad in a state where all 20 seats are in all probability going to vote for secular parties? Whats the political message here by @INCIndia and whose votes is it aiming to cut? \u2014 Sagarika Ghose (@sagarikaghose) March 31, 2019 With @RahulGandhi fighting the Left in Wayanad and spurning meaningful alliances in Delhi & elsewhere, Congress I believe has given up on 2019. It prefers the return of Modi or a weak nonBJP coalition to a strong nonBJP coalition it won't be able to dominate. So utterly suicidal. \u2014 Siddharth (@svaradarajan) March 31, 2019 In 2004, the CPI(M)-led Democratic Front won 18 out of 20 seats in Kerala. This was unprecedented, and at the time, the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) was the main political adversary. Contesting two seats could be an insurance policy, but also a way of expanding the map. In 2014, Rahul Gandhi won Amethi quite easily, but by a lower margin than 2009. Viju Cherian, in a column for Moneycontrol offers a critique of this decision by Rahul Gandhi \u2013 \u201c It is unlikely that Gandhi would lose from Wayanad. However, the confusion and indecisiveness on the part of Gandhi and the party for more than two weeks to decide on the Wayanad seat reflects poorly on the Congress President\u2019s ability to take a quick decision .\u201d The two districts are different politically. In addition to expanding to the party\u2019s footprint and appealing to a wide base of the electorate, its also a way for the Congress to look at the election from a geo-political lens. It\u2019s also not unprecedented; Indira Gandhi, whose stronghold was Rae Bareli in 1967 and then again in 1971 switched to Chikmagalur in Karnataka in 1978. In 1999, Sonia Gandhi contested Amethi and Bareli. Despite the criticisms, columnist Swati Chaturvedi writes in favor of this move taking into consideration favorability, location and history \u2013 \u201c Gandhi has outshone Modi in all opinion polls in the South. Both Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi are now in the game of delayed gratification and building up the Congress for the long term. If one concedes that the Congress, however muddled, is still in the game of being a major political party with the goal of winning elections, then Gandhi's move is smart politics .\u201d Currently, the party does not hold any assembly seats in the constituency of Amethi and BJP leader Smriti Irani is active there despite her loss to Gandhi last time around. Assuming he wins both seats, he will have to give up on which will then undergo a re-election. The Hindustan Times editorial lays out the geographical strongholds in South India \u2013 \u201c Despite the BJP\u2019s efforts, Karnataka remains the only state where it is a serious player. In contrast, while the Congress is weak in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, it is a strong contender in Kerala on its own, Karnataka with the Janata Dal (Secular), and Tamil Nadu as a part of the DMK-led alliance .\u201d As Sugata Srinivasaraju points out in The Wire, the voting trends in South India for the Congress have been mixed. In Karnataka the party won 9 seats in last time and has ceded ground to the BJP, it got 2 in Andhra Pradesh and didn\u2019t get a single seat in Tamil Nadu. The BJP faces an uphill battle in general in the south, as it has for quite some time. The strategy is clear in putting on a united front against the Hindutva brand of politics the BJP bets on in the heartland. The BJP\u2019s criticism of this move by Gandhi is arguing that he\u2019s contesting from a seat that has a lower percentage of Hindus. They have fielded a candidate to run against Gandhi in Wayanad. Thushar Vellappally is the man who will try and defeat Rahul Gandhi. He is the president of the Bharat Dharma Jana Sena, an ally of the NDA. This party was formed in 2015. His father, Vellappally Natesan, is a main stay in Kerala politics. Natesan is the General Secretary of the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) in the state which plays a major role in representing the Ezhava community. He supported the Chief Minister\u2019s initiative of organizing the Wall of Women in January. The Congress will serve itself well on forming alliances like it did in Tamil Nadu. Kerala has proven to be tougher ground. Rahul Gandhi\u2019s move to contest from Wayanad is seen as a backup and as a sign of how important the southern states will be.\nMore columns by Varun Sukumar", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rahul", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pri", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rahul gandhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venugopal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ak antony", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lok sabha", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wayanad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karnataka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amethi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tamil nadu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lok sabha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kerala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uttar pradesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T14:13:32.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1611686109ad893849d721f21cbfaf8cffec14fa", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/hudannsi_kou", "site_full": "twitcasting.tv", "site": "twitcasting.tv", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["television", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "\u6d38 (@hudannsi_kou) 's Live - TwitCasting", "title_full": "\u6d38 (@hudannsi_kou) 's Live - TwitCasting", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://imagegw03.twitcasting.tv/image3/image.twitcasting.tv/image76_1/ce/7f/1ff17fce-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2374, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1611686109ad893849d721f21cbfaf8cffec14fa", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/hudannsi_kou", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "\u6d38 (@hudannsi_kou) 's Live - TwitCasting", "text": "Title of work being infringed Details\nI read and understand the following notes and send this form.

Rather it's the open-source platform on which it's built\u2014 Stellar Lumens , the ninth most popular cryptocurrency by market cap.\nJesse Lund, head of IBM's blockchain division praises the payments and settlement network saying it cements the tech giant's leadership in the blockchain technology space. He characterizes the development of World Wire, which is now being used by six international banks including Philippines-based RCBC, South Korea's Bank Busan and Brazil's Banco Bradesco as:\n\u201cWe\u2019re building on a new idea, which is to be able to store monetary value electronically and be able to move that value around the world in real time\u2026 I think the problem with cross-border payments today, the inefficiencies are based on the fact that the way that banks communicate, the network that banks communicate on is separate from the network or the rails that money actually moves on.\nMany would argue it's already possible to store monetary value electronically and move it around in real time. Banks are already virtual although the funds stored are not yet fully digital. Which means IBM may not really be doing anything groundbreaking here.\nThat is, unless you consider Big Blue's use of Stellar. Until now, larger rival XRP , formerly known as Ripple, had been the banking industry choice. That's because, according to its developers, \"it enables secure, instant and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks.\" But, says Viabhav Kadikar, CEO of CloseCross , a decentralized market prediction platform, Steller is the preferred chain for micropayments, as it's relatively inexpensive:\n\u201cIBM has made an operational decision in choosing them [Stellar] as a network to build on. A considerable difference to the current virtual offering by banks is that the proposed flow of funds through World Wire will not require after the fact, cross border reconciliations to be carried out. This process normally involves a number of banks and even federal banks, so with World Wire they are proposing an overall increase in efficiency and transparency.\u201d\nThe way IBM portrays it, they're building a new backbone for banks, using blockchain, explains Alex Frenkel, VP of product at Kin Ecosystem. He stresses that blockchain technology is slower and harder to maintain than a conventional database. Its main virtue is in the direct exchange of value between people around the world.\n\u201cI'm not sure this is the most efficient way to improve the banking backbone,\" he adds. \"The real revolution with blockchain and crypto is removing the need to use banks for sending value across the world. In this vision, banks will have a completely different role in the financial world and will not deal with controlling and validating value exchanges between people.\u201d\nBreaking Banks Out of Their Comfort Zone\nMany banks, however, are still operating within their comfort zone, Kadikar points out.\n\"But partnering with a tech giant like IBM will [make them] feel more confident trialing new technology.\nLarge banks and corporates need to be in their comfort zone when they attempt to trial or utilize new tech. They need a partner that is solid, large and reliable based on previous experiences as well as something their regulators will accept.\u201d\nTo that end, the launch of IBM's World Wire is a good thing for the overall blockchain landscape, especially for the payments industry where the back-end functions can develop at scale in a blockchain environment without any user experience friction.\nThere is also a case to be made that transaction times and fees will drop with this latest launch. Gadi Srebnik, blockchain team lead at Kin Blockchain, which is a fork of Stellar Blockchain, believes that has serious benefits for the end consumer. \"Clients will gain as work\u2014and costs\u2014are reduced on the banking side,\u201d he says.\nPerhaps more important than the workflow and settlement efficiencies, IBM is setting the technology standard that all banks will need to meet going forward, Jehan Chu, co-founder of Social Alpha Foundation and managing partner of Kenetic points out.\n\u201cAs banks compete even harder, the near instant global settlement across their network will eventually become the new norm. IBM is signalling where the future of finance lies, and it\u2019s built on blockchain. Banks are moving from the electronic age to the digital age, with blockchain as it\u2019s connective tissue.\u201d\nIBM Surprises, Chooses Stellar Platform For New Payment Transfer Service", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fza.investing.com%2Fanalysis%2Fibm-surprises-chooses-stellar-platform-for-new-payment-transfer-service-200198422&title=IBM+Surprises%2C+Chooses+Stellar+Platform+For+New+Payment+Transfer+Service&summary=", "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.socialalphafoundation.org/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;ust%3D1553735488133000&sa=D&ust=1553735488141000&usg=AFQjCNFjVrMTIPjIWJlXxY0iK7jRUds6ug", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=179222828858436&u=https%3A%2F%2Fza.investing.com%2Fanalysis%2Fibm-surprises-chooses-stellar-platform-for-new-payment-transfer-service-200198422&display=popup&ref=plugin", "https://twitter.com/close_cross", "https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/03/21/discussing-ibms-foray-into-blockchain-based-payment-systems.html?&qsearchterm=blockchain", "https://invst.ly/afrho"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jesse lund", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new payment transfer service", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ibm", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rcbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank busan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banco bradesco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international business machines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-02T14:18:29.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "496593c5d9a5f6355a4b8304b401256bacf9ca95", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/6elkze63kunxhte", "site_full": "twitcasting.tv", "site": "twitcasting.tv", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["television", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "kiyo\u30fb\u3088\u304b\u308d\u3046\u3082\u3093\u597d\u304d (@6elKZE63KuNXHTe) 's Live - TwitCasting", "title_full": "kiyo\u30fb\u3088\u304b\u308d\u3046\u3082\u3093\u597d\u304d (@6elKZE63KuNXHTe) 's Live - TwitCasting", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://imagegw03.twitcasting.tv/image3/image.twitcasting.tv/image77_1/a5/81/1ff181a5-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2374, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "496593c5d9a5f6355a4b8304b401256bacf9ca95", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/6elkze63kunxhte", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "kiyo\u30fb\u3088\u304b\u308d\u3046\u3082\u3093\u597d\u304d (@6elKZE63KuNXHTe) 's Live - TwitCasting", "text": "Title of work being infringed Details\nI read and understand the following notes and send this form.
