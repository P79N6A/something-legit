There can be no such thing as selling to a third country. We are buying them for our own needs.\" Cavusoglu added that Turkey and Russia were discussing delivery dates.\nThe US had agreed to sell 100 of its latest, fifth-generation F-35 fighters to Turkey, and has so far delivered two of the aircraft.\nBut Congress last year ordered a delay in future deliveries.\nEarlier this month, the top US military commander for Europe, Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, told the US Congress that Turkey should reconsider its plan to buy the S-400 from Russia or forfeit other future American military aircraft and systems.\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has dismissed such threats and has even said Turkey could consider purchasing the more advanced Russian S-500 system in the future.

Korean Military Expresses Regret Over Jeju Uprising For First Time Write: 2019-04-03 15:07:39 / Update: 2019-04-03 15:22:55 Print Photo : YONHAP News Anchor: April third marks the 71st anniversary of the Jeju Uprising, which resulted in a six-year government-civilian clash, estimated to have claimed the lives of as many as 30-thousand people and left thousands more missing. For the first time, South Korea's military expressed regret over the government-led crackdown. Choi You Sun has this report. Report: South Korea's Defense Ministry on Wednesday expressed deep regret and condolences to the people of Jeju Island, who suffered during a government-led crackdown between 1948 and 1954 that followed the Jeju Uprising in 1948. Although former President Roh Moo-hyun apologized for the bloody government-civilian clash in 2003, it's the first time that the country's military has expressed regret over the incident. The military had previously described the incident as an \"armed revolt\" which the government at the time quashed through the mobilization of military and police forces. The government's fact-finding report estimates up to 30-thousand residents of Jeju Island were killed and that nearly three-thousand-600 people went missing during the crackdown, which came from Korea's ideological division following its liberation from Japanese colonial rule. National Police Agency Commissioner General Min Gab-ryong also expressed his condolences to the victims and their families at a civilian-led commemorative ceremony in downtown Seoul. Min, who is the first police chief to attend a commemorative ceremony for the Jeju Uprising, said the police will look back on its history and become a force for democracy, human rights and the welfare of the people. During the government's formal ceremony on Jeju, Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon promised that the Moon Jae-in administration will continue to search for the truth behind the incident and restore the honor of Jeju residents until they are content. He said the government will excavate the remains of those who lost their lives, confirm the identities of missing people and expand support for survivors and families of the deceased. President Moon, who attended last year's ceremony and was the first South Korean president in 12 years to do so, posted a message on social media saying that completely resolving issues from the incident is the way to achieve national unity.

I've been anxiously waiting for this final installment in The Perfect Gentlemen series. It grabbed my attention from the beginning, keeping me on the edge of my seat as I waited for what I was afraid of, and what I hoped for, to happen. I turned each page holding my breath, not knowing what to expect. I have become very attached to all of the perfect gentlemen, and their ladies. Though, I must confess that I wanted to slap at least one of them upside the head a time or twenty while reading this story.Zack has always been the voice of reason among the group of friends. He's always had his eye on the prize. Knowing that eventually his sacrifices would pay off and he'd make it to the White House. When his friends went wild having fun, he had to reign himself in to protect his future. He strategically followed the plan, mapping his career, keeping himself under control at all costs. He thought that there wasn't anything that would make him risk the presidency... until her. Liz felt their connection instantly. She knew he was something special. But, he wasn't hers. She worked tirelessly as his press secretary, admiring him and loving him in secret. They'd grown close over the years. Friends that supported and confided in each other. At least that's what she thought until he pushed her away. That soft look that used to be just for her has turned hard. Those unspoken messages that used to pass between them stopped. Her world stopped turning at the loss.There are so many things that blew my mind while reading this incredible saga. Things became clearer and more confusing at the same time. Missing pieces were found and relationships were stretched to the breaking point. What I thought I knew, I didn't. The direction I expected to go ended up being detoured and I was tempted to jump off the crazy train before it crashed. But, I'm so glad I hung on for the finale, it was epic! Was that clear as mud? Sorry, but it is a ride you need to experience for yourself, one bump and curve at a time.

I think the older man and younger woman concept is more widely accepted in the world and in society, so, we see more of it on-screen. I am sure that societal choices and the way we live will reflect in cinema because cinema is not happening in isolation.\"\nWhen Tabu was asked if she feels that actresses have less shelf life as compared to actors in today's time, Ajay chose to give an answer.\nHe said: \"I think this kind of a question is outdated because the time has changed. Today, actresses have more shelf life or as much life as compared to the male actors. It's not true at all and I am sure everybody will agree with it. There is no difference in shelf life anymore. It was there earlier, but now it is not the case. I think Tabu is here, Kajol is here and there are so many of them who are still working in films. So, things are changing.\"\nAjay is returning to a romantic comedy film after a long time. He said it was a fun experience.\nDe De Pyaar De , produced by T-Series and Luv Films, will release on May 17.

If I see their sneakers, I can tell just by looking at them what they like and what kind of a person they are.\"\nLed by rappers, pro-ballers and young Hollywood celebrities whose fame gives them that coveted \"cool factor,\" limited edition sneakers have come of age and are all the rage in both China and the United States.\nThat popularity has spawned a massive athletic shoe industry that topped 60 billion U.S. dollars worldwide in 2018 and is expected to rise to 95 billion U.S. dollars by 2025, according to 29-year-old Zhang.\nLimited quantities of any popular commodity naturally spawn fierce competition amongst buyers eager to possess it. According to Forbes, that has fueled a billion dollar secondary resale market in which a rare model bought for a mere 190 U.S. dollars can rocket up in price overnight to 6,000 U.S. dollars a pair.\nA Chinese-owned U.S. consignment store chain, SoleStage is riding that wave.\nSoleStage was founded in 2013 by Lei Wang, Zhang, and the youngest, Xia, three young Chinese guys who shared a passion for athletic shoes. At the tender ages of 13 to 15, they all started out, separately, as collectors, but got fired up with entrepreneurial zeal when they realized how profitable resale opportunities were.\n\"We decided to go into business together when we realized that separately we were just driving up prices for each other, but if we worked together, we could combine our expertise and connections and get great products at better prices,\" Zhang explained.\n\"It was hard in the beginning because some buyers were afraid that because we were Chinese we might be selling fakes. So we had to work extra hard to build our reputation for honesty and access to rare, authentic products,\" revealed Zhang.\nAnd that hard work paid off.\nTo date, the trio have opened three stores in California - Los Angeles, Irvine and Santa Clara - and one in New York City, that cater to American consumers - mostly young, hip males - serviced from a massive warehouse in City of Industry, a suburban city located 20 kilometers east of Los Angeles downtown, cock full of product that ensures they can keep up with the increasing demand.\nAnd, they are opening a fifth store in Beijing in May to better serve the Chinese market.\n\"What sets this store apart is it has something for all its customers, not just one hyped clothing brand,\" Angel Cornejo, the Hispanic-American manager of the Los Angeles store, told Xinhua. \"We reach a bigger audience. And we've got great connections, so we can offer rare stuff.\"\n\"That's the whole point,\" Xia agreed. \"With our connections, we can bring authentic U.S fashion and sneakers to China and bring Chinese brands to the U.S. It's gotta go both ways.\"\nXia wear a sport vest with a striking logo of Li Ning, a Chinese sportswear brand who debuted its fall/winter 2019 collection at the New York Fashion Week (NYFW) last month. Xia said SoleStage joined the promotion works.\nBy 2018, these three young guys had built a successful resale business, and they expect substantial growth next year when they release their new shoe buying app, \"Shine,\" that will provide accurate, up-to-the-second price comparisons and sales opportunities in both the United States and China.\n\"We know both ends, both countries, that's our advantage. We are an American-based brand that understands the U.S. market, but we are also Chinese, and we know China better than any of our competitors ever could,\" asserted Xia.\nAnd their customers agree.\n\"Fashion should be about expressing yourself and being unique. And these guys have that,\" said one young American shopper at SoleStage's Los Angeles store, next to Supreme, in the trendy West Hollywood Fairfax district.\nSupreme is an American skateboarding shop and clothing brand, established in New York City in April of 1994. The brand, catering to the hip hop, rock cultures, and the youth culture in general, is very popular both in the United States and China.\nPopular R&B and hip hop artist, Joseph DeVinci from Atlanta, told Xinhua, \"I've been here, like, 50 times. I find the craziest thing and buy it. I bought [Kobe] Bricks yesterday. I bought two pair of Yeezy's last week. I'm not a collector, I just like shoes.\"\nStore manager Angel seconded that. \"We all love shoes. When you like something, you want to know all about it: the history, colors, models, materials...\"\nHe also loves his job and is glad that his Chinese bosses set up shop in LA. \"I love working for these guys, they're my bosses, but they're also my friends. We hang out and talk a lot about shoes.\"\nAnother American regular, Tatum, said, \"It's crazy that three young Chinese guys got into this in such a big way over here. That's cool.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "huang heng", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "julia pierrepont iii", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "xia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "air jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yu zhang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jiahuan xia", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "xinhua", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nike air max", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T11:54:05.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dcf3c075326439922ee4b82afee07fe6c5345a29", "url": "http://english.eastday.com/Culture/auto/u1ai8627415.html", "site_full": "english.eastday.com", "site": "eastday.com", "site_section": "http://english.eastday.com/Culture/index.html", "site_categories": ["japan", "travel"], "section_title": "Culture-Eastday", "title": "Cherry blossoms reach peak bloom in Washington D.C., U.S.", "title_full": "Cherry blossoms reach peak bloom in Washington D.C., U.S.", "published": "2019-04-02T03:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CL", "spam_score": 0.908, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 363, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dcf3c075326439922ee4b82afee07fe6c5345a29", "url": "http://english.eastday.com/Culture/auto/u1ai8627415.html", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "eastday.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cherry blossoms reach peak bloom in Washington D.C., U.S.", "text": "Cherry blossoms are seen around the Tidal Basin in Washington D.C., the United States, on March 31, 2019.

A second transplant was required due to complications in February 2015.\nAnd although many things have changed in the last four years Ryan, who is in her 50s, said she is enjoying life again.\n\"It's been over three years since I've had to spend the night in the hospital, and I've been able to play ball and hockey again and my husband is doing his best to turn me into a dart player. I am also doing my best to pay it forward.\"\nDr. Stephen Beed, medical director of the province's Legacy of Life and critical care organ donation program, said presumed consent is an idea that was floated about 15 years ago by colleagues in the transplant field.\nA similar bill was passed in 2010 by the province's former NDP government but it wasn't proclaimed.\n\"This is a window of opportunity that's rare,\" said Beed. \"We have a chance to take what I think is a very good program and make it into what I hope will be the best program in the country.\"\nBeed said the goal of presumed consent is to get donations up to levels found in European countries such as Spain and the United Kingdom.\n\"A presumed consent system in other jurisdictions has generally resulted in a ballpark 20, 30, sometimes 35 per cent increase in donation rates,\" he said. \"That's what we are hoping for.\"\nRyan, whose tattoo also has the dates of her transplants and two doves representing her two life-saving donors, called organ donation \"a great gift you can give to anybody.\"\n\"I think the more people out there who become aware and become donors, the more people will be able to receive a gift like I received,\" she said.\nAccording to the province, 21 Nova Scotians became organ donors in 2018, while 110 people donated tissues such as corneas and heart valves.\nCurrently 110 people are waiting for organ transplants.\nRelated Stories N.S. man in need of double-lung transplant gets big fundraising boost Photos Cindy Ryan displays the tattoo that marks her two liver transplants as she attends a bill briefing at the legislature in Halifax on Tuesday, April 2, 2019.

In book one, Flirting With the Frenemy, we met Ellie Ryder. In this book, we meet her older brother, Beckett (Beck) Ryder. And the adorable science geek, Sarah Dempsey.Beck is an ex boy band, current underwear model, fashion mogul. He is currently home on a break to Copper Valley for his sister\u2019s engagement party. There is nothing he enjoys more than being home to spend time with his family and friends. He meant to send the sarcastic tweet to his sister. It was a joke. But by mistake, he sent it to his sister\u2019s neighbor whom he has never even met, and now the entire world hates him. Also, his partner in a foundation he has spent months setting up is threatening to pull out of their deal. His world is suddenly tumbling down around his ears.Sarah is the daughter of famous movie star parents. But, the world of the glitz and glamour, the paparazzi and the tabloids had never been for her. Sarah loved science. She wanted to save the endangered giraffes. She wanted to make the world a better place. So she hides out in Copper Valley, until a misplaced tweet puts her right out in front of the world all over again. \u201cThis is a woman with secrets. And I want to know every last one.\u201d A contract and a fake relationship is born to attempt to fix everything. Only the feelings that start to form between Beck and Sarah aren\u2019t fake at all. Beck is probably the happiest hero I have ever read about. This man smiled his way through this entire book. He was adorable. And oh my gosh could he eat. I loved the way he was with Sarah. He was determined to help her overcome her past in order to better face the future. And he does. He builds up her self confidence until she can\u2019t help but to believe him. \u201cKissing her is like discovering a new flavor of ice cream. Sweet and perfect, but better.\u201d These two were completely and totally adorable together. But they have a contract. Their relationship is fake. Can Sarah really trust that the feelings Beck is hinting at are real? That they could continue after their official time is finished? And his life is out in front of the world. She prefers to stay behind the scenes, hidden. Could she really be a part of the world she has spent her entire adult life hiding from? \u201cThis is what I\u2019ve been searching for my entire life without even knowing I wanted it.\u201d This book was so much fun. It is a slow burn, sweet fun read. I loved how close knit this group is. And Sarah\u2019s parents were hilarious. I do admit I had trouble keeping all of Beck\u2019s friends straight when they were all hanging out together. But this group is more like family than friends. And I loved the effect everyone\u2019s closeness had on Sarah. I really did enjoy this. I can\u2019t wait to see what comes next in this series. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for him. But I can\u2019t imagine ever letting him go.\u201d For more about this book and so many more, come and visit me at Carol's Crazy Bookish World.

Rather it's the open-source platform on which it's built\u2014 Stellar Lumens , the ninth most popular cryptocurrency by market cap.\nJesse Lund, head of IBM's blockchain division praises the payments and settlement network saying it cements the tech giant's leadership in the blockchain technology space. He characterizes the development of World Wire, which is now being used by six international banks including Philippines-based RCBC, South Korea's Bank Busan and Brazil's Banco Bradesco as:\n\u201cWe\u2019re building on a new idea, which is to be able to store monetary value electronically and be able to move that value around the world in real time\u2026 I think the problem with cross-border payments today, the inefficiencies are based on the fact that the way that banks communicate, the network that banks communicate on is separate from the network or the rails that money actually moves on.\nMany would argue it's already possible to store monetary value electronically and move it around in real time. Banks are already virtual although the funds stored are not yet fully digital. Which means IBM may not really be doing anything groundbreaking here.\nThat is, unless you consider Big Blue's use of Stellar. Until now, larger rival XRP , formerly known as Ripple, had been the banking industry choice. That's because, according to its developers, \"it enables secure, instant and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks.\" But, says Viabhav Kadikar, CEO of CloseCross , a decentralized market prediction platform, Steller is the preferred chain for micropayments, as it's relatively inexpensive:\n\u201cIBM has made an operational decision in choosing them [Stellar] as a network to build on. A considerable difference to the current virtual offering by banks is that the proposed flow of funds through World Wire will not require after the fact, cross border reconciliations to be carried out. This process normally involves a number of banks and even federal banks, so with World Wire they are proposing an overall increase in efficiency and transparency.\u201d\nThe way IBM portrays it, they're building a new backbone for banks, using blockchain, explains Alex Frenkel, VP of product at Kin Ecosystem. He stresses that blockchain technology is slower and harder to maintain than a conventional database. Its main virtue is in the direct exchange of value between people around the world.\n\u201cI'm not sure this is the most efficient way to improve the banking backbone,\" he adds. \"The real revolution with blockchain and crypto is removing the need to use banks for sending value across the world. In this vision, banks will have a completely different role in the financial world and will not deal with controlling and validating value exchanges between people.\u201d\nBreaking Banks Out of Their Comfort Zone\nMany banks, however, are still operating within their comfort zone, Kadikar points out.\n\"But partnering with a tech giant like IBM will [make them] feel more confident trialing new technology.\nLarge banks and corporates need to be in their comfort zone when they attempt to trial or utilize new tech. They need a partner that is solid, large and reliable based on previous experiences as well as something their regulators will accept.\u201d\nTo that end, the launch of IBM's World Wire is a good thing for the overall blockchain landscape, especially for the payments industry where the back-end functions can develop at scale in a blockchain environment without any user experience friction.\nThere is also a case to be made that transaction times and fees will drop with this latest launch. Gadi Srebnik, blockchain team lead at Kin Blockchain, which is a fork of Stellar Blockchain, believes that has serious benefits for the end consumer. \"Clients will gain as work\u2014and costs\u2014are reduced on the banking side,\u201d he says.\nPerhaps more important than the workflow and settlement efficiencies, IBM is setting the technology standard that all banks will need to meet going forward, Jehan Chu, co-founder of Social Alpha Foundation and managing partner of Kenetic points out.\n\u201cAs banks compete even harder, the near instant global settlement across their network will eventually become the new norm. IBM is signalling where the future of finance lies, and it\u2019s built on blockchain. Banks are moving from the electronic age to the digital age, with blockchain as it\u2019s connective tissue.\u201d\nIBM Surprises, Chooses Stellar Platform For New Payment Transfer Service", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.socialalphafoundation.org/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;ust%3D1553735488133000&sa=D&ust=1553735488141000&usg=AFQjCNFjVrMTIPjIWJlXxY0iK7jRUds6ug", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=179222828858436&u=https%3A%2F%2Fca.investing.com%2Fanalysis%2Fibm-surprises-chooses-stellar-platform-for-new-payment-transfer-service-200198408&display=popup&ref=plugin", "https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/03/21/discussing-ibms-foray-into-blockchain-based-payment-systems.html?&qsearchterm=blockchain", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fca.investing.com%2Fanalysis%2Fibm-surprises-chooses-stellar-platform-for-new-payment-transfer-service-200198408&title=IBM+Surprises%2C+Chooses+Stellar+Platform+For+New+Payment+Transfer+Service&summary=", "https://twitter.com/close_cross", "https://invst.ly/afrde"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jesse lund", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new payment transfer service", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ibm", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rcbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank busan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banco bradesco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international business machines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T16:10:28.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7b7713f300a61de5e55b4ce6c4cd92d403743893", "url": "https://www.autotrader.com/car-news/acura-cl-type-s-forgotten-special-acura-281474979921480", "site_full": "www.autotrader.com", "site": "autotrader.com", "site_section": "https://www.autotrader.com/article-search-results/?keywords=", "site_categories": ["buying_selling_cars", "vehicles"], "section_title": "Search Articles &amp; Reviews - Autotrader", "title": "The Acura CL Type-S Is a Forgotten Special Acura", "title_full": "The Acura CL Type-S Is a Forgotten Special Acura - Autotrader", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.982, "main_image": "https://www.autotrader.com/resources/img/components/open-graph_autotrader_new.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1210, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7b7713f300a61de5e55b4ce6c4cd92d403743893", "url": "https://www.autotrader.com/car-news/acura-cl-type-s-forgotten-special-acura-281474979921480", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Doug DeMuro", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Acura CL Type-S Is a Forgotten Special Acura", "text": "When you think of exciting, special Acura models, you surely think of the NSX first and foremost -- and then maybe some high-performance versions of the Integra . What you almost certainly don't think of is the CL Type-S -- although this was a special car, aimed at enthusiasts, that's been largely forgotten.\nHere's the general overview of the CL Type-S. Essentially, the CL was the coupe version of Acura's TL sedan, meaning it was front-wheel drive -- a demerit, sure, but not a fatal one. The CL was sold for two generations, and it always looked a bit nicer than its sedan counterpart.\nBut the especially exciting model in the CL range was the \"Type-S\" version, which was sold from 2000 to 2003. While the regular CL used a 225-horsepower 3.2-liter V6 , the Type-S saw a boost to 260 hp -- and an increase in torque from 216 to 232. More important, however, was the transmission choice: while the CL Type-S was only offered with a 5-speed automatic -- a transmission known to be failure-prone as it gets on in years -- Acura decided to add a 6-speed manual option for 2003. The car was canceled after that, meaning the 6-speed manual was offered with the Type-S for just one year -- meaning cars that have the transmission are exceptionally rare.\nRight now on Autotrader, there are only about a dozen CL Type-S models listed for sale from all four of the car's model years -- and just two are the extremely rare 2003 models with the 6-speed manual transmission . Both are listed for well under $10,000, providing an easy point of entry to a shockingly rare enthusiast-focused car.\nMORE FROM OVERSTEER :\nHere's Why the Koenigsegg Agera RS Is Worth $10 Million\nI Bought the Most Unreliable BMW Ever Made\nAutotrader Find: 1990 Subaru Legacy With a Landau Roof", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "nsx", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "acura", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T16:13:11.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c47880af96583c9a3b67c6220c6e5dd44cb6548c", "url": "https://ca.investing.com/news/commodities-news/gold-steadies-as-us-data-offers-mild-safehaven-support-1434467", "site_full": "ca.investing.com", "site": "investing.com", "site_section": "https://ca.investing.com/news/commodities-news", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Commodity News - Investing.com Canada", "title": "Gold Steadies as U.S. Data Offers Mild Safe-Haven Support By Investing.com", "title_full": "Gold Steadies as U.S. Data Offers Mild Safe-Haven Support By Investing.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.583, "main_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE5R1AR-ORUBS_L.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 699, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c47880af96583c9a3b67c6220c6e5dd44cb6548c", "url": "https://ca.investing.com/news/commodities-news/gold-steadies-as-us-data-offers-mild-safehaven-support-1434467", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Investing.com", "published": "2019-04-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Gold Steadies as U.S. Data Offers Mild Safe-Haven Support By Investing.com", "text": "\u00a9 Reuters.

You have to have strong enforcement provisions.\"\nDemocratic lawmakers say the deal must ensure workers in Mexico have the right to organize, a step that would require new Mexican labor laws. They believe a major weakness of NAFTA was that it allowed Mexican wages to stagnate.\n\"When you don't have strong enforcement provisions, you are essentially facilitating the outsourcing of jobs and bad worker protections and undercutting of U.S. workers,\" Representative Pramila Jayapal said last month.\nPelosi underscored that concern in the Politico interview.\n\"One of the things that the Mexican government has to do before we can even consider it, is to pass legislation about workers' rights in Mexico,\" she said.\nTop U.S. House Democrat cites labor, enforcement concerns on new NAFTA", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?app_id=179222828858436&u=https%3A%2F%2Fca.investing.com%2Fnews%2Feconomy-news%2Fupdate-1top-us-house-democrat-cites-labor-enforcement-concerns-on-new-nafta-1434161&display=popup&ref=plugin", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fca.investing.com%2Fnews%2Feconomy-news%2Fupdate-1top-us-house-democrat-cites-labor-enforcement-concerns-on-new-nafta-1434161&title=Top+U.S.+House+Democrat+cites+labor%2C+enforcement+concerns+on+new+NAFTA&summary=", "https://invst.ly/afx40"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nancy pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nafta", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "politico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usmca", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-03T16:24:11.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e9ff9be6b14fdaa6a307ecaa0f0792a398ca3fdc", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/omotikopu46", "site_full": "twitcasting.tv", "site": "twitcasting.tv", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["television", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "\u3053\u3077\ud83c\udf6b (@omotikopu46) 's Live - TwitCasting", "title_full": "\u3053\u3077\ud83c\udf6b (@omotikopu46) 's Live - TwitCasting", "published": "2019-03-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://imagegw03.twitcasting.tv/image3/image.twitcasting.tv/image75_1/5d/54/1ff5545d-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2374, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e9ff9be6b14fdaa6a307ecaa0f0792a398ca3fdc", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/omotikopu46", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-03-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "\u3053\u3077\ud83c\udf6b (@omotikopu46) 's Live - TwitCasting", "text": "Title of work being infringed Details\nI read and understand the following notes and send this form.

Before going into this book, I actually didn't know too much about the legend of Arthur Pendragon. I knew he was something like the King of Britain at some point, he pulled Excalibur from the stone, he had his Knights of the Round Table, he was killed by his son Mordred, and there was some wizard named Merlin; that was pretty much the extent of my knowledge. I also understand that this particular book does not follow that original legend, as a lot of details are vastly different, which turned this book into a story all its own.Narrated from the perspective of an old monk named Derfel, once one of Arthur's closest friends and soldiers, he writes of the Arthur that he personally knew those many years ago. This story does not tell of Arthur's childhood or how he came into possession of Excalibur, but rather focuses on the warlord Arthur in his prime, in his quest to reunite the kingdoms of Britain to fight off the Saxon invasion. It's dark and gritty, full of war and violence and destruction, and definitely not for the faint of heart. But it is a magnificently epic tale.I absolutely loved this book. It gripped me from the very first sentence, and the story Derfel tells of Arthur is so full of emotion\u2014torment and anguish, but also joy, pride, devotion. How I have wept for Arthur. But this is as much Derfel's own story as it is Arthur's. Arthur actually doesn't appear until well into the book, and more often than not, we follow Derfel himself instead of the King that Never Was. But I found that I didn't mind because Derfel was a lovely character to get to know. So many times, he praises Arthur for being great and kind and noble, but little does he know that he himself possesses these characteristics too, and that just made me absolutely fall in love with him.There are some parts that suffer from pacing issues. Entire seasons go by with little more than a passing glance, and many times we are merely told of what happens instead of being shown. Understandable because the method of which this story is being told is literally from the perspective of an old man recalling tales of his youth; however, this does end up leading to long sections of exposition that may break the reader's interest.Nevertheless, an amazing first installment, and it leaves me ready for my heart to be torn out in the next two books. T/W : rape, sexual assault, violence, ableist language, etc.. pretty much anything you can think of considering how this is set in 400's AD.

Instead, in the beginning of the revolution, when people were dying of starvation from the overwhelming amount of poverty which stemmed from the greed of the upper class, Camille became one of them. I felt every character and the plot just fell incredibly flat. I know I don't really mesh well with historical fiction in the first place, but this was really just exhausting to read.

The person was not authorized to discuss the call publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\nNielsen was creating an emergency operations center and named U.S. Border Patrol official Manny Padilla as an operational crisis coordinator to manage the response from within the different immigration agencies at the Department of Homeland Security. Padilla is a 30-year Border Patrol veteran and was recently the head of the Rio Grande Valley Sector in Texas.\nHis job will be different from that of the immigration or \u201cborder czar\u201d that Trump is considering, the official said.\nClosing the border completely would disrupt manufacturing supply lines and the flow of goods ranging from avocados to cars, making for a \u201cpotentially catastrophic economic impact,\u201d in the words of Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader.\nSome inside the administration also worry it would only exacerbate illegal immigration.\nMeantime, administration officials grappled with how they might minimize the impact of a shutdown or implement less sweeping actions.\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, for example, told CNBC he\u2019s been looking at potentially keeping truck lanes open.\n\u201cWe are looking at different options, particularly if you can keep those freight lanes, the truck lanes, open,\u201d he said. As for the hundreds of thousands of tourists and workers who cross the border legally, Kudlow said, \u201cthat may be difficult.\u201d White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders speaks to reporters at the White House in Washington on April 2, 2019. Photo by Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\nEarlier, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders had told reporters that, while, \u201cEventually, it may be that it\u2019s the best decision that we close the border,\u201d the president was \u201cnot working on a specific timeline\u201d and all options remained on the table. The Council of Economic Advisers, she said, was conducting a number of studies on the impact, and \u201cworking with the president to give him those options.\u201d\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley said in an appearance on MSNBC that closing only certain entry ports, or parts of all of them, could be among the steps short of closing the entire border.\nIt was a shift from Trump\u2019s threat late last week to seal the whole border, and quickly. \u201cI am not kidding around,\u201d he said then, exasperated by the swelling numbers of migrants, thousands of whom were being released into the U.S. because border officials had no space for them. Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed in recent months and border agents were on track to make 100,000 arrests or denials of entry in March, a 12-year high. More than half of those are families with children, who require extra care.\nWith southern border facilities near a breaking point, U.S. officials are busing many migrants hundreds of miles inland and dropping them off at bus stations and churches. Trump has mocked and vowed to end that \u201ccatch and release\u201d practice but overwhelmed authorities saw no choice.\nResponding to Trump\u2019s threats, Nielsen rushed home late Monday night from Europe, where she was attending G7 security meetings and intended to fly to the border mid-week to assess the impact of changes already made, including reassigning some 2,000 border officers assigned to check vehicles to deal with migrant crowds and new efforts to return more asylum seekers to Mexico as they wait out their case.\nOfficials were hoping to have as many as 300 asylum seekers returned to Mexico per day by the end of the week near Calexico and El Paso in Texas and San Ysidro in California. Right now, only 60 a day are returned.\nNielsen has also requested volunteers from non-immigration agencies within her department and sent a letter to Congress seeking more money and detention space and broader authority to deport families faster. The request was met with disdain by Democrats.\nEven absent the extraordinary step of sealing a national border, delays at border stations have been mounting due to the personnel reassignments, Homeland Security officials said. When the Otay Mesa, California, entry port closed for the night Monday, 150 trucks were still waiting to get into the U.S.\nShutting certain border stations or parts of them would not be unprecedented. Over the Thanksgiving holiday last year, Trump claimed he\u2019d already \u201cclosed the border\u201d after officials briefly closed the northbound lanes at San Ysidro, California, for several hours in the early morning to bolster security because of concerns about a potential influx of migrant caravan members.\nMexican officials announced Monday they\u2019d pulled 338 Central American migrants \u2014181 adults and 157 children\u2014 off five passenger buses in a southern state that borders Guatemala, and said they had detained 15 possible smugglers on immigration law violations. But that was not unusual for Mexico, which has for years been cracking down on migration.\nIn 2014 then-President Enrique Pena Nieto launched a program that was described as ensuring orderly migration but in practice resulted in making it much more difficult for Central Americans to transit.\nAssociated Press writers Catherine Lucey and Darlene Superville in Washington and Maria Verza in Mexico City contributed to this report.

This Week A salute to the importance of the national count, Santa Clara County hosts a launch event on Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. By Sue Wood, Patch Staff | Apr 1, 2019 12:07 pm ET 0 The county hopes residents will contribute because an accurate count results in critical funds and representation. (Shutterstock) SAN JOSE, CA -- The one-year countdown to Census 2020 has begun.\nSanta Clara County will host the U.S. Census Bureau, governmental agencies, nonprofits, and community partners on April 2 to address critical issues before the Census launch.\n\"The county of Santa Clara relies on almost $500 million in annual census-based funds to provide critical services to its residents,\" said Nick Kuwada, Census 2020 program manager for the county. \"The consequences of an incomplete count would be enormous for the county and its residents because it would lead to less funding for roads, healthcare and other vital services the community relies on.\"\nU.S. Census representatives will join the county at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday at the Mexican Heritage Plaza located at 1700 Alum Rock Ave. in San Jose\nFor the first time in history, the Census will be conducted primarily online instead of by mail. Santa Clara County residents will have four methods for response: internet, phone, paper form or in-person.\nMore than $675 billion in federal funding is distributed annually based on census data. Of that amount, California receives over $76 billion.\nMoreover, congressional representation is based on census data.\nThe Census has prompted a variety of concerns over questions ranging from immigration status to sexual orientation. Other challenges the Santa Clara County cites involve:\nFewer than seven in 10 households said they intend to fill out the census form. Locally, the hard-to-reach populations have a census response rate of less than 70 percent; including older adults, individuals with disabilities, immigrants and refugees. The federal government has reduced funding that assists with getting an accurate census count, limiting the manpower to contact residents about the census.

It's growing on me though. More importantly, The Blue turns out to have been an excellent choice. As someone who has been lucky enough to travel quite a bit in the past, I love reading travel related stories. Add a destination I haven't been able to visit myself and that is another bonus... And if you combine it with one of my favorite genres (suspense), the book and me most likely are going to get along. This is exactly what happened with The Blue . Best friends Lana and Kitty travel to the Philippines, randomly meeting the crew of a yacht called The Blue. When they are invited on board we get a glimpse of what it would be like to be aboard and travel that way... (I was so close to doing something similar in Panama a few years back, but things weren't ment to be) . It isn't all sunshine and rainbows though, as more than one of them seems to be hiding something. The point of view switches back between past and present, where we soon find out Lana is no longer on board of The Blue and something terrible has happened to the rest of the crew... And we slowly learn how everyone ended up in that situation. The writing is engaging and really flows; it shows the author is a travel fan herself and has investigated thoroughly; her descriptions of the setting make it as if you were right there with the characters on the yacht and discovering those wonderful places. The suspense and plot twists are well handled and will definitely keep you guessing. I could have done without the romance, but overall it wasn't too much of a distraction... In overall, this was a very entertaining and suspenseful read where you will find yourself sailing through those pages. (hide spoiler) ] P.S. Find more of my reviews here .

He was referring to a purported media reticence to report on terror attacks in Europe. \"They have their reasons, and you understand that,\" he added. The implication, I think, is that the politically correct press is concealing terrorists' backgrounds.\nRELATED ARTICLES Does Middle East Peace Require a Two-State Solution or a Palestinian Defeat?

All of the attackers on the list were Muslim\u2014and all of the attacks had been reported by multiple news outlets.\nSome researchers at Georgia State University have an alternate idea: Perhaps the media are over reporting some of the attacks. Political scientist Erin Kearns and her colleagues raise that possibility in a preliminary working paper called \" Why Do Some Terrorist Attacks Receive More Media Attention Than Others? \"\nFirst they ask how many terror attacks have taken place between 2011 and 2015. (The 2016 data will become available later this summer.) The Global Terrorism Database at the University of Maryland, which catalogs information on over 150,000 incidents since 1970, defines terrorism as an \"intentional act of violence or threat of violence by a non-state actor\" that meets at least two of three criteria. First, that it be \"aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social goal.\" Second, that there is \"evidence of an intention to coerce, intimidate, or convey some other message to a larger audience (or audiences) other than the immediate victims.\" And finally, that it be \"outside the precepts of International Humanitarian Law.\"\nThe Georgia State researchers report that the database catalogs 110 terrorist attacks in the U.S. over the most recent five-year span period in the database. (Globally, there were more than 57,000 terrorist attacks during that period.) In some cases, the media tended to report several attacks perpetrated by the same people as a single combined story; following their lead, the researchers reduce the number to 89 attacks.\nThey then set out to answer four different questions: Would an attack receive more coverage if the perpetrators were Muslim, if they were arrested, if they aimed at government employees or facilities, or if it resulted in a high number of deaths?\nFrom a series of searches at LexisNexis and CNN.com, Kearns and her colleagues gathered a dataset of 2,413 relevant news articles. If each attack had received equal media attention, they would have garnered an average of 27 news articles apiece. Interestingly, 24 of the attacks listed in the GTD did not receive any reports in the news sources they probed. For example, a cursory Nexis search failed to turn up any news stories about a 2011 arson attack on townhouses under construction in Grand Rapids, Michigan. An internet search by me did find several local news reports that cited a threatening letter warning residents to leave the neighborhood: \"This attack was not isolated, nor will it be the last. We are not peaceful. We are not willing to negotiate.\" The GTD reports so far that no one has been apprehended for the attack.\nFor those five years, the researchers found, Muslims carried out only 11 out of the 89 attacks, yet those attacks received 44 percent of the media coverage. (Meanwhile, 18 attacks actually targeted Muslims in America. The Boston marathon bombing generated 474 news reports, amounting to 20 percent of the media terrorism coverage during the period analyzed. Overall, the authors report , \"The average attack with a Muslim perpetrator is covered in 90.8 articles. Attacks with a Muslim, foreign-born perpetrator are covered in 192.8 articles on average. Compare this with other attacks, which received an average of 18.1 articles.\"\nSome non-Muslims did get intense coverage. Wade Michael Page , who killed six people in an attack on a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, generated 92 articles, or 3.8 percent of the dataset. Dylann Roof 's murder of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, inspired 179 articles, or 7.4 percent. Robert Dear 's slaying of three people at a Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs led to 204 articles, or 8.5 percent. Still, \"Controlling for target type, fatalities, and being arrested, attacks by Muslim perpetrators received, on average, 449% more coverage than other attacks.\"\nNo doubt this greater media focus on Muslim perpetrators has badly skewed the public's\u2014and Trump's\u2014impressions about the sources of terrorist attacks in the U.S. On the other hand, the Georgia State researchers do not acknowledge an important difference between the purveyors of jihadist ideology and domestic racists like Page and Roof. ISIS and Al Qaeda are adroit publicists who have leveraged their relatively few attacks into successfully instilling a sense of terror into many Americans.\nThe Georgia State researchers conclude: \"By covering terrorist attacks by Muslims dramatically more than other incidents, media frame this type of event as more prevalent. Based on these findings, it is no wonder that Americans are so fearful of radical Islamic terrorism. Reality shows, however, that these fears are misplaced.\"\nSuch fears are indeed misplaced. Your risk of being killed in a jihadist terror attack in the last 15 years amounted to roughly 1 in 2,640,000. Even if you stretch the period back to include 9/11, the risk would still just have been 1 in 110,000. Your lifetime risk of dying in a lightning strike is 1 in 161,000, and your chance of being killed in a motor vehicle crash is 1 in 114. Given that our government has already squandered more than $500 billion on homeland security , while encroaching on our liberties , it is vital that Americans keep the threat of terrorism in perspective . This new study is one small step in that direction.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/318100-trump-dishonest-press-wont-report-terrorist-attacks", "https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/using-gtd/", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/03/13/yes-the-media-do-underreport-some-terrorist-attacks-just-not-the-ones-most-people-think-of/?utm_term=.c68a9e449987", "http://www.nsc.org/learn/safety-knowledge/Pages/injury-facts-chart.aspx", "http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2011/02/east_hills_neighbors_to_meet_t.html", "https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/IncidentSummary.aspx?gtdid=201102220009", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/06/here-are-the-78-terrorist-attacks-the-white-house-says-were-largely-under-reported/?utm_term=.e529147cb433", "https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/about/", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/us/dylann-roof-trial-charleston.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/07/us/army-veteran-identified-as-suspect-in-wisconsin-shooting.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/us/judge-declares-planned-parenthood-suspect-unfit-for-trial.html", "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2928138", "http://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/economic/budget/dhs"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robby soave", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelsea clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronald bailey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "todd krainin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "terrorism donald trump united states risk islam", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2019-04-04T03:26:26.050+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7ef595f2d4d561144b7a94aa949e9eab432f5cf3", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/mmm1202_ao", "site_full": "twitcasting.tv", "site": "twitcasting.tv", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["television", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "mmm(\u5b9f\u6cc1\u8005)\u3002\ud83c\udf5e\ud83d\ude07\ud83d\udc99 (@mmm1202_ao) 's Live - TwitCasting", "title_full": "mmm(\u5b9f\u6cc1\u8005)\u3002\ud83c\udf5e\ud83d\ude07\ud83d\udc99 (@mmm1202_ao) 's Live - TwitCasting", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://imagegw03.twitcasting.tv/image3/image.twitcasting.tv/image75_1/24/d6/1ff6d624-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2374, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7ef595f2d4d561144b7a94aa949e9eab432f5cf3", "url": "http://twitcasting.tv/mmm1202_ao", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2019-04-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "mmm(\u5b9f\u6cc1\u8005)\u3002\ud83c\udf5e\ud83d\ude07\ud83d\udc99 (@mmm1202_ao) 's Live - TwitCasting", "text": "Title of work being infringed Details\nI read and understand the following notes and send this form.
