This serves both to quantify the margin by which Uber currently leads, as well as identify the growing network of alliances by a potential usurper.</p> \n <p>Ridesharing is one of the fastest-growing segments in the transportation market. According to <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/368/100/ride-sharing/worldwide\">data compiled by Statista</a>, the number of users of ridesharing services will cross the half-billion mark in 2020.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Statista further estimates that by 2020, global revenue of the ridesharing industry will be approximately $61.4 billion (USD) from 12 percent of the adult population in the various regions Statista\u2019s analysis covers. This points to a strong but linear growth trajectory for the industry at a global scale. However, continued growth won\u2019t come cheap.</p> \n <p>Sustaining growth in the ridesharing industry \u2014 especially given fierce competition in most markets from other ridesharing services, taxi companies and public transit \u2014 is a very capital-intensive endeavor.</p> \n <p>Using data for more than 260 funding rounds of all types invested into some 70 domestic and international ridesharing companies in Crunchbase\u2019s ridesharing category, we can see in the chart below just how much has been invested over the past couple of years.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Be advised that for years prior to 2013, there were still deals with known dollar amounts, but those were too small to properly show given the scale of dollar volume from subsequent years.</p> \n <p>The scaling problem presented by global ridesharing investment data points to the massive, nearly unparalleled increase in funding into that industry, one that less than a decade ago was little more than a twinkle in entrepreneurs\u2019 eyes.</p> \n <p>In the last 18 months or so, there have been a number of deals that, to an outsider, might make the ridesharing industry look like a jumbled mess of entangled alliances.</p> \n <p>For example, Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, has an autonomous car subsidiary called Waymo, and Waze, a mapping application owned by Google, began rolling out a carpooling service this year. This is all despite the fact that Google, by way of its venture arm, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/google-ventures\">GV</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/22/google-ventures-puts-258m-into-uber-its-largest-deal-ever/\">invested some $258 million</a> into <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/funding-round/42c8af05c0bf5f0a05351ca9580250e9\">Uber\u2019s Series C</a> round in August 2013.</p> \n <p>And let\u2019s not forget that Apple, which is <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/13/technology/business/apple-cars-self-driving/index.html\">developing self-driving car technology of its own</a>, led <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/funding-round/3a3f949f78a8735baef7550b42184c9f\">a $4.5 billion investment</a> into Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing in June 2016. Alibaba, Tencent and SoftBank also participated in that round, which is no coincidence, considering that each have their own ambitions in the automotive industry. Two months later, in August 2016, Didi completed a <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/8824e7820a56956bfed95a754cb37ff8\">$7 billion buyout</a> of Uber China, which capitulated after a years-long battle against Didi for a share of the Chinese market.</p> \n <p>Finally, traditional automakers have also gotten into the ridesharing mix: there was <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/9d297dbc9b213e3f6ae5fed2255c39e5\">Ford\u2019s acquisition of Chariot</a>, a private urban mass-transit company, in September 2016, and General Motors led <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/funding-round/a535b19aa1628b83004ee7cbf05c4221\">a $1 billion Series F round in Lyft</a> in late December 2015, a deal which also saw participation from Alibaba and Didi Chuxing.</p> \n <p>It\u2019s enough to make one\u2019s head spin. And given the litany of interconnected deals and dealmakers referenced above, the belief that the network of ridesharing investors is a hopelessly tangled mishmash of incumbents and competing interests may seem like a sound one.</p> \n <p>But is it though? Not really.</p> \n <p>Using investment round data from Crunchbase, we were able to map the network of investors in different ridesharing companies using <a href=\"https://gephi.org/\">Gephi</a>, an open-source network analysis and visualization package.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>The network visualization above contains three sets of nodes (i.e. the circles):</p> \n <p>The size of company nodes is determined by their \u201cindegree,\u201d a statistic derived from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph\">directed graphs</a> that counts the number of inbound connections to that node. The more inbound connections (in this case, the more investors), the bigger the indegree score and, thus, the node in this visualization. Companies like Uber and Lyft have comparatively large numbers of investors, which is why their nodes are bigger on the graph.</p> \n <p>The connections above are weighted by the number of rounds an investor has participated in with the company. Particularly loyal investors (those that have followed-on in multiple rounds after their initial investment) are closer to their portfolio companies\u2019 nodes than those with comparatively few interactions.</p> \n <p>Although aesthetically pleasing, the graph above doesn\u2019t tell us a whole lot about the network of investment though. In order to do that, we\u2019ve highlighted and labeled some of the ridesharing companies with their brand colors, and diffused the highlighting to their nearest neighbors on the graph (which, typically, is just their investors). Where those colors begin to blend, we can see where investors overlap with one another.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>We can now see that investors in the global ridesharing industry are surprisingly cleanly divided. Most investors only have one ridesharing company in their portfolio, with only a few exceptions. Some highlights of those exceptions:</p> \n <p>There are plenty of companies in the middle of the circle that have small investor networks, but for the most part, Uber is on one side, and the likes of Didi, Lyft and others are on the other.</p> \n <p>Why is that?</p> \n <p>As we mentioned earlier, Didi Chuxing holds a somewhat unique position in this network, as it is both a company that has received outside investment and a strategic investor.</p> \n <p>This version of the network visualization highlights Didi Chuxing and some of the ridesharing companies in which it has invested.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Apart from being a dominant player in its home country of China, Didi has been making strategic investments in ridesharing companies around the world. Here are a selection of its deals:</p> \n <p>This investment strategy is, presumably, an effort to counter Uber\u2019s global expansion. If this is the case, this strategy is an interesting exercise in investment ju jitsu. Rather than plowing considerable resources into developing ground operations in far-flung outposts around the world, like Uber has, Didi has instead bought up stakes in regionally dominant companies.</p> \n <p>This \u201cbuy\u201d rather than \u201cbuild\u201d approach to expanding its international reach places Didi in a somewhat unique position in the global ridesharing market. And this approach seems to be working, at least for now.</p> \n <p>We recently learned that Didi is in the running to buy up even more of its chief rival. New York Times reporter Mike Isaac <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/897326706691719168\">tweeted</a> that Didi has joined SoftBank and other investors in a syndicate to purchase more shares of Uber, and this development has also been covered by The Information.</p> \n <p>The question is, which strategy will prevail? Although Uber has a decent war chest to continue to build its operations in its many international markets, Didi is better capitalized, and has an alliance with SoftBank, the deepest pocket in VC, PE and buyouts today. As of right now, Didi is the most-funded company in the ridesharing space, with almost $4 billion more cash raised than Uber, to say nothing of debt and credit facilities. For Didi, buying its way to global domination of the ridesharing industry is a viable strategy.</p> \n <p>With its reach expanding in scope and depth outside of China, Didi may be the ridesharing company to watch \u2014 Uber be damned.</p>  \n</div>",

This serves both to quantify the margin by which Uber currently leads, as well as identify the growing network of alliances by a potential usurper. Ridesharing is one of the fastest-growing segments in the transportation market. According to data compiled by Statista, the number of users of ridesharing services will cross the half-billion mark in 2020.

Sustaining growth in the ridesharing industry \u2014 especially given fierce competition in most markets from other ridesharing services, taxi companies and public transit \u2014 is a very capital-intensive endeavor. Using data for more than 260 funding rounds of all types invested into some 70 domestic and international ridesharing companies in Crunchbase\u2019s ridesharing category, we can see in the chart below just how much has been invested over the past couple of years. Be advised that for years prior to 2013, there were still deals with known dollar amounts, but those were too small to properly show given the scale of dollar volume from subsequent years. The scaling problem presented by global ridesharing investment data points to the massive, nearly unparalleled increase in funding into that industry, one that less than a decade ago was little more than a twinkle in entrepreneurs\u2019 eyes. In the last 18 months or so, there have been a number of deals that, to an outsider, might make the ridesharing industry look like a jumbled mess of entangled alliances. For example, Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, has an autonomous car subsidiary called Waymo, and Waze, a mapping application owned by Google, began rolling out a carpooling service this year. This is all despite the fact that Google, by way of its venture arm, GV, invested some $258 million into Uber\u2019s Series C round in August 2013. And let\u2019s not forget that Apple, which is developing self-driving car technology of its own, led a $4.5 billion investment into Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing in June 2016. Alibaba, Tencent and SoftBank also participated in that round, which is no coincidence, considering that each have their own ambitions in the automotive industry. Two months later, in August 2016, Didi completed a $7 billion buyout of Uber China, which capitulated after a years-long battle against Didi for a share of the Chinese market. Finally, traditional automakers have also gotten into the ridesharing mix: there was Ford\u2019s acquisition of Chariot, a private urban mass-transit company, in September 2016, and General Motors led a $1 billion Series F round in Lyft in late December 2015, a deal which also saw participation from Alibaba and Didi Chuxing. It\u2019s enough to make one\u2019s head spin. And given the litany of interconnected deals and dealmakers referenced above, the belief that the network of ridesharing investors is a hopelessly tangled mishmash of incumbents and competing interests may seem like a sound one. But is it though? Not really. Using investment round data from Crunchbase, we were able to map the network of investors in different ridesharing companies using Gephi, an open-source network analysis and visualization package. The network visualization above contains three sets of nodes (i.e. the circles): The size of company nodes is determined by their \u201cindegree,\u201d a statistic derived from directed graphs that counts the number of inbound connections to that node. The more inbound connections (in this case, the more investors), the bigger the indegree score and, thus, the node in this visualization. Companies like Uber and Lyft have comparatively large numbers of investors, which is why their nodes are bigger on the graph. The connections above are weighted by the number of rounds an investor has participated in with the company. Particularly loyal investors (those that have followed-on in multiple rounds after their initial investment) are closer to their portfolio companies\u2019 nodes than those with comparatively few interactions. Although aesthetically pleasing, the graph above doesn\u2019t tell us a whole lot about the network of investment though. In order to do that, we\u2019ve highlighted and labeled some of the ridesharing companies with their brand colors, and diffused the highlighting to their nearest neighbors on the graph (which, typically, is just their investors). Where those colors begin to blend, we can see where investors overlap with one another. We can now see that investors in the global ridesharing industry are surprisingly cleanly divided. Most investors only have one ridesharing company in their portfolio, with only a few exceptions. Some highlights of those exceptions: There are plenty of companies in the middle of the circle that have small investor networks, but for the most part, Uber is on one side, and the likes of Didi, Lyft and others are on the other. Why is that? As we mentioned earlier, Didi Chuxing holds a somewhat unique position in this network, as it is both a company that has received outside investment and a strategic investor. This version of the network visualization highlights Didi Chuxing and some of the ridesharing companies in which it has invested. Apart from being a dominant player in its home country of China, Didi has been making strategic investments in ridesharing companies around the world. Here are a selection of its deals: This investment strategy is, presumably, an effort to counter Uber\u2019s global expansion. If this is the case, this strategy is an interesting exercise in investment ju jitsu. Rather than plowing considerable resources into developing ground operations in far-flung outposts around the world, like Uber has, Didi has instead bought up stakes in regionally dominant companies. This \u201cbuy\u201d rather than \u201cbuild\u201d approach to expanding its international reach places Didi in a somewhat unique position in the global ridesharing market. And this approach seems to be working, at least for now. We recently learned that Didi is in the running to buy up even more of its chief rival. New York Times reporter Mike Isaac tweeted that Didi has joined SoftBank and other investors in a syndicate to purchase more shares of Uber, and this development has also been covered by The Information. The question is, which strategy will prevail? Although Uber has a decent war chest to continue to build its operations in its many international markets, Didi is better capitalized, and has an alliance with SoftBank, the deepest pocket in VC, PE and buyouts today. As of right now, Didi is the most-funded company in the ridesharing space, with almost $4 billion more cash raised than Uber, to say nothing of debt and credit facilities. For Didi, buying its way to global domination of the ridesharing industry is a viable strategy. With its reach expanding in scope and depth outside of China, Didi may be the ridesharing company to watch \u2014 Uber be damned.",

        "structuredText": "<div>   \n <p>Tony Fadell is at the Grove, a spectacularly beautiful country estate outside of London. The event is Founders Forum: the ultra \u00adexclusive invite-only tech conference. Prince William is in the house. The guest list is lousy with knights and lesser officers of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. Marissa Mayer, the now ex-CEO of Yahoo, and Biz Stone, recently returned to Twitter, are mingling with the other hundred or so invitees. But this is really Fadell\u2019s moment. </p> \n <p> It\u2019s almost exactly 10 years since the iPhone was released, and the media buzz is inescapable. The press is having trouble coming up with superlatives to describe the impact of a device that has sold more than a billion units. A new book, <a href=\"http://a.co/6TplyWy\">The One Device</a> , is lighting up the intertubes with fresh gossip about \u201cthe secret history of the iPhone.\u201d And Fadell\u2014both the source and the subject of that gossip\u2014is getting his due as one of the guys most responsible for turning Steve Jobs\u2019 one-device-to-rule-them-all vision into reality. </p> \n <p> The title of the afternoon session is \u201cWhat to Build Next?\u201d and Fadell is onstage with two other bona fide tech zillionaires\u2014Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m, the Skype guy; and Kevin Ryan, one of New York City\u2019s most successful internet entrepreneurs\u2014as well as a couple of other founder-\u00adinvestor types. Of the five people onstage, Fadell is the only one who helped build an object that every person in the audience has most likely used at one time or another. First Fadell helped build the iPod for <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/apple\">Apple</a> , then the iPhone, and then he ventured out on his own to build the Nest thermostat. </p> \n <p>Fadell is the star of the show, and he knows it. His self-confidence is well earned but can come across as overweening\u2014especially to those who suddenly find themselves in his shadow. \u201cAny VC who tells you that you have to move to Silicon Valley,\u201d Fadell says at one point, gesticulating wildly, \u201cis being very lazy.\u201d Two of the other people onstage are, in fact, from Silicon Valley venture capital firms, and their collars seem to squeeze a bit tighter. Fadell, in comparison, is supremely comfortable: relaxed and expansive in a pair of bright red sneakers\u2014no socks\u2014and a polo shirt. The moderator, wrapping things up, calls for a lightning round: a rapid-fire series of questions\u2014with only one-word answers allowed.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <div> \n  <h4>Related Stories</h4> \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"/story/disruption-is-how-silicon-valley-eats-its-young/\"> \n     <div> \n      <div> \n       <div> \n        <div></div> \n       </div> \n      </div> \n     </div> \n     <div> \n      <p>\"Disruption\" Is How Silicon Valley Eats Its Young</p> \n     </div></a></li> \n   <li><a href=\"/2017/05/can-denver-become-like-silicon-valley/\"> \n     <div> \n      <div> \n       <div> \n        <div></div> \n       </div> \n      </div> \n     </div> \n     <div> \n      <p>Can the American Heartland Remake Itself in the Image of Silicon Valley?

Then he adds, \u201cWe\u2019regoingtohavetogonuclear \u2026\u201d before being hushed by the moderator for busting the one-word rule.</p> \n <p>What\u2019s the next big thing in tech?</p> \n <p>\u201cComputational synthetic biology,\u201d Fadell says, bending the rules a second time.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>What is the one word that people who know you would use to describe you?</p> \n <p>With that, the panel is over, and Fadell is mobbed as he tries to leave the Grove\u2019s 18th-century manor. People want autographs, selfies, a word or two\u2014but the most persistent want money and advice. Like many of his contemporaries, Fadell makes personal investments as an angel, through a firm called Future Shape, with one important difference: He says he has a venture-size pool of money\u2014a portfolio of Future Shape investments worth more than half a billion dollars. Looking to make his escape, Fadell slips into the men\u2019s room. One persistent supplicant follows and, while Fadell is standing at the urinal, penis in hand, proceeds to make his pitch. It\u2019s a startup with a new design for a robotic arm. Fadell listens for less than a minute and, shaking off, says: \u201cA new robot arm? China is going to copy that in a second! What then? What\u2019s your value proposition?\u201d</p> \n <p>Faster, better, cheaper \u2026 blah blah blah.</p> \n <p>\u201cNot good enough!\u201d Fadell thinks, before offering some bland words of encouragement and dashing off to slip into the back seat of a black Mercedes-Benz S-class emblazoned with the AMG performance badge. As we start to speed toward central London to catch the afternoon Eurostar to Paris, he entertains the chauffeur (and me) with the penis-pitch story. \u201cI did like his persistence, though,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cI respect that.\u201d</p> \n <p>Turning philosophical, Fadell puts on his shades against the bright sun streaming through the backseat sunroof. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like being a film producer,\u201d he says, reflecting on his new role, post-Nest, as an investor. People pitch him, and if he likes their idea, it\u2019s go time.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>As if on cue, Fadell is forced to cut his reverie short to take a call from a young journalist doing a story on \u201cthe new culture of celebrity in tech.\u201d</p> \n <p>Did you ever think that tech would make you into a celebrity?</p> \n <p> \u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Fadell says. \u201cThe tech business in the \u201980s was Revenge of the Nerds . It was geeks. We were looked down upon, trodden upon \u2026\u201d Fadell is working himself into his trademark lather. \u201c\u2009\u2018Who are these crazy guys with pocket protectors and broken glasses?\u2019\u2009\u201d he asks rhetorically. \u201cSo you never thought that you were going to become a rock star,\u201d Fadell says, winding down, before quickly amending the thought. \u201cNot that I am,\u201d he says, \u201cbut that\u2019s what some people think.\u201d </p> \n <p>I don\u2019t think Fadell is a rock star, but I\u2019m quickly realizing that he is not your run-of-the-mill Silicon Valley billionaire making an early retirement out of an investing hobby either. For starters, he doesn\u2019t even live in the Valley anymore. He has moved to Paris. Permanently. And the more I learn about him, the more I begin to suspect that Silicon Valley\u2019s favorite son secretly hates the Valley. To hear Fadell tell it, he certainly has reason to.</p>   \n <p>Rewind to the early \u201990s. Fadell, a computer engineering major at the University of Michigan, has already tasted entrepreneurial success with a little education-software company called Constructive Instruments that he founded in his dorm room, but he wants more. \u201cI was getting very frustrated being a big fish in a little pond in Ann Arbor,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cand my eyes were looking at the West going, Silicon Valley , Silicon Valley , Silicon Valley .\u201d For a technologist like Fadell, there was no other place. Then, when news broke that a handful of Apple alumni\u2014including the hero-programmer behind the Mac, Andy Hertzfeld\u2014had escaped the mothership and banded together to form a new company, General Magic, Fadell saw his future. </p> \n <p> Not long after graduating in 1991, he showed up at General Magic\u2019s offices in Mountain View, California, early one midweek morning, unannounced. And because he was there before the receptionist, he just started wandering the halls, uncomfortable in his jacket and tie, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in hand. He eventually found some people to pester\u2014people who had clearly been there all night, hacking away. Leave us alone , kid . \u201cI was humbled in the first 10 minutes of being there,\u201d he says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, this is not like Michigan, I have got to be here, these are the smartest people ever, I have got to be working here. I have to be working here.\u2019\u201d </p> \n <p>The young Fadell had persistence, and it paid off: By the end of 1991 he had a job offer from General Magic. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have said, back then, \u2018This guy\u2019s going to change the world,\u2019 particularly,\u201d Hertzfeld says. \u201cHe was incredibly talented, very opinionated, obviously very bright, and physically very strong.\u201d</p> \n <p>At General Magic, Fadell joined a small team that was trying to build something the company had labeled a personal communicator. \u201cIt had email. It had downloadable apps. It had shopping. It had animations and graphics and games. It had telecommunications\u2014a phone, a built-in modem,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cIt was the iPhone 14 years too soon.\u201d It never got off the ground, and Magic ran out of tricks and cash by the early 2000s, but the experience was formative. \u201cHardware, software, services. That was the first link that I ever saw like that,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cThat has influenced everything I\u2019ve done since.\u201d</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>A few years after leaving General Magic, Fadell had his own startup, Fuse Systems. It was a hardware company that was attempting to capitalize on the Napster-\u00adfueled rise of the MP3 music format. Yves B\u00e9har, the noted product designer, remembers working with the nascent company: The idea was to make a full line of MP3-optimized music players\u2014everything from a component stereo system to a small portable Walkman-type device. \u201cTony was talking about a world where media, especially music, was going to be all digital,\u201d B\u00e9har says. \u201cAnd he got so excited and animated and passionate that he broke a chair\u2014he was just very physical, getting up and sitting down again\u2014and that became a joke: Tony\u2019s a kind of excitable guy who breaks the furniture.\u201d</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>To get the idea off the ground, Fadell rented an office in San Francisco\u2019s Telegraph Hill neighborhood and hired about a dozen people. Then Apple called. This was just after Jobs had returned to the company he founded and was struggling to save it from oblivion. Jobs was looking for a way out of a no-win battle with Microsoft and, like Fadell, had hit upon the idea of a portable MP3 player. Toshiba had just announced the launch of a small-\u00adformat disk drive that would give the Apple MP3 player a crucial advantage over the competition. But Apple needed someone who knew the tech forward and backward to build out a prototype. Executives asked him to come in to discuss something\u2014they were cagey about exactly what.</p> \n <p>Fadell assumed Apple needed some help designing a next-gen Newton and took the meeting. It was only after he signed the nondisclosure agreements that he discovered that the company wanted him to design a portable MP3 player\u2014the future iPod. In effect, Apple was asking Fadell for help in competing with himself. Yet if Fuse were to have any chance of survival, Fadell had to take the consulting gig at Apple, because Fuse needed another infusion of cash. The traditional sources of funding had shut down because the dotcom crash was already under way.</p> \n <p>Fadell put Fuse on autopilot and designed the iPod prototype for Apple in six short weeks. After he demonstrated how the iPod could be built\u2014which components, which interfaces, and at what price\u2014Jobs put Fadell into a double bind. He asked him to abandon the Fuse MP3 player designs and develop his idea inside Apple, which would mean killing his own company. It was agonizing for the young entrepreneur. \u201cI was just like, whoa!\u201d says Fadell, who even now gets worked up at the thought. \u201cI am like, \u2018Wait a second, I have a company, and there are people over there working on this other thing. How am I going to do this?\u2019 So I just got in my car, and I started driving through the hills of Saratoga and Los Gatos. I go up to Skyline, I wind up those roads, and I\u2019m just sitting there going, \u2018What am I going to do? What am I doing?\u2019\u201d</p> \n <p>In the end, Fadell didn\u2019t have much of a choice. The odds of Fuse succeeding on its own were not good. So he put his own dreams in a box and went to work for Apple as the head of the iPod project. The first iPod was not perfect, but it was still way better than the competition\u2014and as it was refined, it grew into a monster hit. Steve Wozniak, who watched it all happen from the inside, credits the iPod with turning the entire company around. \u201cIt made our revenues double, our profits double, and our stock double,\u201d he says. The iPod was a hit, and Fadell was a hero inside Apple.</p> \n <p>When Jobs announced that he had cancer in 2004, Fadell was on every list of potential successors. He even reminded people of the mercurial Apple founder, both in his ability to get things done and in the way he operated. \u201cTony is a little bit like Steve Jobs in the way he shaded the truth,\u201d says Hertzfeld, who was close to both men. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly lying, but it\u2019s expressing things in an advantageous way.\u201d</p> \n <p>The iPhone, which came out in 2007, was Fadell\u2019s last chapter at Apple. As the guy who built the iPod, he had earned the right to shape the company\u2019s next flagship product. The phone project started in earnest at the end of 2004. By that time, Fadell and his team had prototyped iPods that could also make phone calls. Fadell\u2019s design used the iPod\u2019s circular controller like a rotary dial. But there was another team inside Apple with a bigger idea\u2014the all-touch screen. And the competition between the two teams at times escalated into full-on corporate warfare.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <div>  \n  <p>\u201cTony started to adopt Steve Jobs\u2019 mannerisms and persona because it was a pressure cooker\u2014but also you emulate what works, right? And so everyone started screaming at each other.\u201d</p>  \n </div> \n <p>Fadell lost the battle over the iPhone\u2019s final design\u2014but, because of his previous success, he was still expected to build the hardware, a power-sharing situation that created all kinds of drama with Scott Forstall, Apple\u2019s legendary software guru. \u201cThis is when Steve\u2019s leadership and management style started to permeate the company,\u201d remembers Andy Grignon, the manager responsible for the \u201cphone\u201d part of the iPhone. \u201cTony started to adopt Steve\u2019s mannerisms and persona because it was a pressure cooker\u2014but also you emulate what works, right? And so everyone started screaming at each other. It became just like the thing to do: Fly off the fucking handle.\u201d And by the time the iPhone was ready to launch, it seemed Fadell was no longer the golden boy.</p> \n <p> Jobs appeared to confirm this fact in an exceptionally cruel way: The message was signaled from the stage at the very event where the iPhone was unveiled, on January 9, 2007. When Jobs was demonstrating the iPhone\u2019s contact list, he showed that he could delete a contact with one tap\u2014and the contact he deleted was \u201c <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0wQ7oL9pIIU\">Tony Fadell</a> .\u201d The public may not have thought twice about the gesture, but the Apple engineers in the audience understood exactly what was going on. \u201cPeople laughed about it, but everybody knew,\u201d Grignon says. \u201cSteve was in many ways diabolical, and Tony and Steve\u2019s relationship had grown increasingly rocky.\u201d Fadell insists that his relationship with Jobs remained solid, but he seems to have been pretty decisively outmaneuvered. \u201cThat demo script,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cwas created by Scott Forstall.\u201d (A source closely involved with the presentation says Jobs was ad-libbing.) Fadell and his wife, Danielle Lambert, also an Apple employee, eventually decided they\u2019d had enough and were gone by November 2008. Fadell says they left to spend more time with their kids. \u201cSteve was wondering why we didn\u2019t do it sooner,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cAnd then for a year, year and a half, we kind of went around the world.\u201d The city they liked best was Paris, so there they settled. They bought a big, beautiful apartment in the seventh arrondissement, started filling it with contemporary art, and enrolled their eldest son in the local school. </p>        \n <p>Fadell is in full manic panic, and those are the first words out of his mouth as I step into his garden courtyard in the seventh. It\u2019s early in the morning, the day after Founders Forum in London, and I\u2019m being escorted onto the premises by Fadell\u2019s PR person. Today she has scheduled Fadell for a long sit-down interview with me. But all of that has been forgotten, as Fadell has just been hit with some disturbing news. \u201cFucking Apple,\u201d he says. Fadell clams up after this outburst, but I later hear there is a dispute brewing between one of the Future Shape companies and Apple.</p> \n <p>Fadell has invested in hundreds of startup companies, and I have no idea which of them is butting heads with Apple. However, I do glean enough to understand that there is nothing unusual about the morning\u2019s drama. Fadell is a drama king: The more drama, the better. In fact, Fadell\u2019s PR person is a specialist in what has come to be called crisis PR, and she tells me that with Fadell, \u201cevery day is a new adventure.\u201d</p> \n <p>Indeed, the next thing I hear from Fadell is that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to go now.\u201d He has decided that, instead of sitting down for the interview this morning, he has to make an appearance at VivaTech\u2014the TechCrunch of Europe. He points to a pair of bikes waiting in the courtyard, outfitted with a device that gives them an electric boost. The devices are from a startup called Superpedestrian, and Fadell is an investor. The bet on e-bikes is emblematic of the types of investments he\u2019s looking for. He tends to like hardware startups. He looks for industries that are very stable, where the basic designs, tools, or materials have barely changed for a long time. Consider Modern Meadow, a Future Shape portfolio company, which is trying to replace cow leather with a lab-grown substitute. Then there\u2019s a heating and cooling company aiming to replace every compressor in every industrial refrigerator in the world with a solid-state thermoelectric cooler\u2014a chip, in essence. In Fadell\u2019s mind, the ultimate triumph would be a breakthrough battery: \u201cIf we have energy storage technologies that are very cheap and very efficient, then we\u2019re going to see wars stop, because no one is going to be fighting over oil reserves anymore.\u201d</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>We each take a bike and head into traffic, riding south on Boulevard Saint-Germain and then merging into traffic to veer onto Boulevard Raspail. Fadell has our destination\u2014the Paris Expo center\u2014dialed into his iPhone. It\u2019s only 4 miles away, but we are going to have to sprint to get there in time. There\u2019s only one problem: \u201cMy boost doesn\u2019t work!\u201d Fadell says.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>No matter, he just stands up on his pedals and grinds like a bike messenger who has just guzzled a gallon of espresso. Keeping up is not easy, even with my Superpedestrian-assisted superlegs, because Fadell is blowing through red lights, splitting lanes, squeezing through wormholes in moving traffic. And doing it all one-handed so he can keep an eye on the map.</p> \n <p>\u201cWatch out for cops, OK?\u201d he says as we blast through another busy intersection. \u201cIf they see me riding with my phone out, it\u2019s an automatic ticket.\u201d</p> \n <p>We\u2019re cranking, running with traffic on the Rue de Rennes, and then the second technical fail strikes.</p> \n <p>\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d Fadell grunts, glaring at his screen while spinning his crankset madly. \u201cMy phone is only at 50 percent charge. It was full when we left this morning.\u201d</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>\u201cYou need to be able to jack it into that battery in the bike,\u201d I say, offering an unsolicited design critique.</p> \n <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201d he says, leaning into a chicane designed to slow traffic.</p> \n <p>A left, a right. The streets are getting wider: four lanes, then six. Traffic is moving faster and faster. Fadell is starting to sweat.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>\u201cI need to reboot. There\u2019s a bug in the phone. It\u2019s sucking power,\u201d he says. We glide to a stop at the edge of a deserted plaza near a train station so Fadell can reboot his iPhone. The reboot doesn\u2019t fix the bug. \u201cSuch is the life of a digital citizen,\u201d he sighs.</p> \n <p>I have an idea: I hand him my Android so he can continue to navigate, and we are off again. It\u2019s all downhill from here, and soon we are on a paved bike path. Fadell narrowly escapes a head-on collision with a helmeted mountain biker while trying to get his bearings from the unfamiliar phone.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>We\u2019ve got gravity at our back, trees to our left, and pedestrians to our right. We\u2019re laying down a groove in a dedicated bike lane carved out of an impossibly wide Parisian sidewalk.</p> \n <p>\u201cIt says we\u2019re here! Do you see it? It\u2019s just to our left somewhere,\u201d Fadell says, craning his neck, looking for the Expo center.</p> \n <p>Fadell\u2019s front wheel goes kerflooey against a half-inch granite curb delineating the edge of the bike lane, and he\u2019s thrown to the ground. The bicyclist behind us swerves to avoid the crash and curses at Fadell while he\u2019s down, splayed over his crumpled bike: \u201cMerde!\u201d</p> \n <p>My phone is yards away, having escaped Fadell\u2019s grip when he went flying. The screen is shattered. Fadell has dirt stains on the knees of his white jeans.</p> \n <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to put this in the story, are you?\u201d Fadell asks.</p>    \n <div></div>  \n <div> \n  <p>Fadell never misses a chance to pooh-pooh the Valley. He made a fortune in Silicon Valley and now has left it for good. He\u2019s putting down roots in Paris.</p> \n </div> \n <div> Nadav Kander \n </div>   \n <p>The one problem with moving to Paris was that Fadell had no real network there. Then he met Xavier Niel\u2014a man sometimes referred to as \u201cthe French Steve Jobs.\u201d He made his money as an internet entrepreneur and now, like Fadell, invests it. \u201cI was reading blogs and stuff, but I wanted to talk to other people in the business,\u201d Fadell tells me. </p> \n <p>\u201cAt the time, Paris wasn\u2019t a big tech city,\u201d says Niel, who recalls meeting Fadell early one afternoon in his office in 2009. It was a blind date bromance, and they talked for almost 10 hours straight. \u201cOh my God, we just bonded instantly,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cWe had similar backgrounds, just in different countries. He had an Apple II, I had an Apple II.\u201d</p> \n <p>\u201cWe spoke a lot about electronics \u2026\u201d Niel says.</p> \n <p>Fadell had an idea about a company of his own and was looking for collaborators. \u201cNest was burning inside me to be created,\u201d he says. Niel was an early investor.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>The Nest elevator pitch: home thermostat meets the iPhone. Nest was never simply about making a smarter, more beautiful thermostat, any more than the iPhone was about making a smarter, more beautiful phone. The business pitch was that, someday soon, every device in the average house\u2014every lock, appliance, power outlet, and light switch\u2014would be replaced by a fancy cloud-\u00adconnected gizmo. And what would connect this so-called internet of things? Who would provide the operating system to the houses and apartments we would all be living in? Well, Nest of course.</p> \n <p>Fadell moved back to Silicon Valley to build it with Matt Rogers, who had been Fadell\u2019s colleague at Apple. The company was incorporated in June 2010 and was in stealth mode for more than a year. Google\u2019s Sergey Brin saw a prototype early in 2011 and immediately moved to buy the company. Fadell said no. Steve Jobs heard about the thermostat and wanted to see it too, but by the time Fadell felt it was perfect enough to show to the perfectionist, Jobs was on his deathbed. He never saw it.</p> \n <p>The Nest thermostat debuted at the end of 2011 and earned Nest a raft of plaudits and design awards, and all the attention was making Fadell nervous. \u201cI have seen this before,\u201d he says, \u201cwhere you\u2019re the biggest fish in the smaller pond, and then all of a sudden the pond grows immensely because Google or Microsoft or Apple or Amazon or Samsung gets into it, and now you\u2019re a very tiny fish with these big, big, big whales.\u201d</p> \n <p>By the summer of 2013, the second product in the Nest family, a smart smoke detector, was about to come out, and Fadell was looking to raise more money through an investment round. \u201cWe had connected products, but what we wanted to do was connect the whole thing together. That was the vision of Nest. So how much money was it going to take?\u201d Fadell asks. The answer: a ton of money\u2014and time too. Meanwhile, Google was still interested in buying the company outright. Nest was starting to look like the key that could unlock a gazillion-dollar \u201cconnected home\u201d market, and acquiring Fadell seemed to be a chance to inject Google with some of the design DNA that had made Apple the most valuable company in the world.</p> \n <p>Fadell was pressed hard against the same dilemma he\u2019d faced at Fuse a decade earlier. He could bet everything on himself and risk losing\u2014or he could try to pursue his vision inside the confines of a warm corporate cocoon. This time the double bind wasn\u2019t so heartbreaking. Fadell wouldn\u2019t have to kill his company, because Nest would effectively live inside Google. Fadell could keep control while drawing on all the Google infrastructure he needed to build Nest into a connected-home platform. \u201cAll kinds of promises were made,\u201d Fadell says. Including, according to a source who saw the contract, a five-year \u201crunway\u201d\u2014a period of time in which Nest could spend and innovate freely with the goal of capturing the entire connected-\u00adhome ecosystem that everyone knew was coming.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p> In January 2014, Google acquired Nest for $3.2 billion. Five months later, Google bought Dropcam, a smart home-security-camera company. The plan was to do some modifications, rebrand the system, and add the \u201cnew\u201d Nest Cam into Fadell\u2019s product line. That\u2019s what happened, but not before the former Dropcam CEO, Greg Duffy, attempted a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat early in 2015. According to an article on the news site The Information , Duffy sent an email to Google CEO Larry Page complaining about Fadell, his boss at Nest. He also recommended that Fadell be fired and suggested that he himself should replace Fadell. When Duffy\u2019s insubordinate power play got no response from Page, he quit Nest and, for good measure, says he told Fadell, \u201cI think you\u2019re running this company like a tyrant bureaucrat!\u201d before walking out. </p> \n <p>There\u2019s definitely a tyrannical streak in Fadell\u2014in a heated moment Fadell once asked his cofounder, Rogers, to postpone his honeymoon to help the Nest team meet some deadlines. (Rogers knew the storm would pass and took his honeymoon as scheduled.) But Fadell\u2019s real problem wasn\u2019t his so-called tyranny\u2014it was the new bureaucracy he suddenly found himself in.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>The month after Duffy transferred out of Nest, becoming an \u201centrepreneur in residence\u201d deep inside the Google death star, Ruth Porat was hired as Google\u2019s new CFO. Porat had deep roots in Silicon Valley\u2014her brother, Marc, was Fadell\u2019s boss at General Magic\u2014but Porat came from Wall Street.</p> \n <p> She was hired to bring financial discipline to Google. And indeed, within five months, Google announced that it was no longer \u201cGoogle\u201d anymore. It was <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/04/googles-alphabet-transition-tougher-b-c/\">Alphabet</a> , a holding company that would contain at least a dozen divisions. There would be the core search-and-\u00adadvertising company called \u201cGoogle\u201d as well as what Alphabet called its \u201cother bets.\u201d Nest was one of the other bets, and as a division Nest would have to meet certain revenue goals, and its balance sheet would suddenly be subject to large overhead and other indirect charges from Alphabet. </p> \n <p>Fadell remembers the moment vividly. He thought he had a promise: five years in which to build Nest into the dominant connected-\u00adhome platform. But everything changed when Google morphed into Alphabet. \u201cThey decided there was a new regime in town, and they said, \u2018We\u2019re going to have all new metrics,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018This is not what we agreed to before,\u2019 because this was not just about fiscal things\u2014it was about getting married. I had never thought about being bought. It was about getting married to build a beautiful child, right?\u201d</p> \n <p>Fadell soldiered on under the new regime for four months, until at the end of 2015 he discovered that the new bottom-line-oriented Alphabet was going to sell Nest. \u201cAt that point I knew it wasn\u2019t going to work out, and that\u2019s when I came home to my wife, after a lot of struggles with the Alphabet thing. It wasn\u2019t working, it was, OK, it\u2019s over.\u201d</p> \n <p> Things went south after Fadell told Page that he wanted out in December of 2015. The tech blogs started circling, and the famously tight-lipped Google started leaking. Recode got ahold of a meme, created by someone inside the company, that showed a cartoon mob, torches raised high, behind the words \u201csell nest.\u201d The Information  did a damning expos\u00e9, featuring Duffy\u2019s version of Nest as a bloated, ineffectual organization. In a follow-up blog post, Duffy accused Nest\u2019s leadership of \u201cfetishizing only the most superfluous and negative traits of their mentors\u201d\u2014in other words, Fadell had emulated Steve Jobs\u2019 dark side but not his capacity for getting things done. Fadell, of course, rejected the charges: In his view, Duffy was acting out of line, while Nest was racking up accomplishments at Google\u2014a regular drumbeat of significant hardware redesigns and new software services. Fadell felt blindsided by Duffy and hamstrung by legal agreements restricting what he could say publicly: \u201cI was disappointed Google did not step up to the line when these personal attacks were made on me and Nest,\u201d he says. Furthermore, Google threatened Fadell with legal action if Fadell went ahead and defended himself in the press\u2014this tidbit according to the same source who saw the five-year runway clause in the original purchase agreement between Google and Nest. Alphabet, which politely declined to comment on what exactly went wrong at Nest, whether Fadell quit or was fired, or even if there was any runway agreement in the first place, vehemently denies threatening Fadell with legal action. Whatever really happened behind closed doors, we do know for certain that by June 2016, Fadell had returned to Paris for good. </p>    \n <div></div>  \n <div> \n  <p>\u201cAny VC who tells you that you have to move to Silicon Valley,\u201d Fadell says, gesticulating wildly, \u201cis being very lazy.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <div> Nadav Kander \n </div>   \n <p>Given that Fadell has tangled with major Silicon Valley companies and lost twice, it\u2019s hardly surprising that he decided to relocate to Paris. The surprising thing is that he may have found something better. At least that\u2019s the case Xavier Niel makes. Silicon Valley, Niel says, is for suckers. He ticks off the downsides: the sky-high salaries needed to attract engineers, the atrocious traffic, the relative dearth of cultural institutions, the isolation from the great cities of Europe \u2026 </p> \n <p>I am, to say the least, dubious: France is known for being unfavorable ground for businesses of all kinds\u2014especially startups. It has high taxes, rigid labor laws, and a culture that is averse to the free market. But I have to concede that Niel, a billionaire eight times over, is putting his money where his mouth is. He\u2019s making the case against Silicon Valley in the middle of Station F, a massive complex on the outskirts of Paris devoted exclusively to the care and feeding of startups. The building that houses it all is a former railroad terminal almost as long as the Eiffel Tower is tall and filled with a sea of desks\u2014more than 3,000 in all. Basically, it\u2019s a gargantuan coworking space, one that comes with all the amenities you\u2019d find in a big Silicon Valley company campus\u2014foosball tables, private conference rooms, fancy food courts, a chill zone, beanbag chairs. All of it is owned and operated by Niel.</p> \n <p>He operates as its landlord. Young entrepreneurs with an idea have to apply to get in, and if they do, they pay a nominal fee for a desk and plug-and-play access to the entire French entrepreneurial ecosystem. Looking down from all sides are offices of the permanent tenants: angel networks, VC firms, incubator and accelerator programs, outposts of large firms like Facebook and Microsoft looking to hire and acquire. Those tenants pay top dollar for the advantage of being in the same building with all the young guns.</p> \n <p>One of the nicest of the permanent offices belongs to Fadell. Future Shape, his fund, is now worth, he estimates, between $500 million and $1 billion. That\u2019s equivalent to a medium- or even large-size venture fund. But the difference is that, unlike a VC fund, Fadell doesn\u2019t have a bunch of limited partners backing him, tracking returns over (typically) a 10-year maturation period. Future Shape is all Fadell\u2019s money, so there\u2019s none of the usual VC pressure to IPO or be acquired. His personal balance sheet is not public, but financial lightning struck him twice: Both he and his wife got a bundle of Apple stock options back when AAPL was dirt cheap, and then he sold Nest to Google for $3.2 billion. \u201cIt\u2019s all covered,\u201d Fadell says, referring to his finances. \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d So the point of Future Shape, for Fadell, is finding those magic products\u2014like the iPhone or the Nest thermostat\u2014that need long runways but might change everything.</p> \n <p>\u201cAll of these incumbents with these big businesses that have been around for 100 or 200 years can be unseated,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cbecause technology is the unseating element, the levelizer.\u201d When Fadell talks about \u201ctechnology\u201d he means something a bit different than the usual definition. He waves off things like email and spreadsheets as mere bolt-ons to existing business models. His thesis is that almost every industry is up for grabs when and if someone like him redesigns the essential hardware with software and services baked in. It\u2019s the formula Fadell learned at General Magic and then applied at Apple and Nest. Everywhere he looks, he sees industries ripe for his particular brand of disruption: logistics and trucking, urban transportation, farming.</p> \n <p>It\u2019s an exceedingly familiar rap. Every venture fund claims that disruptive opportunity is everywhere\u2014it\u2019s the very premise of that type of investing\u2014and lots of them claim, for one reason or another, that they don\u2019t push their startups for exits.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <div>  \n  <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re launching a startup today, don\u2019t go to Silicon Valley if you\u2019re not from there,\u201d Fadell tells a group of students. \u201cDon\u2019t do it!\u201d</p>  \n </div> \n <p>Fadell indulges in one heresy, however: an insistence that you no longer need to throw yourself at the feet of the Silicon Valley masters, as he did 25 years ago. \u201cIf you\u2019re launching a startup today, don\u2019t go to Silicon Valley if you\u2019re not from there,\u201d Fadell tells a group of awestruck students at a coding school that feeds its graduates into Station F. \u201cDon\u2019t do it! You\u2019re at an incredible disadvantage.\u201d It is clear that he\u2019s also talking about himself.</p> \n <p> In fact, whatever the audience, whether it\u2019s coding kids or the founders of Founders Forum, Fadell never misses a chance to pooh-pooh the Valley. Fadell made a fortune in Silicon Valley and now has left it for good. He\u2019s putting down roots in Paris. He studies with a French tutor every day and is getting fluent. His two kids are enrolled in the local \u00e9cole , and the headquarters of Future Shape\u2014the new business\u2014are inside Station F. </p> \n <p> You don\u2019t need Freud to figure out why. Look past the big wallet and the big ego and you see a guy who has been grievously hurt by the Silicon Valley system\u2014exploited and then betrayed, twice. First by Steve Jobs, who squeezed Fadell for all the juice he had and then publicly tossed him aside. The second time it was the same shit, different company\u2014Fadell was again sucker-punched on the way out. The wave of bad publicity while he was at Nest\u2014the Recode memes, the Information  expos\u00e9\u2014came after Fadell told Page he wanted to leave Google. </p> \n <p>Sure, he might have failed altogether if it hadn\u2019t been for the support of Apple and Alphabet. And by one very important measure, Fadell succeeded stupendously, thanks to Silicon Valley: He walked away from both companies with huge piles of money. Maybe for mere mortals, money would be enough. But it wasn\u2019t for Jobs, who famously plotted and finally succeeded in winning back the control that Apple\u2019s early financiers took from him. Hardware is tough: Putting millions of things in the hands of millions of people requires large amounts of capital. And when someone gives you large amounts of capital, it often means you lose control. Elon Musk, who is two years younger than Fadell, is the first Silicon Valley hardware titan in generations to retain control of his inventions. Fadell seems to yearn to oversee his own dominion. This idea that he had to sell his babies is, I sense, what drives him.</p> \n <p>Fadell is almost pathologically compelled to say what\u2019s on his mind, and never in the week I spent shadowing him did he say anything that smacked of self-pity. But by the end of the week, it was clear what this third act of his career is about. He\u2019s trying to challenge a Silicon Valley\u00adcentric system that separated him from his creations.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <div>  \n  <p>In Paris, he can pick out younger versions of himself, give them money and watch all the possible versions of his life story unfold again and again.</p>  \n </div> \n <p>In France, Fadell has a mini-\u00adreplica of Silicon Valley outside the Future Shape door. It\u2019s a place where he can pick out younger versions of himself, give them money, and\u2014in a sense\u2014watch all the possible versions of his own life story unfold again and again. \u201cMy job is to come here and bring Silicon Valley here,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s that cultural element that people are trying to replicate around the world, of taking risks and believing in yourself and changing the world, and there\u2019s no reason it can only be done in Silicon Valley.\u201d Fadell is the vector, the human tissue culture in a grand cloning experiment\u2014as well as the experimenter, tweaking the rules.</p> \n <p>What I see is a guy trying to prove to Silicon Valley that his way was the right way all along\u2014with the irony that he\u2019s trying to make that case in a high-tax country that has, so far, produced very few high tech companies of note. But who knows? It might just work. Station F is not some government-\u00adhatched \u201cdevelopment\u201d plan but rather the private gamble of a self-made tech billionaire, and Niel\u2019s stated goal is to have it pump out a thousand additional startups a year into what is one of Europe\u2019s biggest startup cities. \u201cIt\u2019s the ambition of all the people here, including Tony, as well as our new president Macron\u201d\u2014the young French president has met with both Fadell and Niel\u2014\u201cto help this ecosystem become huge.\u201d</p> \n <p>As for Fadell\u2019s Future Shape, it already includes chunks of some of the more promising non\u2013Silicon Valley companies going\u2014Superpedestrian in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Modern Meadow in Nutley, New Jersey; Convargo in Paris; DICE in London; CashShield in Singapore\u2014and to a person their CEOs have described Fadell\u2019s behind-the-scenes help as invaluable. Judging by the idolization that Fadell gets from young French coders, Future Shape will undoubtedly get early access to the startups that will emerge from Station F and elsewhere. His rock-star status is probably his main advantage as an investor. Will it be enough to beat Valley VCs at their own game? We\u2019ll see.</p> \n <p>But in another sense, Fadell\u2019s big bet on Paris has already paid off. Spiritually, he\u2019s back home\u2014to that Midwestern place where he was before he was sucked into Silicon Valley\u2019s vortex. He calls his own shots. He\u2019s a big fish in a small pond. He\u2019s in control. And this time around, Silicon Valley comes to him. \u201cTony meets more American tech people in Paris than in the US,\u201d Niel says. \u201cBecause if you are a big US tech manager, you come to Paris at least one or two times a year\u2014and when they do, they all call Tony!\u201d</p> \n <p>By all means, when you come to Paris, you should definitely look Fadell up. He\u2019s a wild man, a maverick, a bull in a china shop, and a lot of fun. But take one bit of advice from me: Whatever you do, don\u2019t let him borrow your phone.</p>  \n</div>",
        "text": "Tony Fadell isat the Grove, a spectacularly beautiful country estate outside of London. The event is Founders Forum: the ultra \u00adexclusive invite-only tech conference. Prince William is in the house. The guest list is lousy with knights and lesser officers of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. Marissa Mayer, the now ex-CEO of Yahoo, and Biz Stone, recently returned to Twitter, are mingling with the other hundred or so invitees. But this is really Fadell\u2019s moment. It\u2019s almost exactly 10 years since the iPhone was released, and the media buzz is inescapable. The press is having trouble coming up with superlatives to describe the impact of a device that has sold more than a billion units. A new book, The One Device, is lighting up the intertubes with fresh gossip about \u201cthe secret history of the iPhone.\u201d And Fadell\u2014both the source and the subject of that gossip\u2014is getting his due as one of the guys most responsible for turning Steve Jobs\u2019 one-device-to-rule-them-all vision into reality. The title of the afternoon session is \u201cWhat to Build Next?\u201d and Fadell is onstage with two other bona fide tech zillionaires\u2014Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m, the Skype guy; and Kevin Ryan, one of New York City\u2019s most successful internet entrepreneurs\u2014as well as a couple of other founder-\u00adinvestor types. Of the five people onstage, Fadell is the only one who helped build an object that every person in the audience has most likely used at one time or another. First Fadell helped build the iPod for Apple, then the iPhone, and then he ventured out on his own to build the Nest thermostat. Fadell is the star of the show, and he knows it. His self-confidence is well earned but can come across as overweening\u2014especially to those who suddenly find themselves in his shadow. \u201cAny VC who tells you that you have to move to Silicon Valley,\u201d Fadell says at one point, gesticulating wildly, \u201cis being very lazy.\u201d Two of the other people onstage are, in fact, from Silicon Valley venture capital firms, and their collars seem to squeeze a bit tighter. Fadell, in comparison, is supremely comfortable: relaxed and expansive in a pair of bright red sneakers\u2014no socks\u2014and a polo shirt. The moderator, wrapping things up, calls for a lightning round: a rapid-fire series of questions\u2014with only one-word answers allowed.

One Startup Finds Out How Silicon Valley Utopianism Brought You the Dystopian Trump Presidency What\u2019s the biggest problem facing the world right now? \u201cClimate,\u201d Fadell says. Then he adds, \u201cWe\u2019regoingtohavetogonuclear \u2026\u201d before being hushed by the moderator for busting the one-word rule. What\u2019s the next big thing in tech? \u201cComputational synthetic biology,\u201d Fadell says, bending the rules a second time. What is the one word that people who know you would use to describe you? With that, the panel is over, and Fadell is mobbed as he tries to leave the Grove\u2019s 18th-century manor. People want autographs, selfies, a word or two\u2014but the most persistent want money and advice. Like many of his contemporaries, Fadell makes personal investments as an angel, through a firm called Future Shape, with one important difference: He says he has a venture-size pool of money\u2014a portfolio of Future Shape investments worth more than half a billion dollars. Looking to make his escape, Fadell slips into the men\u2019s room. One persistent supplicant follows and, while Fadell is standing at the urinal, penis in hand, proceeds to make his pitch. It\u2019s a startup with a new design for a robotic arm. Fadell listens for less than a minute and, shaking off, says: \u201cA new robot arm? China is going to copy that in a second! What then? What\u2019s your value proposition?\u201d Faster, better, cheaper \u2026 blah blah blah. \u201cNot good enough!\u201d Fadell thinks, before offering some bland words of encouragement and dashing off to slip into the back seat of a black Mercedes-Benz S-class emblazoned with the AMG performance badge. As we start to speed toward central London to catch the afternoon Eurostar to Paris, he entertains the chauffeur (and me) with the penis-pitch story. \u201cI did like his persistence, though,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cI respect that.\u201d Turning philosophical, Fadell puts on his shades against the bright sun streaming through the backseat sunroof. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like being a film producer,\u201d he says, reflecting on his new role, post-Nest, as an investor. People pitch him, and if he likes their idea, it\u2019s go time. As if on cue, Fadell is forced to cut his reverie short to take a call from a young journalist doing a story on \u201cthe new culture of celebrity in tech.\u201d Did you ever think that tech would make you into a celebrity? \u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Fadell says. \u201cThe tech business in the \u201980s was Revenge of the Nerds. It was geeks. We were looked down upon, trodden upon \u2026\u201d Fadell is working himself into his trademark lather. \u201c\u2009\u2018Who are these crazy guys with pocket protectors and broken glasses?\u2019\u2009\u201d he asks rhetorically. \u201cSo you never thought that you were going to become a rock star,\u201d Fadell says, winding down, before quickly amending the thought. \u201cNot that I am,\u201d he says, \u201cbut that\u2019s what some people think.\u201d I don\u2019t think Fadell is a rock star, but I\u2019m quickly realizing that he is not your run-of-the-mill Silicon Valley billionaire making an early retirement out of an investing hobby either. For starters, he doesn\u2019t even live in the Valley anymore. He has moved to Paris. Permanently. And the more I learn about him, the more I begin to suspect that Silicon Valley\u2019s favorite son secretly hates the Valley. To hear Fadell tell it, he certainly has reason to. Rewind to theearly \u201990s. Fadell, a computer engineering major at the University of Michigan, has already tasted entrepreneurial success with a little education-software company called Constructive Instruments that he founded in his dorm room, but he wants more. \u201cI was getting very frustrated being a big fish in a little pond in Ann Arbor,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cand my eyes were looking at the West going, Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley.\u201d For a technologist like Fadell, there was no other place. Then, when news broke that a handful of Apple alumni\u2014including the hero-programmer behind the Mac, Andy Hertzfeld\u2014had escaped the mothership and banded together to form a new company, General Magic, Fadell saw his future. Not long after graduating in 1991, he showed up at General Magic\u2019s offices in Mountain View, California, early one midweek morning, unannounced. And because he was there before the receptionist, he just started wandering the halls, uncomfortable in his jacket and tie, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in hand. He eventually found some people to pester\u2014people who had clearly been there all night, hacking away. Leave us alone, kid. \u201cI was humbled in the first 10 minutes of being there,\u201d he says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, this is not like Michigan, I have got to be here, these are the smartest people ever, I have got to be working here. I have to be working here.\u2019\u201d The young Fadell had persistence, and it paid off: By the end of 1991 he had a job offer from General Magic. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have said, back then, \u2018This guy\u2019s going to change the world,\u2019 particularly,\u201d Hertzfeld says. \u201cHe was incredibly talented, very opinionated, obviously very bright, and physically very strong.\u201d At General Magic, Fadell joined a small team that was trying to build something the company had labeled a personal communicator. \u201cIt had email. It had downloadable apps. It had shopping. It had animations and graphics and games. It had telecommunications\u2014a phone, a built-in modem,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cIt was the iPhone 14 years too soon.\u201d It never got off the ground, and Magic ran out of tricks and cash by the early 2000s, but the experience was formative. \u201cHardware, software, services. That was the first link that I ever saw like that,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cThat has influenced everything I\u2019ve done since.\u201d A few years after leaving General Magic, Fadell had his own startup, Fuse Systems. It was a hardware company that was attempting to capitalize on the Napster-\u00adfueled rise of the MP3 music format. Yves B\u00e9har, the noted product designer, remembers working with the nascent company: The idea was to make a full line of MP3-optimized music players\u2014everything from a component stereo system to a small portable Walkman-type device. \u201cTony was talking about a world where media, especially music, was going to be all digital,\u201d B\u00e9har says. \u201cAnd he got so excited and animated and passionate that he broke a chair\u2014he was just very physical, getting up and sitting down again\u2014and that became a joke: Tony\u2019s a kind of excitable guy who breaks the furniture.\u201d To get the idea off the ground, Fadell rented an office in San Francisco\u2019s Telegraph Hill neighborhood and hired about a dozen people. Then Apple called. This was just after Jobs had returned to the company he founded and was struggling to save it from oblivion. Jobs was looking for a way out of a no-win battle with Microsoft and, like Fadell, had hit upon the idea of a portable MP3 player. Toshiba had just announced the launch of a small-\u00adformat disk drive that would give the Apple MP3 player a crucial advantage over the competition. But Apple needed someone who knew the tech forward and backward to build out a prototype. Executives asked him to come in to discuss something\u2014they were cagey about exactly what. Fadell assumed Apple needed some help designing a next-gen Newton and took the meeting. It was only after he signed the nondisclosure agreements that he discovered that the company wanted him to design a portable MP3 player\u2014the future iPod. In effect, Apple was asking Fadell for help in competing with himself. Yet if Fuse were to have any chance of survival, Fadell had to take the consulting gig at Apple, because Fuse needed another infusion of cash. The traditional sources of funding had shut down because the dotcom crash was already under way. Fadell put Fuse on autopilot and designed the iPod prototype for Apple in six short weeks. After he demonstrated how the iPod could be built\u2014which components, which interfaces, and at what price\u2014Jobs put Fadell into a double bind. He asked him to abandon the Fuse MP3 player designs and develop his idea inside Apple, which would mean killing his own company. It was agonizing for the young entrepreneur. \u201cI was just like, whoa!\u201d says Fadell, who even now gets worked up at the thought. \u201cI am like, \u2018Wait a second, I have a company, and there are people over there working on this other thing. How am I going to do this?\u2019 So I just got in my car, and I started driving through the hills of Saratoga and Los Gatos. I go up to Skyline, I wind up those roads, and I\u2019m just sitting there going, \u2018What am I going to do? What am I doing?\u2019\u201d In the end, Fadell didn\u2019t have much of a choice. The odds of Fuse succeeding on its own were not good. So he put his own dreams in a box and went to work for Apple as the head of the iPod project. The first iPod was not perfect, but it was still way better than the competition\u2014and as it was refined, it grew into a monster hit. Steve Wozniak, who watched it all happen from the inside, credits the iPod with turning the entire company around. \u201cIt made our revenues double, our profits double, and our stock double,\u201d he says. The iPod was a hit, and Fadell was a hero inside Apple. When Jobs announced that he had cancer in 2004, Fadell was on every list of potential successors. He even reminded people of the mercurial Apple founder, both in his ability to get things done and in the way he operated. \u201cTony is a little bit like Steve Jobs in the way he shaded the truth,\u201d says Hertzfeld, who was close to both men. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly lying, but it\u2019s expressing things in an advantageous way.\u201d The iPhone, which came out in 2007, was Fadell\u2019s last chapter at Apple. As the guy who built the iPod, he had earned the right to shape the company\u2019s next flagship product. The phone project started in earnest at the end of 2004. By that time, Fadell and his team had prototyped iPods that could also make phone calls. Fadell\u2019s design used the iPod\u2019s circular controller like a rotary dial. But there was another team inside Apple with a bigger idea\u2014the all-touch screen. And the competition between the two teams at times escalated into full-on corporate warfare. \u201cTony started to adopt Steve Jobs\u2019 mannerisms and persona because it was a pressure cooker\u2014but also you emulate what works, right? And so everyone started screaming at each other.\u201d Fadell lost the battle over the iPhone\u2019s final design\u2014but, because of his previous success, he was still expected to build the hardware, a power-sharing situation that created all kinds of drama with Scott Forstall, Apple\u2019s legendary software guru. \u201cThis is when Steve\u2019s leadership and management style started to permeate the company,\u201d remembers Andy Grignon, the manager responsible for the \u201cphone\u201d part of the iPhone. \u201cTony started to adopt Steve\u2019s mannerisms and persona because it was a pressure cooker\u2014but also you emulate what works, right? And so everyone started screaming at each other. It became just like the thing to do: Fly off the fucking handle.\u201d And by the time the iPhone was ready to launch, it seemed Fadell was no longer the golden boy. Jobs appeared to confirm this fact in an exceptionally cruel way: The message was signaled from the stage at the very event where the iPhone was unveiled, on January 9, 2007. When Jobs was demonstrating the iPhone\u2019s contact list, he showed that he could delete a contact with one tap\u2014and the contact he deleted was \u201cTony Fadell.\u201d The public may not have thought twice about the gesture, but the Apple engineers in the audience understood exactly what was going on. \u201cPeople laughed about it, but everybody knew,\u201d Grignon says. \u201cSteve was in many ways diabolical, and Tony and Steve\u2019s relationship had grown increasingly rocky.\u201d Fadell insists that his relationship with Jobs remained solid, but he seems to have been pretty decisively outmaneuvered. \u201cThat demo script,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cwas created by Scott Forstall.\u201d (A source closely involved with the presentation says Jobs was ad-libbing.) Fadell and his wife, Danielle Lambert, also an Apple employee, eventually decided they\u2019d had enough and were gone by November 2008. Fadell says they left to spend more time with their kids. \u201cSteve was wondering why we didn\u2019t do it sooner,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cAnd then for a year, year and a half, we kind of went around the world.\u201d The city they liked best was Paris, so there they settled. They bought a big, beautiful apartment in the seventh arrondissement, started filling it with contemporary art, and enrolled their eldest son in the local school. Fadell is in full manic panic, and those are the first words out of his mouth as I step into his garden courtyard in the seventh. It\u2019s early in the morning, the day after Founders Forum in London, and I\u2019m being escorted onto the premises by Fadell\u2019s PR person. Today she has scheduled Fadell for a long sit-down interview with me. But all of that has been forgotten, as Fadell has just been hit with some disturbing news. \u201cFucking Apple,\u201d he says. Fadell clams up after this outburst, but I later hear there is a dispute brewing between one of the Future Shape companies and Apple. Fadell has invested in hundreds of startup companies, and I have no idea which of them is butting heads with Apple. However, I do glean enough to understand that there is nothing unusual about the morning\u2019s drama. Fadell is a drama king: The more drama, the better. In fact, Fadell\u2019s PR person is a specialist in what has come to be called crisis PR, and she tells me that with Fadell, \u201cevery day is a new adventure.\u201d Indeed, the next thing I hear from Fadell is that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to go now.\u201d He has decided that, instead of sitting down for the interview this morning, he has to make an appearance at VivaTech\u2014the TechCrunch of Europe. He points to a pair of bikes waiting in the courtyard, outfitted with a device that gives them an electric boost. The devices are from a startup called Superpedestrian, and Fadell is an investor. The bet on e-bikes is emblematic of the types of investments he\u2019s looking for. He tends to like hardware startups. He looks for industries that are very stable, where the basic designs, tools, or materials have barely changed for a long time. Consider Modern Meadow, a Future Shape portfolio company, which is trying to replace cow leather with a lab-grown substitute. Then there\u2019s a heating and cooling company aiming to replace every compressor in every industrial refrigerator in the world with a solid-state thermoelectric cooler\u2014a chip, in essence. In Fadell\u2019s mind, the ultimate triumph would be a breakthrough battery: \u201cIf we have energy storage technologies that are very cheap and very efficient, then we\u2019re going to see wars stop, because no one is going to be fighting over oil reserves anymore.\u201d We each take a bike and head into traffic, riding south on Boulevard Saint-Germain and then merging into traffic to veer onto Boulevard Raspail. Fadell has our destination\u2014the Paris Expo center\u2014dialed into his iPhone. It\u2019s only 4 miles away, but we are going to have to sprint to get there in time. There\u2019s only one problem: \u201cMy boost doesn\u2019t work!\u201d Fadell says. No matter, he just stands up on his pedals and grinds like a bike messenger who has just guzzled a gallon of espresso. Keeping up is not easy, even with my Superpedestrian-assisted superlegs, because Fadell is blowing through red lights, splitting lanes, squeezing through wormholes in moving traffic. And doing it all one-handed so he can keep an eye on the map. \u201cWatch out for cops, OK?\u201d he says as we blast through another busy intersection. \u201cIf they see me riding with my phone out, it\u2019s an automatic ticket.\u201d We\u2019re cranking, running with traffic on the Rue de Rennes, and then the second technical fail strikes. \u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d Fadell grunts, glaring at his screen while spinning his crankset madly. \u201cMy phone is only at 50 percent charge. It was full when we left this morning.\u201d \u201cYou need to be able to jack it into that battery in the bike,\u201d I say, offering an unsolicited design critique. \u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201d he says, leaning into a chicane designed to slow traffic. A left, a right. The streets are getting wider: four lanes, then six. Traffic is moving faster and faster. Fadell is starting to sweat. \u201cI need to reboot. There\u2019s a bug in the phone. It\u2019s sucking power,\u201d he says. We glide to a stop at the edge of a deserted plaza near a train station so Fadell can reboot his iPhone. The reboot doesn\u2019t fix the bug. \u201cSuch is the life of a digital citizen,\u201d he sighs. I have an idea: I hand him my Android so he can continue to navigate, and we are off again. It\u2019s all downhill from here, and soon we are on a paved bike path. Fadell narrowly escapes a head-on collision with a helmeted mountain biker while trying to get his bearings from the unfamiliar phone. We\u2019ve got gravity at our back, trees to our left, and pedestrians to our right. We\u2019re laying down a groove in a dedicated bike lane carved out of an impossibly wide Parisian sidewalk. \u201cIt says we\u2019re here! Do you see it? It\u2019s just to our left somewhere,\u201d Fadell says, craning his neck, looking for the Expo center. Fadell\u2019s front wheel goes kerflooey against a half-inch granite curb delineating the edge of the bike lane, and he\u2019s thrown to the ground. The bicyclist behind us swerves to avoid the crash and curses at Fadell while he\u2019s down, splayed over his crumpled bike: \u201cMerde!\u201d My phone is yards away, having escaped Fadell\u2019s grip when he went flying. The screen is shattered. Fadell has dirt stains on the knees of his white jeans. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to put this in the story, are you?\u201d Fadell asks. Fadell never misses a chance to pooh-pooh the Valley. He made a fortune in Silicon Valley and now has left it for good. He\u2019s putting down roots in Paris. Nadav Kander The one problemwith moving to Paris was that Fadell had no real network there. Then he met Xavier Niel\u2014a man sometimes referred to as \u201cthe French Steve Jobs.\u201d He made his money as an internet entrepreneur and now, like Fadell, invests it. \u201cI was reading blogs and stuff, but I wanted to talk to other people in the business,\u201d Fadell tells me. \u201cAt the time, Paris wasn\u2019t a big tech city,\u201d says Niel, who recalls meeting Fadell early one afternoon in his office in 2009. It was a blind date bromance, and they talked for almost 10 hours straight. \u201cOh my God, we just bonded instantly,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cWe had similar backgrounds, just in different countries. He had an Apple II, I had an Apple II.\u201d \u201cWe spoke a lot about electronics \u2026\u201d Niel says. Fadell had an idea about a company of his own and was looking for collaborators. \u201cNest was burning inside me to be created,\u201d he says. Niel was an early investor. The Nest elevator pitch: home thermostat meets the iPhone. Nest was never simply about making a smarter, more beautiful thermostat, any more than the iPhone was about making a smarter, more beautiful phone. The business pitch was that, someday soon, every device in the average house\u2014every lock, appliance, power outlet, and light switch\u2014would be replaced by a fancy cloud-\u00adconnected gizmo. And what would connect this so-called internet of things? Who would provide the operating system to the houses and apartments we would all be living in? Well, Nest of course. Fadell moved back to Silicon Valley to build it with Matt Rogers, who had been Fadell\u2019s colleague at Apple. The company was incorporated in June 2010 and was in stealth mode for more than a year. Google\u2019s Sergey Brin saw a prototype early in 2011 and immediately moved to buy the company. Fadell said no. Steve Jobs heard about the thermostat and wanted to see it too, but by the time Fadell felt it was perfect enough to show to the perfectionist, Jobs was on his deathbed. He never saw it. The Nest thermostat debuted at the end of 2011 and earned Nest a raft of plaudits and design awards, and all the attention was making Fadell nervous. \u201cI have seen this before,\u201d he says, \u201cwhere you\u2019re the biggest fish in the smaller pond, and then all of a sudden the pond grows immensely because Google or Microsoft or Apple or Amazon or Samsung gets into it, and now you\u2019re a very tiny fish with these big, big, big whales.\u201d By the summer of 2013, the second product in the Nest family, a smart smoke detector, was about to come out, and Fadell was looking to raise more money through an investment round. \u201cWe had connected products, but what we wanted to do was connect the whole thing together. That was the vision of Nest. So how much money was it going to take?\u201d Fadell asks. The answer: a ton of money\u2014and time too. Meanwhile, Google was still interested in buying the company outright. Nest was starting to look like the key that could unlock a gazillion-dollar \u201cconnected home\u201d market, and acquiring Fadell seemed to be a chance to inject Google with some of the design DNA that had made Apple the most valuable company in the world. Fadell was pressed hard against the same dilemma he\u2019d faced at Fuse a decade earlier. He could bet everything on himself and risk losing\u2014or he could try to pursue his vision inside the confines of a warm corporate cocoon. This time the double bind wasn\u2019t so heartbreaking. Fadell wouldn\u2019t have to kill his company, because Nest would effectively live inside Google. Fadell could keep control while drawing on all the Google infrastructure he needed to build Nest into a connected-home platform. \u201cAll kinds of promises were made,\u201d Fadell says. Including, according to a source who saw the contract, a five-year \u201crunway\u201d\u2014a period of time in which Nest could spend and innovate freely with the goal of capturing the entire connected-\u00adhome ecosystem that everyone knew was coming. In January 2014, Google acquired Nest for $3.2 billion. Five months later, Google bought Dropcam, a smart home-security-camera company. The plan was to do some modifications, rebrand the system, and add the \u201cnew\u201d Nest Cam into Fadell\u2019s product line. That\u2019s what happened, but not before the former Dropcam CEO, Greg Duffy, attempted a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat early in 2015. According to an article on the news site The Information, Duffy sent an email to Google CEO Larry Page complaining about Fadell, his boss at Nest. He also recommended that Fadell be fired and suggested that he himself should replace Fadell. When Duffy\u2019s insubordinate power play got no response from Page, he quit Nest and, for good measure, says he told Fadell, \u201cI think you\u2019re running this company like a tyrant bureaucrat!\u201d before walking out. There\u2019s definitely a tyrannical streak in Fadell\u2014in a heated moment Fadell once asked his cofounder, Rogers, to postpone his honeymoon to help the Nest team meet some deadlines. (Rogers knew the storm would pass and took his honeymoon as scheduled.) But Fadell\u2019s real problem wasn\u2019t his so-called tyranny\u2014it was the new bureaucracy he suddenly found himself in. The month after Duffy transferred out of Nest, becoming an \u201centrepreneur in residence\u201d deep inside the Google death star, Ruth Porat was hired as Google\u2019s new CFO. Porat had deep roots in Silicon Valley\u2014her brother, Marc, was Fadell\u2019s boss at General Magic\u2014but Porat came from Wall Street. She was hired to bring financial discipline to Google. And indeed, within five months, Google announced that it was no longer \u201cGoogle\u201d anymore. It was Alphabet, a holding company that would contain at least a dozen divisions. There would be the core search-and-\u00adadvertising company called \u201cGoogle\u201d as well as what Alphabet called its \u201cother bets.\u201d Nest was one of the other bets, and as a division Nest would have to meet certain revenue goals, and its balance sheet would suddenly be subject to large overhead and other indirect charges from Alphabet. Fadell remembers the moment vividly. He thought he had a promise: five years in which to build Nest into the dominant connected-\u00adhome platform. But everything changed when Google morphed into Alphabet. \u201cThey decided there was a new regime in town, and they said, \u2018We\u2019re going to have all new metrics,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018This is not what we agreed to before,\u2019 because this was not just about fiscal things\u2014it was about getting married. I had never thought about being bought. It was about getting married to build a beautiful child, right?\u201d Fadell soldiered on under the new regime for four months, until at the end of 2015 he discovered that the new bottom-line-oriented Alphabet was going to sell Nest. \u201cAt that point I knew it wasn\u2019t going to work out, and that\u2019s when I came home to my wife, after a lot of struggles with the Alphabet thing. It wasn\u2019t working, it was, OK, it\u2019s over.\u201d Things went south after Fadell told Page that he wanted out in December of 2015. The tech blogs started circling, and the famously tight-lipped Google started leaking. Recode got ahold of a meme, created by someone inside the company, that showed a cartoon mob, torches raised high, behind the words \u201csell nest.\u201d The Information did a damning expos\u00e9, featuring Duffy\u2019s version of Nest as a bloated, ineffectual organization. In a follow-up blog post, Duffy accused Nest\u2019s leadership of \u201cfetishizing only the most superfluous and negative traits of their mentors\u201d\u2014in other words, Fadell had emulated Steve Jobs\u2019 dark side but not his capacity for getting things done. Fadell, of course, rejected the charges: In his view, Duffy was acting out of line, while Nest was racking up accomplishments at Google\u2014a regular drumbeat of significant hardware redesigns and new software services. Fadell felt blindsided by Duffy and hamstrung by legal agreements restricting what he could say publicly: \u201cI was disappointed Google did not step up to the line when these personal attacks were made on me and Nest,\u201d he says. Furthermore, Google threatened Fadell with legal action if Fadell went ahead and defended himself in the press\u2014this tidbit according to the same source who saw the five-year runway clause in the original purchase agreement between Google and Nest. Alphabet, which politely declined to comment on what exactly went wrong at Nest, whether Fadell quit or was fired, or even if there was any runway agreement in the first place, vehemently denies threatening Fadell with legal action. Whatever really happened behind closed doors, we do know for certain that by June 2016, Fadell had returned to Paris for good. \u201cAny VC who tells you that you have to move to Silicon Valley,\u201d Fadell says, gesticulating wildly, \u201cis being very lazy.\u201d Nadav Kander Given that Fadellhas tangled with major Silicon Valley companies and lost twice, it\u2019s hardly surprising that he decided to relocate to Paris. The surprising thing is that he may have found something better. At least that\u2019s the case Xavier Niel makes. Silicon Valley, Niel says, is for suckers. He ticks off the downsides: the sky-high salaries needed to attract engineers, the atrocious traffic, the relative dearth of cultural institutions, the isolation from the great cities of Europe \u2026 I am, to say the least, dubious: France is known for being unfavorable ground for businesses of all kinds\u2014especially startups. It has high taxes, rigid labor laws, and a culture that is averse to the free market. But I have to concede that Niel, a billionaire eight times over, is putting his money where his mouth is. He\u2019s making the case against Silicon Valley in the middle of Station F, a massive complex on the outskirts of Paris devoted exclusively to the care and feeding of startups. The building that houses it all is a former railroad terminal almost as long as the Eiffel Tower is tall and filled with a sea of desks\u2014more than 3,000 in all. Basically, it\u2019s a gargantuan coworking space, one that comes with all the amenities you\u2019d find in a big Silicon Valley company campus\u2014foosball tables, private conference rooms, fancy food courts, a chill zone, beanbag chairs. All of it is owned and operated by Niel. He operates as its landlord. Young entrepreneurs with an idea have to apply to get in, and if they do, they pay a nominal fee for a desk and plug-and-play access to the entire French entrepreneurial ecosystem. Looking down from all sides are offices of the permanent tenants: angel networks, VC firms, incubator and accelerator programs, outposts of large firms like Facebook and Microsoft looking to hire and acquire. Those tenants pay top dollar for the advantage of being in the same building with all the young guns. One of the nicest of the permanent offices belongs to Fadell. Future Shape, his fund, is now worth, he estimates, between $500 million and $1 billion. That\u2019s equivalent to a medium- or even large-size venture fund. But the difference is that, unlike a VC fund, Fadell doesn\u2019t have a bunch of limited partners backing him, tracking returns over (typically) a 10-year maturation period. Future Shape is all Fadell\u2019s money, so there\u2019s none of the usual VC pressure to IPO or be acquired. His personal balance sheet is not public, but financial lightning struck him twice: Both he and his wife got a bundle of Apple stock options back when AAPL was dirt cheap, and then he sold Nest to Google for $3.2 billion. \u201cIt\u2019s all covered,\u201d Fadell says, referring to his finances. \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d So the point of Future Shape, for Fadell, is finding those magic products\u2014like the iPhone or the Nest thermostat\u2014that need long runways but might change everything. \u201cAll of these incumbents with these big businesses that have been around for 100 or 200 years can be unseated,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cbecause technology is the unseating element, the levelizer.\u201d When Fadell talks about \u201ctechnology\u201d he means something a bit different than the usual definition. He waves off things like email and spreadsheets as mere bolt-ons to existing business models. His thesis is that almost every industry is up for grabs when and if someone like him redesigns the essential hardware with software and services baked in. It\u2019s the formula Fadell learned at General Magic and then applied at Apple and Nest. Everywhere he looks, he sees industries ripe for his particular brand of disruption: logistics and trucking, urban transportation, farming. It\u2019s an exceedingly familiar rap. Every venture fund claims that disruptive opportunity is everywhere\u2014it\u2019s the very premise of that type of investing\u2014and lots of them claim, for one reason or another, that they don\u2019t push their startups for exits. \u201cIf you\u2019re launching a startup today, don\u2019t go to Silicon Valley if you\u2019re not from there,\u201d Fadell tells a group of students. \u201cDon\u2019t do it!\u201d Fadell indulges in one heresy, however: an insistence that you no longer need to throw yourself at the feet of the Silicon Valley masters, as he did 25 years ago. \u201cIf you\u2019re launching a startup today, don\u2019t go to Silicon Valley if you\u2019re not from there,\u201d Fadell tells a group of awestruck students at a coding school that feeds its graduates into Station F. \u201cDon\u2019t do it! You\u2019re at an incredible disadvantage.\u201d It is clear that he\u2019s also talking about himself. In fact, whatever the audience, whether it\u2019s coding kids or the founders of Founders Forum, Fadell never misses a chance to pooh-pooh the Valley. Fadell made a fortune in Silicon Valley and now has left it for good. He\u2019s putting down roots in Paris. He studies with a French tutor every day and is getting fluent. His two kids are enrolled in the local \u00e9cole, and the headquarters of Future Shape\u2014the new business\u2014are inside Station F. You don\u2019t need Freud to figure out why. Look past the big wallet and the big ego and you see a guy who has been grievously hurt by the Silicon Valley system\u2014exploited and then betrayed, twice. First by Steve Jobs, who squeezed Fadell for all the juice he had and then publicly tossed him aside. The second time it was the same shit, different company\u2014Fadell was again sucker-punched on the way out. The wave of bad publicity while he was at Nest\u2014the Recode memes, the Information expos\u00e9\u2014came after Fadell told Page he wanted to leave Google. Sure, he might have failed altogether if it hadn\u2019t been for the support of Apple and Alphabet. And by one very important measure, Fadell succeeded stupendously, thanks to Silicon Valley: He walked away from both companies with huge piles of money. Maybe for mere mortals, money would be enough. But it wasn\u2019t for Jobs, who famously plotted and finally succeeded in winning back the control that Apple\u2019s early financiers took from him. Hardware is tough: Putting millions of things in the hands of millions of people requires large amounts of capital. And when someone gives you large amounts of capital, it often means you lose control. Elon Musk, who is two years younger than Fadell, is the first Silicon Valley hardware titan in generations to retain control of his inventions. Fadell seems to yearn to oversee his own dominion. This idea that he had to sell his babies is, I sense, what drives him. Fadell is almost pathologically compelled to say what\u2019s on his mind, and never in the week I spent shadowing him did he say anything that smacked of self-pity. But by the end of the week, it was clear what this third act of his career is about. He\u2019s trying to challenge a Silicon Valley\u00adcentric system that separated him from his creations. In Paris, he can pick out younger versions of himself, give them money and watch all the possible versions of his life story unfold again and again. In France, Fadell has a mini-\u00adreplica of Silicon Valley outside the Future Shape door. It\u2019s a place where he can pick out younger versions of himself, give them money, and\u2014in a sense\u2014watch all the possible versions of his own life story unfold again and again. \u201cMy job is to come here and bring Silicon Valley here,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s that cultural element that people are trying to replicate around the world, of taking risks and believing in yourself and changing the world, and there\u2019s no reason it can only be done in Silicon Valley.\u201d Fadell is the vector, the human tissue culture in a grand cloning experiment\u2014as well as the experimenter, tweaking the rules. What I see is a guy trying to prove to Silicon Valley that his way was the right way all along\u2014with the irony that he\u2019s trying to make that case in a high-tax country that has, so far, produced very few high tech companies of note. But who knows? It might just work. Station F is not some government-\u00adhatched \u201cdevelopment\u201d plan but rather the private gamble of a self-made tech billionaire, and Niel\u2019s stated goal is to have it pump out a thousand additional startups a year into what is one of Europe\u2019s biggest startup cities. \u201cIt\u2019s the ambition of all the people here, including Tony, as well as our new president Macron\u201d\u2014the young French president has met with both Fadell and Niel\u2014\u201cto help this ecosystem become huge.\u201d As for Fadell\u2019s Future Shape, it already includes chunks of some of the more promising non\u2013Silicon Valley companies going\u2014Superpedestrian in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Modern Meadow in Nutley, New Jersey; Convargo in Paris; DICE in London; CashShield in Singapore\u2014and to a person their CEOs have described Fadell\u2019s behind-the-scenes help as invaluable. Judging by the idolization that Fadell gets from young French coders, Future Shape will undoubtedly get early access to the startups that will emerge from Station F and elsewhere. His rock-star status is probably his main advantage as an investor. Will it be enough to beat Valley VCs at their own game? We\u2019ll see. But in another sense, Fadell\u2019s big bet on Paris has already paid off. Spiritually, he\u2019s back home\u2014to that Midwestern place where he was before he was sucked into Silicon Valley\u2019s vortex. He calls his own shots. He\u2019s a big fish in a small pond. He\u2019s in control. And this time around, Silicon Valley comes to him. \u201cTony meets more American tech people in Paris than in the US,\u201d Niel says. \u201cBecause if you are a big US tech manager, you come to Paris at least one or two times a year\u2014and when they do, they all call Tony!\u201d By all means, when you come to Paris, you should definitely look Fadell up. He\u2019s a wild man, a maverick, a bull in a china shop, and a lot of fun. But take one bit of advice from me: Whatever you do, don\u2019t let him borrow your phone.",

        "structuredText": "<div>   \n <p>Tony Fadell is at the Grove, a spectacularly beautiful country estate outside of London. The event is Founders Forum: the ultra \u00adexclusive invite-only tech conference. Prince William is in the house. The guest list is lousy with knights and lesser officers of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. Marissa Mayer, the now ex-CEO of Yahoo, and Biz Stone, recently returned to Twitter, are mingling with the other hundred or so invitees. But this is really Fadell\u2019s moment. </p> \n <p> It\u2019s almost exactly 10 years since the iPhone was released, and the media buzz is inescapable. The press is having trouble coming up with superlatives to describe the impact of a device that has sold more than a billion units. A new book, <a href=\"http://a.co/6TplyWy\">The One Device</a> , is lighting up the intertubes with fresh gossip about \u201cthe secret history of the iPhone.\u201d And Fadell\u2014both the source and the subject of that gossip\u2014is getting his due as one of the guys most responsible for turning Steve Jobs\u2019 one-device-to-rule-them-all vision into reality. </p> \n <p> The title of the afternoon session is \u201cWhat to Build Next?\u201d and Fadell is onstage with two other bona fide tech zillionaires\u2014Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m, the Skype guy; and Kevin Ryan, one of New York City\u2019s most successful internet entrepreneurs\u2014as well as a couple of other founder-\u00adinvestor types. Of the five people onstage, Fadell is the only one who helped build an object that every person in the audience has most likely used at one time or another. First Fadell helped build the iPod for <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/apple\">Apple</a> , then the iPhone, and then he ventured out on his own to build the Nest thermostat. </p> \n <p>Fadell is the star of the show, and he knows it. His self-confidence is well earned but can come across as overweening\u2014especially to those who suddenly find themselves in his shadow. \u201cAny VC who tells you that you have to move to Silicon Valley,\u201d Fadell says at one point, gesticulating wildly, \u201cis being very lazy.\u201d Two of the other people onstage are, in fact, from Silicon Valley venture capital firms, and their collars seem to squeeze a bit tighter. Fadell, in comparison, is supremely comfortable: relaxed and expansive in a pair of bright red sneakers\u2014no socks\u2014and a polo shirt. The moderator, wrapping things up, calls for a lightning round: a rapid-fire series of questions\u2014with only one-word answers allowed.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <div> \n  <h4>Related Stories</h4> \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"/story/disruption-is-how-silicon-valley-eats-its-young/\"> \n     <div> \n      <div> \n       <div> \n        <div></div> \n       </div> \n      </div> \n     </div> \n     <div> \n      <p>\"Disruption\" Is How Silicon Valley Eats Its Young</p> \n     </div></a></li> \n   <li><a href=\"/2017/05/can-denver-become-like-silicon-valley/\"> \n     <div> \n      <div> \n       <div> \n        <div></div> \n       </div> \n      </div> \n     </div> \n     <div> \n      <p>Can the American Heartland Remake Itself in the Image of Silicon Valley?

Then he adds, \u201cWe\u2019regoingtohavetogonuclear \u2026\u201d before being hushed by the moderator for busting the one-word rule.</p> \n <p>What\u2019s the next big thing in tech?</p> \n <p>\u201cComputational synthetic biology,\u201d Fadell says, bending the rules a second time.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>What is the one word that people who know you would use to describe you?</p> \n <p>With that, the panel is over, and Fadell is mobbed as he tries to leave the Grove\u2019s 18th-century manor. People want autographs, selfies, a word or two\u2014but the most persistent want money and advice. Like many of his contemporaries, Fadell makes personal investments as an angel, through a firm called Future Shape, with one important difference: He says he has a venture-size pool of money\u2014a portfolio of Future Shape investments worth more than half a billion dollars. Looking to make his escape, Fadell slips into the men\u2019s room. One persistent supplicant follows and, while Fadell is standing at the urinal, penis in hand, proceeds to make his pitch. It\u2019s a startup with a new design for a robotic arm. Fadell listens for less than a minute and, shaking off, says: \u201cA new robot arm? China is going to copy that in a second! What then? What\u2019s your value proposition?\u201d</p> \n <p>Faster, better, cheaper \u2026 blah blah blah.</p> \n <p>\u201cNot good enough!\u201d Fadell thinks, before offering some bland words of encouragement and dashing off to slip into the back seat of a black Mercedes-Benz S-class emblazoned with the AMG performance badge. As we start to speed toward central London to catch the afternoon Eurostar to Paris, he entertains the chauffeur (and me) with the penis-pitch story. \u201cI did like his persistence, though,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cI respect that.\u201d</p> \n <p>Turning philosophical, Fadell puts on his shades against the bright sun streaming through the backseat sunroof. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like being a film producer,\u201d he says, reflecting on his new role, post-Nest, as an investor. People pitch him, and if he likes their idea, it\u2019s go time.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>As if on cue, Fadell is forced to cut his reverie short to take a call from a young journalist doing a story on \u201cthe new culture of celebrity in tech.\u201d</p> \n <p>Did you ever think that tech would make you into a celebrity?</p> \n <p> \u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Fadell says. \u201cThe tech business in the \u201980s was Revenge of the Nerds . It was geeks. We were looked down upon, trodden upon \u2026\u201d Fadell is working himself into his trademark lather. \u201c\u2009\u2018Who are these crazy guys with pocket protectors and broken glasses?\u2019\u2009\u201d he asks rhetorically. \u201cSo you never thought that you were going to become a rock star,\u201d Fadell says, winding down, before quickly amending the thought. \u201cNot that I am,\u201d he says, \u201cbut that\u2019s what some people think.\u201d </p> \n <p>I don\u2019t think Fadell is a rock star, but I\u2019m quickly realizing that he is not your run-of-the-mill Silicon Valley billionaire making an early retirement out of an investing hobby either. For starters, he doesn\u2019t even live in the Valley anymore. He has moved to Paris. Permanently. And the more I learn about him, the more I begin to suspect that Silicon Valley\u2019s favorite son secretly hates the Valley. To hear Fadell tell it, he certainly has reason to.</p>   \n <p>Rewind to the early \u201990s. Fadell, a computer engineering major at the University of Michigan, has already tasted entrepreneurial success with a little education-software company called Constructive Instruments that he founded in his dorm room, but he wants more. \u201cI was getting very frustrated being a big fish in a little pond in Ann Arbor,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cand my eyes were looking at the West going, Silicon Valley , Silicon Valley , Silicon Valley .\u201d For a technologist like Fadell, there was no other place. Then, when news broke that a handful of Apple alumni\u2014including the hero-programmer behind the Mac, Andy Hertzfeld\u2014had escaped the mothership and banded together to form a new company, General Magic, Fadell saw his future. </p> \n <p> Not long after graduating in 1991, he showed up at General Magic\u2019s offices in Mountain View, California, early one midweek morning, unannounced. And because he was there before the receptionist, he just started wandering the halls, uncomfortable in his jacket and tie, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in hand. He eventually found some people to pester\u2014people who had clearly been there all night, hacking away. Leave us alone , kid . \u201cI was humbled in the first 10 minutes of being there,\u201d he says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, this is not like Michigan, I have got to be here, these are the smartest people ever, I have got to be working here. I have to be working here.\u2019\u201d </p> \n <p>The young Fadell had persistence, and it paid off: By the end of 1991 he had a job offer from General Magic. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have said, back then, \u2018This guy\u2019s going to change the world,\u2019 particularly,\u201d Hertzfeld says. \u201cHe was incredibly talented, very opinionated, obviously very bright, and physically very strong.\u201d</p> \n <p>At General Magic, Fadell joined a small team that was trying to build something the company had labeled a personal communicator. \u201cIt had email. It had downloadable apps. It had shopping. It had animations and graphics and games. It had telecommunications\u2014a phone, a built-in modem,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cIt was the iPhone 14 years too soon.\u201d It never got off the ground, and Magic ran out of tricks and cash by the early 2000s, but the experience was formative. \u201cHardware, software, services. That was the first link that I ever saw like that,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cThat has influenced everything I\u2019ve done since.\u201d</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>A few years after leaving General Magic, Fadell had his own startup, Fuse Systems. It was a hardware company that was attempting to capitalize on the Napster-\u00adfueled rise of the MP3 music format. Yves B\u00e9har, the noted product designer, remembers working with the nascent company: The idea was to make a full line of MP3-optimized music players\u2014everything from a component stereo system to a small portable Walkman-type device. \u201cTony was talking about a world where media, especially music, was going to be all digital,\u201d B\u00e9har says. \u201cAnd he got so excited and animated and passionate that he broke a chair\u2014he was just very physical, getting up and sitting down again\u2014and that became a joke: Tony\u2019s a kind of excitable guy who breaks the furniture.\u201d</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>To get the idea off the ground, Fadell rented an office in San Francisco\u2019s Telegraph Hill neighborhood and hired about a dozen people. Then Apple called. This was just after Jobs had returned to the company he founded and was struggling to save it from oblivion. Jobs was looking for a way out of a no-win battle with Microsoft and, like Fadell, had hit upon the idea of a portable MP3 player. Toshiba had just announced the launch of a small-\u00adformat disk drive that would give the Apple MP3 player a crucial advantage over the competition. But Apple needed someone who knew the tech forward and backward to build out a prototype. Executives asked him to come in to discuss something\u2014they were cagey about exactly what.</p> \n <p>Fadell assumed Apple needed some help designing a next-gen Newton and took the meeting. It was only after he signed the nondisclosure agreements that he discovered that the company wanted him to design a portable MP3 player\u2014the future iPod. In effect, Apple was asking Fadell for help in competing with himself. Yet if Fuse were to have any chance of survival, Fadell had to take the consulting gig at Apple, because Fuse needed another infusion of cash. The traditional sources of funding had shut down because the dotcom crash was already under way.</p> \n <p>Fadell put Fuse on autopilot and designed the iPod prototype for Apple in six short weeks. After he demonstrated how the iPod could be built\u2014which components, which interfaces, and at what price\u2014Jobs put Fadell into a double bind. He asked him to abandon the Fuse MP3 player designs and develop his idea inside Apple, which would mean killing his own company. It was agonizing for the young entrepreneur. \u201cI was just like, whoa!\u201d says Fadell, who even now gets worked up at the thought. \u201cI am like, \u2018Wait a second, I have a company, and there are people over there working on this other thing. How am I going to do this?\u2019 So I just got in my car, and I started driving through the hills of Saratoga and Los Gatos. I go up to Skyline, I wind up those roads, and I\u2019m just sitting there going, \u2018What am I going to do? What am I doing?\u2019\u201d</p> \n <p>In the end, Fadell didn\u2019t have much of a choice. The odds of Fuse succeeding on its own were not good. So he put his own dreams in a box and went to work for Apple as the head of the iPod project. The first iPod was not perfect, but it was still way better than the competition\u2014and as it was refined, it grew into a monster hit. Steve Wozniak, who watched it all happen from the inside, credits the iPod with turning the entire company around. \u201cIt made our revenues double, our profits double, and our stock double,\u201d he says. The iPod was a hit, and Fadell was a hero inside Apple.</p> \n <p>When Jobs announced that he had cancer in 2004, Fadell was on every list of potential successors. He even reminded people of the mercurial Apple founder, both in his ability to get things done and in the way he operated. \u201cTony is a little bit like Steve Jobs in the way he shaded the truth,\u201d says Hertzfeld, who was close to both men. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly lying, but it\u2019s expressing things in an advantageous way.\u201d</p> \n <p>The iPhone, which came out in 2007, was Fadell\u2019s last chapter at Apple. As the guy who built the iPod, he had earned the right to shape the company\u2019s next flagship product. The phone project started in earnest at the end of 2004. By that time, Fadell and his team had prototyped iPods that could also make phone calls. Fadell\u2019s design used the iPod\u2019s circular controller like a rotary dial. But there was another team inside Apple with a bigger idea\u2014the all-touch screen. And the competition between the two teams at times escalated into full-on corporate warfare.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <div>  \n  <p>\u201cTony started to adopt Steve Jobs\u2019 mannerisms and persona because it was a pressure cooker\u2014but also you emulate what works, right? And so everyone started screaming at each other.\u201d</p>  \n </div> \n <p>Fadell lost the battle over the iPhone\u2019s final design\u2014but, because of his previous success, he was still expected to build the hardware, a power-sharing situation that created all kinds of drama with Scott Forstall, Apple\u2019s legendary software guru. \u201cThis is when Steve\u2019s leadership and management style started to permeate the company,\u201d remembers Andy Grignon, the manager responsible for the \u201cphone\u201d part of the iPhone. \u201cTony started to adopt Steve\u2019s mannerisms and persona because it was a pressure cooker\u2014but also you emulate what works, right? And so everyone started screaming at each other. It became just like the thing to do: Fly off the fucking handle.\u201d And by the time the iPhone was ready to launch, it seemed Fadell was no longer the golden boy.</p> \n <p> Jobs appeared to confirm this fact in an exceptionally cruel way: The message was signaled from the stage at the very event where the iPhone was unveiled, on January 9, 2007. When Jobs was demonstrating the iPhone\u2019s contact list, he showed that he could delete a contact with one tap\u2014and the contact he deleted was \u201c <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0wQ7oL9pIIU\">Tony Fadell</a> .\u201d The public may not have thought twice about the gesture, but the Apple engineers in the audience understood exactly what was going on. \u201cPeople laughed about it, but everybody knew,\u201d Grignon says. \u201cSteve was in many ways diabolical, and Tony and Steve\u2019s relationship had grown increasingly rocky.\u201d Fadell insists that his relationship with Jobs remained solid, but he seems to have been pretty decisively outmaneuvered. \u201cThat demo script,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cwas created by Scott Forstall.\u201d (A source closely involved with the presentation says Jobs was ad-libbing.) Fadell and his wife, Danielle Lambert, also an Apple employee, eventually decided they\u2019d had enough and were gone by November 2008. Fadell says they left to spend more time with their kids. \u201cSteve was wondering why we didn\u2019t do it sooner,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cAnd then for a year, year and a half, we kind of went around the world.\u201d The city they liked best was Paris, so there they settled. They bought a big, beautiful apartment in the seventh arrondissement, started filling it with contemporary art, and enrolled their eldest son in the local school. </p>        \n <p>Fadell is in full manic panic, and those are the first words out of his mouth as I step into his garden courtyard in the seventh. It\u2019s early in the morning, the day after Founders Forum in London, and I\u2019m being escorted onto the premises by Fadell\u2019s PR person. Today she has scheduled Fadell for a long sit-down interview with me. But all of that has been forgotten, as Fadell has just been hit with some disturbing news. \u201cFucking Apple,\u201d he says. Fadell clams up after this outburst, but I later hear there is a dispute brewing between one of the Future Shape companies and Apple.</p> \n <p>Fadell has invested in hundreds of startup companies, and I have no idea which of them is butting heads with Apple. However, I do glean enough to understand that there is nothing unusual about the morning\u2019s drama. Fadell is a drama king: The more drama, the better. In fact, Fadell\u2019s PR person is a specialist in what has come to be called crisis PR, and she tells me that with Fadell, \u201cevery day is a new adventure.\u201d</p> \n <p>Indeed, the next thing I hear from Fadell is that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to go now.\u201d He has decided that, instead of sitting down for the interview this morning, he has to make an appearance at VivaTech\u2014the TechCrunch of Europe. He points to a pair of bikes waiting in the courtyard, outfitted with a device that gives them an electric boost. The devices are from a startup called Superpedestrian, and Fadell is an investor. The bet on e-bikes is emblematic of the types of investments he\u2019s looking for. He tends to like hardware startups. He looks for industries that are very stable, where the basic designs, tools, or materials have barely changed for a long time. Consider Modern Meadow, a Future Shape portfolio company, which is trying to replace cow leather with a lab-grown substitute. Then there\u2019s a heating and cooling company aiming to replace every compressor in every industrial refrigerator in the world with a solid-state thermoelectric cooler\u2014a chip, in essence. In Fadell\u2019s mind, the ultimate triumph would be a breakthrough battery: \u201cIf we have energy storage technologies that are very cheap and very efficient, then we\u2019re going to see wars stop, because no one is going to be fighting over oil reserves anymore.\u201d</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>We each take a bike and head into traffic, riding south on Boulevard Saint-Germain and then merging into traffic to veer onto Boulevard Raspail. Fadell has our destination\u2014the Paris Expo center\u2014dialed into his iPhone. It\u2019s only 4 miles away, but we are going to have to sprint to get there in time. There\u2019s only one problem: \u201cMy boost doesn\u2019t work!\u201d Fadell says.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>No matter, he just stands up on his pedals and grinds like a bike messenger who has just guzzled a gallon of espresso. Keeping up is not easy, even with my Superpedestrian-assisted superlegs, because Fadell is blowing through red lights, splitting lanes, squeezing through wormholes in moving traffic. And doing it all one-handed so he can keep an eye on the map.</p> \n <p>\u201cWatch out for cops, OK?\u201d he says as we blast through another busy intersection. \u201cIf they see me riding with my phone out, it\u2019s an automatic ticket.\u201d</p> \n <p>We\u2019re cranking, running with traffic on the Rue de Rennes, and then the second technical fail strikes.</p> \n <p>\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d Fadell grunts, glaring at his screen while spinning his crankset madly. \u201cMy phone is only at 50 percent charge. It was full when we left this morning.\u201d</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>\u201cYou need to be able to jack it into that battery in the bike,\u201d I say, offering an unsolicited design critique.</p> \n <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201d he says, leaning into a chicane designed to slow traffic.</p> \n <p>A left, a right. The streets are getting wider: four lanes, then six. Traffic is moving faster and faster. Fadell is starting to sweat.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>\u201cI need to reboot. There\u2019s a bug in the phone. It\u2019s sucking power,\u201d he says. We glide to a stop at the edge of a deserted plaza near a train station so Fadell can reboot his iPhone. The reboot doesn\u2019t fix the bug. \u201cSuch is the life of a digital citizen,\u201d he sighs.</p> \n <p>I have an idea: I hand him my Android so he can continue to navigate, and we are off again. It\u2019s all downhill from here, and soon we are on a paved bike path. Fadell narrowly escapes a head-on collision with a helmeted mountain biker while trying to get his bearings from the unfamiliar phone.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>We\u2019ve got gravity at our back, trees to our left, and pedestrians to our right. We\u2019re laying down a groove in a dedicated bike lane carved out of an impossibly wide Parisian sidewalk.</p> \n <p>\u201cIt says we\u2019re here! Do you see it? It\u2019s just to our left somewhere,\u201d Fadell says, craning his neck, looking for the Expo center.</p> \n <p>Fadell\u2019s front wheel goes kerflooey against a half-inch granite curb delineating the edge of the bike lane, and he\u2019s thrown to the ground. The bicyclist behind us swerves to avoid the crash and curses at Fadell while he\u2019s down, splayed over his crumpled bike: \u201cMerde!\u201d</p> \n <p>My phone is yards away, having escaped Fadell\u2019s grip when he went flying. The screen is shattered. Fadell has dirt stains on the knees of his white jeans.</p> \n <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to put this in the story, are you?\u201d Fadell asks.</p>    \n <div></div>  \n <div> \n  <p>Fadell never misses a chance to pooh-pooh the Valley. He made a fortune in Silicon Valley and now has left it for good. He\u2019s putting down roots in Paris.</p> \n </div> \n <div> Nadav Kander \n </div>   \n <p>The one problem with moving to Paris was that Fadell had no real network there. Then he met Xavier Niel\u2014a man sometimes referred to as \u201cthe French Steve Jobs.\u201d He made his money as an internet entrepreneur and now, like Fadell, invests it. \u201cI was reading blogs and stuff, but I wanted to talk to other people in the business,\u201d Fadell tells me. </p> \n <p>\u201cAt the time, Paris wasn\u2019t a big tech city,\u201d says Niel, who recalls meeting Fadell early one afternoon in his office in 2009. It was a blind date bromance, and they talked for almost 10 hours straight. \u201cOh my God, we just bonded instantly,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cWe had similar backgrounds, just in different countries. He had an Apple II, I had an Apple II.\u201d</p> \n <p>\u201cWe spoke a lot about electronics \u2026\u201d Niel says.</p> \n <p>Fadell had an idea about a company of his own and was looking for collaborators. \u201cNest was burning inside me to be created,\u201d he says. Niel was an early investor.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>The Nest elevator pitch: home thermostat meets the iPhone. Nest was never simply about making a smarter, more beautiful thermostat, any more than the iPhone was about making a smarter, more beautiful phone. The business pitch was that, someday soon, every device in the average house\u2014every lock, appliance, power outlet, and light switch\u2014would be replaced by a fancy cloud-\u00adconnected gizmo. And what would connect this so-called internet of things? Who would provide the operating system to the houses and apartments we would all be living in? Well, Nest of course.</p> \n <p>Fadell moved back to Silicon Valley to build it with Matt Rogers, who had been Fadell\u2019s colleague at Apple. The company was incorporated in June 2010 and was in stealth mode for more than a year. Google\u2019s Sergey Brin saw a prototype early in 2011 and immediately moved to buy the company. Fadell said no. Steve Jobs heard about the thermostat and wanted to see it too, but by the time Fadell felt it was perfect enough to show to the perfectionist, Jobs was on his deathbed. He never saw it.</p> \n <p>The Nest thermostat debuted at the end of 2011 and earned Nest a raft of plaudits and design awards, and all the attention was making Fadell nervous. \u201cI have seen this before,\u201d he says, \u201cwhere you\u2019re the biggest fish in the smaller pond, and then all of a sudden the pond grows immensely because Google or Microsoft or Apple or Amazon or Samsung gets into it, and now you\u2019re a very tiny fish with these big, big, big whales.\u201d</p> \n <p>By the summer of 2013, the second product in the Nest family, a smart smoke detector, was about to come out, and Fadell was looking to raise more money through an investment round. \u201cWe had connected products, but what we wanted to do was connect the whole thing together. That was the vision of Nest. So how much money was it going to take?\u201d Fadell asks. The answer: a ton of money\u2014and time too. Meanwhile, Google was still interested in buying the company outright. Nest was starting to look like the key that could unlock a gazillion-dollar \u201cconnected home\u201d market, and acquiring Fadell seemed to be a chance to inject Google with some of the design DNA that had made Apple the most valuable company in the world.</p> \n <p>Fadell was pressed hard against the same dilemma he\u2019d faced at Fuse a decade earlier. He could bet everything on himself and risk losing\u2014or he could try to pursue his vision inside the confines of a warm corporate cocoon. This time the double bind wasn\u2019t so heartbreaking. Fadell wouldn\u2019t have to kill his company, because Nest would effectively live inside Google. Fadell could keep control while drawing on all the Google infrastructure he needed to build Nest into a connected-home platform. \u201cAll kinds of promises were made,\u201d Fadell says. Including, according to a source who saw the contract, a five-year \u201crunway\u201d\u2014a period of time in which Nest could spend and innovate freely with the goal of capturing the entire connected-\u00adhome ecosystem that everyone knew was coming.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p> In January 2014, Google acquired Nest for $3.2 billion. Five months later, Google bought Dropcam, a smart home-security-camera company. The plan was to do some modifications, rebrand the system, and add the \u201cnew\u201d Nest Cam into Fadell\u2019s product line. That\u2019s what happened, but not before the former Dropcam CEO, Greg Duffy, attempted a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat early in 2015. According to an article on the news site The Information , Duffy sent an email to Google CEO Larry Page complaining about Fadell, his boss at Nest. He also recommended that Fadell be fired and suggested that he himself should replace Fadell. When Duffy\u2019s insubordinate power play got no response from Page, he quit Nest and, for good measure, says he told Fadell, \u201cI think you\u2019re running this company like a tyrant bureaucrat!\u201d before walking out. </p> \n <p>There\u2019s definitely a tyrannical streak in Fadell\u2014in a heated moment Fadell once asked his cofounder, Rogers, to postpone his honeymoon to help the Nest team meet some deadlines. (Rogers knew the storm would pass and took his honeymoon as scheduled.) But Fadell\u2019s real problem wasn\u2019t his so-called tyranny\u2014it was the new bureaucracy he suddenly found himself in.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>The month after Duffy transferred out of Nest, becoming an \u201centrepreneur in residence\u201d deep inside the Google death star, Ruth Porat was hired as Google\u2019s new CFO. Porat had deep roots in Silicon Valley\u2014her brother, Marc, was Fadell\u2019s boss at General Magic\u2014but Porat came from Wall Street.</p> \n <p> She was hired to bring financial discipline to Google. And indeed, within five months, Google announced that it was no longer \u201cGoogle\u201d anymore. It was <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/04/googles-alphabet-transition-tougher-b-c/\">Alphabet</a> , a holding company that would contain at least a dozen divisions. There would be the core search-and-\u00adadvertising company called \u201cGoogle\u201d as well as what Alphabet called its \u201cother bets.\u201d Nest was one of the other bets, and as a division Nest would have to meet certain revenue goals, and its balance sheet would suddenly be subject to large overhead and other indirect charges from Alphabet. </p> \n <p>Fadell remembers the moment vividly. He thought he had a promise: five years in which to build Nest into the dominant connected-\u00adhome platform. But everything changed when Google morphed into Alphabet. \u201cThey decided there was a new regime in town, and they said, \u2018We\u2019re going to have all new metrics,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018This is not what we agreed to before,\u2019 because this was not just about fiscal things\u2014it was about getting married. I had never thought about being bought. It was about getting married to build a beautiful child, right?\u201d</p> \n <p>Fadell soldiered on under the new regime for four months, until at the end of 2015 he discovered that the new bottom-line-oriented Alphabet was going to sell Nest. \u201cAt that point I knew it wasn\u2019t going to work out, and that\u2019s when I came home to my wife, after a lot of struggles with the Alphabet thing. It wasn\u2019t working, it was, OK, it\u2019s over.\u201d</p> \n <p> Things went south after Fadell told Page that he wanted out in December of 2015. The tech blogs started circling, and the famously tight-lipped Google started leaking. Recode got ahold of a meme, created by someone inside the company, that showed a cartoon mob, torches raised high, behind the words \u201csell nest.\u201d The Information  did a damning expos\u00e9, featuring Duffy\u2019s version of Nest as a bloated, ineffectual organization. In a follow-up blog post, Duffy accused Nest\u2019s leadership of \u201cfetishizing only the most superfluous and negative traits of their mentors\u201d\u2014in other words, Fadell had emulated Steve Jobs\u2019 dark side but not his capacity for getting things done. Fadell, of course, rejected the charges: In his view, Duffy was acting out of line, while Nest was racking up accomplishments at Google\u2014a regular drumbeat of significant hardware redesigns and new software services. Fadell felt blindsided by Duffy and hamstrung by legal agreements restricting what he could say publicly: \u201cI was disappointed Google did not step up to the line when these personal attacks were made on me and Nest,\u201d he says. Furthermore, Google threatened Fadell with legal action if Fadell went ahead and defended himself in the press\u2014this tidbit according to the same source who saw the five-year runway clause in the original purchase agreement between Google and Nest. Alphabet, which politely declined to comment on what exactly went wrong at Nest, whether Fadell quit or was fired, or even if there was any runway agreement in the first place, vehemently denies threatening Fadell with legal action. Whatever really happened behind closed doors, we do know for certain that by June 2016, Fadell had returned to Paris for good. </p>    \n <div></div>  \n <div> \n  <p>\u201cAny VC who tells you that you have to move to Silicon Valley,\u201d Fadell says, gesticulating wildly, \u201cis being very lazy.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <div> Nadav Kander \n </div>   \n <p>Given that Fadell has tangled with major Silicon Valley companies and lost twice, it\u2019s hardly surprising that he decided to relocate to Paris. The surprising thing is that he may have found something better. At least that\u2019s the case Xavier Niel makes. Silicon Valley, Niel says, is for suckers. He ticks off the downsides: the sky-high salaries needed to attract engineers, the atrocious traffic, the relative dearth of cultural institutions, the isolation from the great cities of Europe \u2026 </p> \n <p>I am, to say the least, dubious: France is known for being unfavorable ground for businesses of all kinds\u2014especially startups. It has high taxes, rigid labor laws, and a culture that is averse to the free market. But I have to concede that Niel, a billionaire eight times over, is putting his money where his mouth is. He\u2019s making the case against Silicon Valley in the middle of Station F, a massive complex on the outskirts of Paris devoted exclusively to the care and feeding of startups. The building that houses it all is a former railroad terminal almost as long as the Eiffel Tower is tall and filled with a sea of desks\u2014more than 3,000 in all. Basically, it\u2019s a gargantuan coworking space, one that comes with all the amenities you\u2019d find in a big Silicon Valley company campus\u2014foosball tables, private conference rooms, fancy food courts, a chill zone, beanbag chairs. All of it is owned and operated by Niel.</p> \n <p>He operates as its landlord. Young entrepreneurs with an idea have to apply to get in, and if they do, they pay a nominal fee for a desk and plug-and-play access to the entire French entrepreneurial ecosystem. Looking down from all sides are offices of the permanent tenants: angel networks, VC firms, incubator and accelerator programs, outposts of large firms like Facebook and Microsoft looking to hire and acquire. Those tenants pay top dollar for the advantage of being in the same building with all the young guns.</p> \n <p>One of the nicest of the permanent offices belongs to Fadell. Future Shape, his fund, is now worth, he estimates, between $500 million and $1 billion. That\u2019s equivalent to a medium- or even large-size venture fund. But the difference is that, unlike a VC fund, Fadell doesn\u2019t have a bunch of limited partners backing him, tracking returns over (typically) a 10-year maturation period. Future Shape is all Fadell\u2019s money, so there\u2019s none of the usual VC pressure to IPO or be acquired. His personal balance sheet is not public, but financial lightning struck him twice: Both he and his wife got a bundle of Apple stock options back when AAPL was dirt cheap, and then he sold Nest to Google for $3.2 billion. \u201cIt\u2019s all covered,\u201d Fadell says, referring to his finances. \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d So the point of Future Shape, for Fadell, is finding those magic products\u2014like the iPhone or the Nest thermostat\u2014that need long runways but might change everything.</p> \n <p>\u201cAll of these incumbents with these big businesses that have been around for 100 or 200 years can be unseated,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cbecause technology is the unseating element, the levelizer.\u201d When Fadell talks about \u201ctechnology\u201d he means something a bit different than the usual definition. He waves off things like email and spreadsheets as mere bolt-ons to existing business models. His thesis is that almost every industry is up for grabs when and if someone like him redesigns the essential hardware with software and services baked in. It\u2019s the formula Fadell learned at General Magic and then applied at Apple and Nest. Everywhere he looks, he sees industries ripe for his particular brand of disruption: logistics and trucking, urban transportation, farming.</p> \n <p>It\u2019s an exceedingly familiar rap. Every venture fund claims that disruptive opportunity is everywhere\u2014it\u2019s the very premise of that type of investing\u2014and lots of them claim, for one reason or another, that they don\u2019t push their startups for exits.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <div>  \n  <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re launching a startup today, don\u2019t go to Silicon Valley if you\u2019re not from there,\u201d Fadell tells a group of students. \u201cDon\u2019t do it!\u201d</p>  \n </div> \n <p>Fadell indulges in one heresy, however: an insistence that you no longer need to throw yourself at the feet of the Silicon Valley masters, as he did 25 years ago. \u201cIf you\u2019re launching a startup today, don\u2019t go to Silicon Valley if you\u2019re not from there,\u201d Fadell tells a group of awestruck students at a coding school that feeds its graduates into Station F. \u201cDon\u2019t do it! You\u2019re at an incredible disadvantage.\u201d It is clear that he\u2019s also talking about himself.</p> \n <p> In fact, whatever the audience, whether it\u2019s coding kids or the founders of Founders Forum, Fadell never misses a chance to pooh-pooh the Valley. Fadell made a fortune in Silicon Valley and now has left it for good. He\u2019s putting down roots in Paris. He studies with a French tutor every day and is getting fluent. His two kids are enrolled in the local \u00e9cole , and the headquarters of Future Shape\u2014the new business\u2014are inside Station F. </p> \n <p> You don\u2019t need Freud to figure out why. Look past the big wallet and the big ego and you see a guy who has been grievously hurt by the Silicon Valley system\u2014exploited and then betrayed, twice. First by Steve Jobs, who squeezed Fadell for all the juice he had and then publicly tossed him aside. The second time it was the same shit, different company\u2014Fadell was again sucker-punched on the way out. The wave of bad publicity while he was at Nest\u2014the Recode memes, the Information  expos\u00e9\u2014came after Fadell told Page he wanted to leave Google. </p> \n <p>Sure, he might have failed altogether if it hadn\u2019t been for the support of Apple and Alphabet. And by one very important measure, Fadell succeeded stupendously, thanks to Silicon Valley: He walked away from both companies with huge piles of money. Maybe for mere mortals, money would be enough. But it wasn\u2019t for Jobs, who famously plotted and finally succeeded in winning back the control that Apple\u2019s early financiers took from him. Hardware is tough: Putting millions of things in the hands of millions of people requires large amounts of capital. And when someone gives you large amounts of capital, it often means you lose control. Elon Musk, who is two years younger than Fadell, is the first Silicon Valley hardware titan in generations to retain control of his inventions. Fadell seems to yearn to oversee his own dominion. This idea that he had to sell his babies is, I sense, what drives him.</p> \n <p>Fadell is almost pathologically compelled to say what\u2019s on his mind, and never in the week I spent shadowing him did he say anything that smacked of self-pity. But by the end of the week, it was clear what this third act of his career is about. He\u2019s trying to challenge a Silicon Valley\u00adcentric system that separated him from his creations.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <div>  \n  <p>In Paris, he can pick out younger versions of himself, give them money and watch all the possible versions of his life story unfold again and again.</p>  \n </div> \n <p>In France, Fadell has a mini-\u00adreplica of Silicon Valley outside the Future Shape door. It\u2019s a place where he can pick out younger versions of himself, give them money, and\u2014in a sense\u2014watch all the possible versions of his own life story unfold again and again. \u201cMy job is to come here and bring Silicon Valley here,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s that cultural element that people are trying to replicate around the world, of taking risks and believing in yourself and changing the world, and there\u2019s no reason it can only be done in Silicon Valley.\u201d Fadell is the vector, the human tissue culture in a grand cloning experiment\u2014as well as the experimenter, tweaking the rules.</p> \n <p>What I see is a guy trying to prove to Silicon Valley that his way was the right way all along\u2014with the irony that he\u2019s trying to make that case in a high-tax country that has, so far, produced very few high tech companies of note. But who knows? It might just work. Station F is not some government-\u00adhatched \u201cdevelopment\u201d plan but rather the private gamble of a self-made tech billionaire, and Niel\u2019s stated goal is to have it pump out a thousand additional startups a year into what is one of Europe\u2019s biggest startup cities. \u201cIt\u2019s the ambition of all the people here, including Tony, as well as our new president Macron\u201d\u2014the young French president has met with both Fadell and Niel\u2014\u201cto help this ecosystem become huge.\u201d</p> \n <p>As for Fadell\u2019s Future Shape, it already includes chunks of some of the more promising non\u2013Silicon Valley companies going\u2014Superpedestrian in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Modern Meadow in Nutley, New Jersey; Convargo in Paris; DICE in London; CashShield in Singapore\u2014and to a person their CEOs have described Fadell\u2019s behind-the-scenes help as invaluable. Judging by the idolization that Fadell gets from young French coders, Future Shape will undoubtedly get early access to the startups that will emerge from Station F and elsewhere. His rock-star status is probably his main advantage as an investor. Will it be enough to beat Valley VCs at their own game? We\u2019ll see.</p> \n <p>But in another sense, Fadell\u2019s big bet on Paris has already paid off. Spiritually, he\u2019s back home\u2014to that Midwestern place where he was before he was sucked into Silicon Valley\u2019s vortex. He calls his own shots. He\u2019s a big fish in a small pond. He\u2019s in control. And this time around, Silicon Valley comes to him. \u201cTony meets more American tech people in Paris than in the US,\u201d Niel says. \u201cBecause if you are a big US tech manager, you come to Paris at least one or two times a year\u2014and when they do, they all call Tony!\u201d</p> \n <p>By all means, when you come to Paris, you should definitely look Fadell up. He\u2019s a wild man, a maverick, a bull in a china shop, and a lot of fun. But take one bit of advice from me: Whatever you do, don\u2019t let him borrow your phone.</p>  \n</div>",
        "text": "Tony Fadell isat the Grove, a spectacularly beautiful country estate outside of London. The event is Founders Forum: the ultra \u00adexclusive invite-only tech conference. Prince William is in the house. The guest list is lousy with knights and lesser officers of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. Marissa Mayer, the now ex-CEO of Yahoo, and Biz Stone, recently returned to Twitter, are mingling with the other hundred or so invitees. But this is really Fadell\u2019s moment. It\u2019s almost exactly 10 years since the iPhone was released, and the media buzz is inescapable. The press is having trouble coming up with superlatives to describe the impact of a device that has sold more than a billion units. A new book, The One Device, is lighting up the intertubes with fresh gossip about \u201cthe secret history of the iPhone.\u201d And Fadell\u2014both the source and the subject of that gossip\u2014is getting his due as one of the guys most responsible for turning Steve Jobs\u2019 one-device-to-rule-them-all vision into reality. The title of the afternoon session is \u201cWhat to Build Next?\u201d and Fadell is onstage with two other bona fide tech zillionaires\u2014Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m, the Skype guy; and Kevin Ryan, one of New York City\u2019s most successful internet entrepreneurs\u2014as well as a couple of other founder-\u00adinvestor types. Of the five people onstage, Fadell is the only one who helped build an object that every person in the audience has most likely used at one time or another. First Fadell helped build the iPod for Apple, then the iPhone, and then he ventured out on his own to build the Nest thermostat. Fadell is the star of the show, and he knows it. His self-confidence is well earned but can come across as overweening\u2014especially to those who suddenly find themselves in his shadow. \u201cAny VC who tells you that you have to move to Silicon Valley,\u201d Fadell says at one point, gesticulating wildly, \u201cis being very lazy.\u201d Two of the other people onstage are, in fact, from Silicon Valley venture capital firms, and their collars seem to squeeze a bit tighter. Fadell, in comparison, is supremely comfortable: relaxed and expansive in a pair of bright red sneakers\u2014no socks\u2014and a polo shirt. The moderator, wrapping things up, calls for a lightning round: a rapid-fire series of questions\u2014with only one-word answers allowed. Related Stories \"Disruption\" Is How Silicon Valley Eats Its Young Can the American Heartland Remake Itself in the Image of Silicon Valley? One Startup Finds Out How Silicon Valley Utopianism Brought You the Dystopian Trump Presidency What\u2019s the biggest problem facing the world right now? \u201cClimate,\u201d Fadell says. Then he adds, \u201cWe\u2019regoingtohavetogonuclear \u2026\u201d before being hushed by the moderator for busting the one-word rule. What\u2019s the next big thing in tech? \u201cComputational synthetic biology,\u201d Fadell says, bending the rules a second time. What is the one word that people who know you would use to describe you? With that, the panel is over, and Fadell is mobbed as he tries to leave the Grove\u2019s 18th-century manor. People want autographs, selfies, a word or two\u2014but the most persistent want money and advice. Like many of his contemporaries, Fadell makes personal investments as an angel, through a firm called Future Shape, with one important difference: He says he has a venture-size pool of money\u2014a portfolio of Future Shape investments worth more than half a billion dollars. Looking to make his escape, Fadell slips into the men\u2019s room. One persistent supplicant follows and, while Fadell is standing at the urinal, penis in hand, proceeds to make his pitch. It\u2019s a startup with a new design for a robotic arm. Fadell listens for less than a minute and, shaking off, says: \u201cA new robot arm? China is going to copy that in a second! What then? What\u2019s your value proposition?\u201d Faster, better, cheaper \u2026 blah blah blah. \u201cNot good enough!\u201d Fadell thinks, before offering some bland words of encouragement and dashing off to slip into the back seat of a black Mercedes-Benz S-class emblazoned with the AMG performance badge. As we start to speed toward central London to catch the afternoon Eurostar to Paris, he entertains the chauffeur (and me) with the penis-pitch story. \u201cI did like his persistence, though,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cI respect that.\u201d Turning philosophical, Fadell puts on his shades against the bright sun streaming through the backseat sunroof. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like being a film producer,\u201d he says, reflecting on his new role, post-Nest, as an investor. People pitch him, and if he likes their idea, it\u2019s go time. As if on cue, Fadell is forced to cut his reverie short to take a call from a young journalist doing a story on \u201cthe new culture of celebrity in tech.\u201d Did you ever think that tech would make you into a celebrity? \u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Fadell says. \u201cThe tech business in the \u201980s was Revenge of the Nerds. It was geeks. We were looked down upon, trodden upon \u2026\u201d Fadell is working himself into his trademark lather. \u201c\u2009\u2018Who are these crazy guys with pocket protectors and broken glasses?\u2019\u2009\u201d he asks rhetorically. \u201cSo you never thought that you were going to become a rock star,\u201d Fadell says, winding down, before quickly amending the thought. \u201cNot that I am,\u201d he says, \u201cbut that\u2019s what some people think.\u201d I don\u2019t think Fadell is a rock star, but I\u2019m quickly realizing that he is not your run-of-the-mill Silicon Valley billionaire making an early retirement out of an investing hobby either. For starters, he doesn\u2019t even live in the Valley anymore. He has moved to Paris. Permanently. And the more I learn about him, the more I begin to suspect that Silicon Valley\u2019s favorite son secretly hates the Valley. To hear Fadell tell it, he certainly has reason to. Rewind to theearly \u201990s. Fadell, a computer engineering major at the University of Michigan, has already tasted entrepreneurial success with a little education-software company called Constructive Instruments that he founded in his dorm room, but he wants more. \u201cI was getting very frustrated being a big fish in a little pond in Ann Arbor,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cand my eyes were looking at the West going, Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley.\u201d For a technologist like Fadell, there was no other place. Then, when news broke that a handful of Apple alumni\u2014including the hero-programmer behind the Mac, Andy Hertzfeld\u2014had escaped the mothership and banded together to form a new company, General Magic, Fadell saw his future. Not long after graduating in 1991, he showed up at General Magic\u2019s offices in Mountain View, California, early one midweek morning, unannounced. And because he was there before the receptionist, he just started wandering the halls, uncomfortable in his jacket and tie, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in hand. He eventually found some people to pester\u2014people who had clearly been there all night, hacking away. Leave us alone, kid. \u201cI was humbled in the first 10 minutes of being there,\u201d he says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, this is not like Michigan, I have got to be here, these are the smartest people ever, I have got to be working here. I have to be working here.\u2019\u201d The young Fadell had persistence, and it paid off: By the end of 1991 he had a job offer from General Magic. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have said, back then, \u2018This guy\u2019s going to change the world,\u2019 particularly,\u201d Hertzfeld says. \u201cHe was incredibly talented, very opinionated, obviously very bright, and physically very strong.\u201d At General Magic, Fadell joined a small team that was trying to build something the company had labeled a personal communicator. \u201cIt had email. It had downloadable apps. It had shopping. It had animations and graphics and games. It had telecommunications\u2014a phone, a built-in modem,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cIt was the iPhone 14 years too soon.\u201d It never got off the ground, and Magic ran out of tricks and cash by the early 2000s, but the experience was formative. \u201cHardware, software, services. That was the first link that I ever saw like that,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cThat has influenced everything I\u2019ve done since.\u201d A few years after leaving General Magic, Fadell had his own startup, Fuse Systems. It was a hardware company that was attempting to capitalize on the Napster-\u00adfueled rise of the MP3 music format. Yves B\u00e9har, the noted product designer, remembers working with the nascent company: The idea was to make a full line of MP3-optimized music players\u2014everything from a component stereo system to a small portable Walkman-type device. \u201cTony was talking about a world where media, especially music, was going to be all digital,\u201d B\u00e9har says. \u201cAnd he got so excited and animated and passionate that he broke a chair\u2014he was just very physical, getting up and sitting down again\u2014and that became a joke: Tony\u2019s a kind of excitable guy who breaks the furniture.\u201d To get the idea off the ground, Fadell rented an office in San Francisco\u2019s Telegraph Hill neighborhood and hired about a dozen people. Then Apple called. This was just after Jobs had returned to the company he founded and was struggling to save it from oblivion. Jobs was looking for a way out of a no-win battle with Microsoft and, like Fadell, had hit upon the idea of a portable MP3 player. Toshiba had just announced the launch of a small-\u00adformat disk drive that would give the Apple MP3 player a crucial advantage over the competition. But Apple needed someone who knew the tech forward and backward to build out a prototype. Executives asked him to come in to discuss something\u2014they were cagey about exactly what. Fadell assumed Apple needed some help designing a next-gen Newton and took the meeting. It was only after he signed the nondisclosure agreements that he discovered that the company wanted him to design a portable MP3 player\u2014the future iPod. In effect, Apple was asking Fadell for help in competing with himself. Yet if Fuse were to have any chance of survival, Fadell had to take the consulting gig at Apple, because Fuse needed another infusion of cash. The traditional sources of funding had shut down because the dotcom crash was already under way. Fadell put Fuse on autopilot and designed the iPod prototype for Apple in six short weeks. After he demonstrated how the iPod could be built\u2014which components, which interfaces, and at what price\u2014Jobs put Fadell into a double bind. He asked him to abandon the Fuse MP3 player designs and develop his idea inside Apple, which would mean killing his own company. It was agonizing for the young entrepreneur. \u201cI was just like, whoa!\u201d says Fadell, who even now gets worked up at the thought. \u201cI am like, \u2018Wait a second, I have a company, and there are people over there working on this other thing. How am I going to do this?\u2019 So I just got in my car, and I started driving through the hills of Saratoga and Los Gatos. I go up to Skyline, I wind up those roads, and I\u2019m just sitting there going, \u2018What am I going to do? What am I doing?\u2019\u201d In the end, Fadell didn\u2019t have much of a choice. The odds of Fuse succeeding on its own were not good. So he put his own dreams in a box and went to work for Apple as the head of the iPod project. The first iPod was not perfect, but it was still way better than the competition\u2014and as it was refined, it grew into a monster hit. Steve Wozniak, who watched it all happen from the inside, credits the iPod with turning the entire company around. \u201cIt made our revenues double, our profits double, and our stock double,\u201d he says. The iPod was a hit, and Fadell was a hero inside Apple. When Jobs announced that he had cancer in 2004, Fadell was on every list of potential successors. He even reminded people of the mercurial Apple founder, both in his ability to get things done and in the way he operated. \u201cTony is a little bit like Steve Jobs in the way he shaded the truth,\u201d says Hertzfeld, who was close to both men. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly lying, but it\u2019s expressing things in an advantageous way.\u201d The iPhone, which came out in 2007, was Fadell\u2019s last chapter at Apple. As the guy who built the iPod, he had earned the right to shape the company\u2019s next flagship product. The phone project started in earnest at the end of 2004. By that time, Fadell and his team had prototyped iPods that could also make phone calls. Fadell\u2019s design used the iPod\u2019s circular controller like a rotary dial. But there was another team inside Apple with a bigger idea\u2014the all-touch screen. And the competition between the two teams at times escalated into full-on corporate warfare. \u201cTony started to adopt Steve Jobs\u2019 mannerisms and persona because it was a pressure cooker\u2014but also you emulate what works, right? And so everyone started screaming at each other.\u201d Fadell lost the battle over the iPhone\u2019s final design\u2014but, because of his previous success, he was still expected to build the hardware, a power-sharing situation that created all kinds of drama with Scott Forstall, Apple\u2019s legendary software guru. \u201cThis is when Steve\u2019s leadership and management style started to permeate the company,\u201d remembers Andy Grignon, the manager responsible for the \u201cphone\u201d part of the iPhone. \u201cTony started to adopt Steve\u2019s mannerisms and persona because it was a pressure cooker\u2014but also you emulate what works, right? And so everyone started screaming at each other. It became just like the thing to do: Fly off the fucking handle.\u201d And by the time the iPhone was ready to launch, it seemed Fadell was no longer the golden boy. Jobs appeared to confirm this fact in an exceptionally cruel way: The message was signaled from the stage at the very event where the iPhone was unveiled, on January 9, 2007. When Jobs was demonstrating the iPhone\u2019s contact list, he showed that he could delete a contact with one tap\u2014and the contact he deleted was \u201cTony Fadell.\u201d The public may not have thought twice about the gesture, but the Apple engineers in the audience understood exactly what was going on. \u201cPeople laughed about it, but everybody knew,\u201d Grignon says. \u201cSteve was in many ways diabolical, and Tony and Steve\u2019s relationship had grown increasingly rocky.\u201d Fadell insists that his relationship with Jobs remained solid, but he seems to have been pretty decisively outmaneuvered. \u201cThat demo script,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cwas created by Scott Forstall.\u201d (A source closely involved with the presentation says Jobs was ad-libbing.) Fadell and his wife, Danielle Lambert, also an Apple employee, eventually decided they\u2019d had enough and were gone by November 2008. Fadell says they left to spend more time with their kids. \u201cSteve was wondering why we didn\u2019t do it sooner,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cAnd then for a year, year and a half, we kind of went around the world.\u201d The city they liked best was Paris, so there they settled. They bought a big, beautiful apartment in the seventh arrondissement, started filling it with contemporary art, and enrolled their eldest son in the local school. Fadell is in full manic panic, and those are the first words out of his mouth as I step into his garden courtyard in the seventh. It\u2019s early in the morning, the day after Founders Forum in London, and I\u2019m being escorted onto the premises by Fadell\u2019s PR person. Today she has scheduled Fadell for a long sit-down interview with me. But all of that has been forgotten, as Fadell has just been hit with some disturbing news. \u201cFucking Apple,\u201d he says. Fadell clams up after this outburst, but I later hear there is a dispute brewing between one of the Future Shape companies and Apple. Fadell has invested in hundreds of startup companies, and I have no idea which of them is butting heads with Apple. However, I do glean enough to understand that there is nothing unusual about the morning\u2019s drama. Fadell is a drama king: The more drama, the better. In fact, Fadell\u2019s PR person is a specialist in what has come to be called crisis PR, and she tells me that with Fadell, \u201cevery day is a new adventure.\u201d Indeed, the next thing I hear from Fadell is that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to go now.\u201d He has decided that, instead of sitting down for the interview this morning, he has to make an appearance at VivaTech\u2014the TechCrunch of Europe. He points to a pair of bikes waiting in the courtyard, outfitted with a device that gives them an electric boost. The devices are from a startup called Superpedestrian, and Fadell is an investor. The bet on e-bikes is emblematic of the types of investments he\u2019s looking for. He tends to like hardware startups. He looks for industries that are very stable, where the basic designs, tools, or materials have barely changed for a long time. Consider Modern Meadow, a Future Shape portfolio company, which is trying to replace cow leather with a lab-grown substitute. Then there\u2019s a heating and cooling company aiming to replace every compressor in every industrial refrigerator in the world with a solid-state thermoelectric cooler\u2014a chip, in essence. In Fadell\u2019s mind, the ultimate triumph would be a breakthrough battery: \u201cIf we have energy storage technologies that are very cheap and very efficient, then we\u2019re going to see wars stop, because no one is going to be fighting over oil reserves anymore.\u201d We each take a bike and head into traffic, riding south on Boulevard Saint-Germain and then merging into traffic to veer onto Boulevard Raspail. Fadell has our destination\u2014the Paris Expo center\u2014dialed into his iPhone. It\u2019s only 4 miles away, but we are going to have to sprint to get there in time. There\u2019s only one problem: \u201cMy boost doesn\u2019t work!\u201d Fadell says. No matter, he just stands up on his pedals and grinds like a bike messenger who has just guzzled a gallon of espresso. Keeping up is not easy, even with my Superpedestrian-assisted superlegs, because Fadell is blowing through red lights, splitting lanes, squeezing through wormholes in moving traffic. And doing it all one-handed so he can keep an eye on the map. \u201cWatch out for cops, OK?\u201d he says as we blast through another busy intersection. \u201cIf they see me riding with my phone out, it\u2019s an automatic ticket.\u201d We\u2019re cranking, running with traffic on the Rue de Rennes, and then the second technical fail strikes. \u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d Fadell grunts, glaring at his screen while spinning his crankset madly. \u201cMy phone is only at 50 percent charge. It was full when we left this morning.\u201d \u201cYou need to be able to jack it into that battery in the bike,\u201d I say, offering an unsolicited design critique. \u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201d he says, leaning into a chicane designed to slow traffic. A left, a right. The streets are getting wider: four lanes, then six. Traffic is moving faster and faster. Fadell is starting to sweat. \u201cI need to reboot. There\u2019s a bug in the phone. It\u2019s sucking power,\u201d he says. We glide to a stop at the edge of a deserted plaza near a train station so Fadell can reboot his iPhone. The reboot doesn\u2019t fix the bug. \u201cSuch is the life of a digital citizen,\u201d he sighs. I have an idea: I hand him my Android so he can continue to navigate, and we are off again. It\u2019s all downhill from here, and soon we are on a paved bike path. Fadell narrowly escapes a head-on collision with a helmeted mountain biker while trying to get his bearings from the unfamiliar phone. We\u2019ve got gravity at our back, trees to our left, and pedestrians to our right. We\u2019re laying down a groove in a dedicated bike lane carved out of an impossibly wide Parisian sidewalk. \u201cIt says we\u2019re here! Do you see it? It\u2019s just to our left somewhere,\u201d Fadell says, craning his neck, looking for the Expo center. Fadell\u2019s front wheel goes kerflooey against a half-inch granite curb delineating the edge of the bike lane, and he\u2019s thrown to the ground. The bicyclist behind us swerves to avoid the crash and curses at Fadell while he\u2019s down, splayed over his crumpled bike: \u201cMerde!\u201d My phone is yards away, having escaped Fadell\u2019s grip when he went flying. The screen is shattered. Fadell has dirt stains on the knees of his white jeans. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to put this in the story, are you?\u201d Fadell asks. Fadell never misses a chance to pooh-pooh the Valley. He made a fortune in Silicon Valley and now has left it for good. He\u2019s putting down roots in Paris. Nadav Kander The one problemwith moving to Paris was that Fadell had no real network there. Then he met Xavier Niel\u2014a man sometimes referred to as \u201cthe French Steve Jobs.\u201d He made his money as an internet entrepreneur and now, like Fadell, invests it. \u201cI was reading blogs and stuff, but I wanted to talk to other people in the business,\u201d Fadell tells me. \u201cAt the time, Paris wasn\u2019t a big tech city,\u201d says Niel, who recalls meeting Fadell early one afternoon in his office in 2009. It was a blind date bromance, and they talked for almost 10 hours straight. \u201cOh my God, we just bonded instantly,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cWe had similar backgrounds, just in different countries. He had an Apple II, I had an Apple II.\u201d \u201cWe spoke a lot about electronics \u2026\u201d Niel says. Fadell had an idea about a company of his own and was looking for collaborators. \u201cNest was burning inside me to be created,\u201d he says. Niel was an early investor. The Nest elevator pitch: home thermostat meets the iPhone. Nest was never simply about making a smarter, more beautiful thermostat, any more than the iPhone was about making a smarter, more beautiful phone. The business pitch was that, someday soon, every device in the average house\u2014every lock, appliance, power outlet, and light switch\u2014would be replaced by a fancy cloud-\u00adconnected gizmo. And what would connect this so-called internet of things? Who would provide the operating system to the houses and apartments we would all be living in? Well, Nest of course. Fadell moved back to Silicon Valley to build it with Matt Rogers, who had been Fadell\u2019s colleague at Apple. The company was incorporated in June 2010 and was in stealth mode for more than a year. Google\u2019s Sergey Brin saw a prototype early in 2011 and immediately moved to buy the company. Fadell said no. Steve Jobs heard about the thermostat and wanted to see it too, but by the time Fadell felt it was perfect enough to show to the perfectionist, Jobs was on his deathbed. He never saw it. The Nest thermostat debuted at the end of 2011 and earned Nest a raft of plaudits and design awards, and all the attention was making Fadell nervous. \u201cI have seen this before,\u201d he says, \u201cwhere you\u2019re the biggest fish in the smaller pond, and then all of a sudden the pond grows immensely because Google or Microsoft or Apple or Amazon or Samsung gets into it, and now you\u2019re a very tiny fish with these big, big, big whales.\u201d By the summer of 2013, the second product in the Nest family, a smart smoke detector, was about to come out, and Fadell was looking to raise more money through an investment round. \u201cWe had connected products, but what we wanted to do was connect the whole thing together. That was the vision of Nest. So how much money was it going to take?\u201d Fadell asks. The answer: a ton of money\u2014and time too. Meanwhile, Google was still interested in buying the company outright. Nest was starting to look like the key that could unlock a gazillion-dollar \u201cconnected home\u201d market, and acquiring Fadell seemed to be a chance to inject Google with some of the design DNA that had made Apple the most valuable company in the world. Fadell was pressed hard against the same dilemma he\u2019d faced at Fuse a decade earlier. He could bet everything on himself and risk losing\u2014or he could try to pursue his vision inside the confines of a warm corporate cocoon. This time the double bind wasn\u2019t so heartbreaking. Fadell wouldn\u2019t have to kill his company, because Nest would effectively live inside Google. Fadell could keep control while drawing on all the Google infrastructure he needed to build Nest into a connected-home platform. \u201cAll kinds of promises were made,\u201d Fadell says. Including, according to a source who saw the contract, a five-year \u201crunway\u201d\u2014a period of time in which Nest could spend and innovate freely with the goal of capturing the entire connected-\u00adhome ecosystem that everyone knew was coming. In January 2014, Google acquired Nest for $3.2 billion. Five months later, Google bought Dropcam, a smart home-security-camera company. The plan was to do some modifications, rebrand the system, and add the \u201cnew\u201d Nest Cam into Fadell\u2019s product line. That\u2019s what happened, but not before the former Dropcam CEO, Greg Duffy, attempted a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat early in 2015. According to an article on the news site The Information, Duffy sent an email to Google CEO Larry Page complaining about Fadell, his boss at Nest. He also recommended that Fadell be fired and suggested that he himself should replace Fadell. When Duffy\u2019s insubordinate power play got no response from Page, he quit Nest and, for good measure, says he told Fadell, \u201cI think you\u2019re running this company like a tyrant bureaucrat!\u201d before walking out. There\u2019s definitely a tyrannical streak in Fadell\u2014in a heated moment Fadell once asked his cofounder, Rogers, to postpone his honeymoon to help the Nest team meet some deadlines. (Rogers knew the storm would pass and took his honeymoon as scheduled.) But Fadell\u2019s real problem wasn\u2019t his so-called tyranny\u2014it was the new bureaucracy he suddenly found himself in. The month after Duffy transferred out of Nest, becoming an \u201centrepreneur in residence\u201d deep inside the Google death star, Ruth Porat was hired as Google\u2019s new CFO. Porat had deep roots in Silicon Valley\u2014her brother, Marc, was Fadell\u2019s boss at General Magic\u2014but Porat came from Wall Street. She was hired to bring financial discipline to Google. And indeed, within five months, Google announced that it was no longer \u201cGoogle\u201d anymore. It was Alphabet, a holding company that would contain at least a dozen divisions. There would be the core search-and-\u00adadvertising company called \u201cGoogle\u201d as well as what Alphabet called its \u201cother bets.\u201d Nest was one of the other bets, and as a division Nest would have to meet certain revenue goals, and its balance sheet would suddenly be subject to large overhead and other indirect charges from Alphabet. Fadell remembers the moment vividly. He thought he had a promise: five years in which to build Nest into the dominant connected-\u00adhome platform. But everything changed when Google morphed into Alphabet. \u201cThey decided there was a new regime in town, and they said, \u2018We\u2019re going to have all new metrics,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018This is not what we agreed to before,\u2019 because this was not just about fiscal things\u2014it was about getting married. I had never thought about being bought. It was about getting married to build a beautiful child, right?\u201d Fadell soldiered on under the new regime for four months, until at the end of 2015 he discovered that the new bottom-line-oriented Alphabet was going to sell Nest. \u201cAt that point I knew it wasn\u2019t going to work out, and that\u2019s when I came home to my wife, after a lot of struggles with the Alphabet thing. It wasn\u2019t working, it was, OK, it\u2019s over.\u201d Things went south after Fadell told Page that he wanted out in December of 2015. The tech blogs started circling, and the famously tight-lipped Google started leaking. Recode got ahold of a meme, created by someone inside the company, that showed a cartoon mob, torches raised high, behind the words \u201csell nest.\u201d The Information did a damning expos\u00e9, featuring Duffy\u2019s version of Nest as a bloated, ineffectual organization. In a follow-up blog post, Duffy accused Nest\u2019s leadership of \u201cfetishizing only the most superfluous and negative traits of their mentors\u201d\u2014in other words, Fadell had emulated Steve Jobs\u2019 dark side but not his capacity for getting things done. Fadell, of course, rejected the charges: In his view, Duffy was acting out of line, while Nest was racking up accomplishments at Google\u2014a regular drumbeat of significant hardware redesigns and new software services. Fadell felt blindsided by Duffy and hamstrung by legal agreements restricting what he could say publicly: \u201cI was disappointed Google did not step up to the line when these personal attacks were made on me and Nest,\u201d he says. Furthermore, Google threatened Fadell with legal action if Fadell went ahead and defended himself in the press\u2014this tidbit according to the same source who saw the five-year runway clause in the original purchase agreement between Google and Nest. Alphabet, which politely declined to comment on what exactly went wrong at Nest, whether Fadell quit or was fired, or even if there was any runway agreement in the first place, vehemently denies threatening Fadell with legal action. Whatever really happened behind closed doors, we do know for certain that by June 2016, Fadell had returned to Paris for good. \u201cAny VC who tells you that you have to move to Silicon Valley,\u201d Fadell says, gesticulating wildly, \u201cis being very lazy.\u201d Nadav Kander Given that Fadellhas tangled with major Silicon Valley companies and lost twice, it\u2019s hardly surprising that he decided to relocate to Paris. The surprising thing is that he may have found something better. At least that\u2019s the case Xavier Niel makes. Silicon Valley, Niel says, is for suckers. He ticks off the downsides: the sky-high salaries needed to attract engineers, the atrocious traffic, the relative dearth of cultural institutions, the isolation from the great cities of Europe \u2026 I am, to say the least, dubious: France is known for being unfavorable ground for businesses of all kinds\u2014especially startups. It has high taxes, rigid labor laws, and a culture that is averse to the free market. But I have to concede that Niel, a billionaire eight times over, is putting his money where his mouth is. He\u2019s making the case against Silicon Valley in the middle of Station F, a massive complex on the outskirts of Paris devoted exclusively to the care and feeding of startups. The building that houses it all is a former railroad terminal almost as long as the Eiffel Tower is tall and filled with a sea of desks\u2014more than 3,000 in all. Basically, it\u2019s a gargantuan coworking space, one that comes with all the amenities you\u2019d find in a big Silicon Valley company campus\u2014foosball tables, private conference rooms, fancy food courts, a chill zone, beanbag chairs. All of it is owned and operated by Niel. He operates as its landlord. Young entrepreneurs with an idea have to apply to get in, and if they do, they pay a nominal fee for a desk and plug-and-play access to the entire French entrepreneurial ecosystem. Looking down from all sides are offices of the permanent tenants: angel networks, VC firms, incubator and accelerator programs, outposts of large firms like Facebook and Microsoft looking to hire and acquire. Those tenants pay top dollar for the advantage of being in the same building with all the young guns. One of the nicest of the permanent offices belongs to Fadell. Future Shape, his fund, is now worth, he estimates, between $500 million and $1 billion. That\u2019s equivalent to a medium- or even large-size venture fund. But the difference is that, unlike a VC fund, Fadell doesn\u2019t have a bunch of limited partners backing him, tracking returns over (typically) a 10-year maturation period. Future Shape is all Fadell\u2019s money, so there\u2019s none of the usual VC pressure to IPO or be acquired. His personal balance sheet is not public, but financial lightning struck him twice: Both he and his wife got a bundle of Apple stock options back when AAPL was dirt cheap, and then he sold Nest to Google for $3.2 billion. \u201cIt\u2019s all covered,\u201d Fadell says, referring to his finances. \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d So the point of Future Shape, for Fadell, is finding those magic products\u2014like the iPhone or the Nest thermostat\u2014that need long runways but might change everything. \u201cAll of these incumbents with these big businesses that have been around for 100 or 200 years can be unseated,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cbecause technology is the unseating element, the levelizer.\u201d When Fadell talks about \u201ctechnology\u201d he means something a bit different than the usual definition. He waves off things like email and spreadsheets as mere bolt-ons to existing business models. His thesis is that almost every industry is up for grabs when and if someone like him redesigns the essential hardware with software and services baked in. It\u2019s the formula Fadell learned at General Magic and then applied at Apple and Nest. Everywhere he looks, he sees industries ripe for his particular brand of disruption: logistics and trucking, urban transportation, farming. It\u2019s an exceedingly familiar rap. Every venture fund claims that disruptive opportunity is everywhere\u2014it\u2019s the very premise of that type of investing\u2014and lots of them claim, for one reason or another, that they don\u2019t push their startups for exits. \u201cIf you\u2019re launching a startup today, don\u2019t go to Silicon Valley if you\u2019re not from there,\u201d Fadell tells a group of students. \u201cDon\u2019t do it!\u201d Fadell indulges in one heresy, however: an insistence that you no longer need to throw yourself at the feet of the Silicon Valley masters, as he did 25 years ago. \u201cIf you\u2019re launching a startup today, don\u2019t go to Silicon Valley if you\u2019re not from there,\u201d Fadell tells a group of awestruck students at a coding school that feeds its graduates into Station F. \u201cDon\u2019t do it! You\u2019re at an incredible disadvantage.\u201d It is clear that he\u2019s also talking about himself. In fact, whatever the audience, whether it\u2019s coding kids or the founders of Founders Forum, Fadell never misses a chance to pooh-pooh the Valley. Fadell made a fortune in Silicon Valley and now has left it for good. He\u2019s putting down roots in Paris. He studies with a French tutor every day and is getting fluent. His two kids are enrolled in the local \u00e9cole, and the headquarters of Future Shape\u2014the new business\u2014are inside Station F. You don\u2019t need Freud to figure out why. Look past the big wallet and the big ego and you see a guy who has been grievously hurt by the Silicon Valley system\u2014exploited and then betrayed, twice. First by Steve Jobs, who squeezed Fadell for all the juice he had and then publicly tossed him aside. The second time it was the same shit, different company\u2014Fadell was again sucker-punched on the way out. The wave of bad publicity while he was at Nest\u2014the Recode memes, the Information expos\u00e9\u2014came after Fadell told Page he wanted to leave Google. Sure, he might have failed altogether if it hadn\u2019t been for the support of Apple and Alphabet. And by one very important measure, Fadell succeeded stupendously, thanks to Silicon Valley: He walked away from both companies with huge piles of money. Maybe for mere mortals, money would be enough. But it wasn\u2019t for Jobs, who famously plotted and finally succeeded in winning back the control that Apple\u2019s early financiers took from him. Hardware is tough: Putting millions of things in the hands of millions of people requires large amounts of capital. And when someone gives you large amounts of capital, it often means you lose control. Elon Musk, who is two years younger than Fadell, is the first Silicon Valley hardware titan in generations to retain control of his inventions. Fadell seems to yearn to oversee his own dominion. This idea that he had to sell his babies is, I sense, what drives him. Fadell is almost pathologically compelled to say what\u2019s on his mind, and never in the week I spent shadowing him did he say anything that smacked of self-pity. But by the end of the week, it was clear what this third act of his career is about. He\u2019s trying to challenge a Silicon Valley\u00adcentric system that separated him from his creations. In Paris, he can pick out younger versions of himself, give them money and watch all the possible versions of his life story unfold again and again. In France, Fadell has a mini-\u00adreplica of Silicon Valley outside the Future Shape door. It\u2019s a place where he can pick out younger versions of himself, give them money, and\u2014in a sense\u2014watch all the possible versions of his own life story unfold again and again. \u201cMy job is to come here and bring Silicon Valley here,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s that cultural element that people are trying to replicate around the world, of taking risks and believing in yourself and changing the world, and there\u2019s no reason it can only be done in Silicon Valley.\u201d Fadell is the vector, the human tissue culture in a grand cloning experiment\u2014as well as the experimenter, tweaking the rules. What I see is a guy trying to prove to Silicon Valley that his way was the right way all along\u2014with the irony that he\u2019s trying to make that case in a high-tax country that has, so far, produced very few high tech companies of note. But who knows? It might just work. Station F is not some government-\u00adhatched \u201cdevelopment\u201d plan but rather the private gamble of a self-made tech billionaire, and Niel\u2019s stated goal is to have it pump out a thousand additional startups a year into what is one of Europe\u2019s biggest startup cities. \u201cIt\u2019s the ambition of all the people here, including Tony, as well as our new president Macron\u201d\u2014the young French president has met with both Fadell and Niel\u2014\u201cto help this ecosystem become huge.\u201d As for Fadell\u2019s Future Shape, it already includes chunks of some of the more promising non\u2013Silicon Valley companies going\u2014Superpedestrian in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Modern Meadow in Nutley, New Jersey; Convargo in Paris; DICE in London; CashShield in Singapore\u2014and to a person their CEOs have described Fadell\u2019s behind-the-scenes help as invaluable. Judging by the idolization that Fadell gets from young French coders, Future Shape will undoubtedly get early access to the startups that will emerge from Station F and elsewhere. His rock-star status is probably his main advantage as an investor. Will it be enough to beat Valley VCs at their own game? We\u2019ll see. But in another sense, Fadell\u2019s big bet on Paris has already paid off. Spiritually, he\u2019s back home\u2014to that Midwestern place where he was before he was sucked into Silicon Valley\u2019s vortex. He calls his own shots. He\u2019s a big fish in a small pond. He\u2019s in control. And this time around, Silicon Valley comes to him. \u201cTony meets more American tech people in Paris than in the US,\u201d Niel says. \u201cBecause if you are a big US tech manager, you come to Paris at least one or two times a year\u2014and when they do, they all call Tony!\u201d By all means, when you come to Paris, you should definitely look Fadell up. He\u2019s a wild man, a maverick, a bull in a china shop, and a lot of fun. But take one bit of advice from me: Whatever you do, don\u2019t let him borrow your phone.",

        "structuredText": "<div>   \n <p>Tony Fadell is at the Grove, a spectacularly beautiful country estate outside of London. The event is Founders Forum: the ultra \u00adexclusive invite-only tech conference. Prince William is in the house. The guest list is lousy with knights and lesser officers of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. Marissa Mayer, the now ex-CEO of Yahoo, and Biz Stone, recently returned to Twitter, are mingling with the other hundred or so invitees. But this is really Fadell\u2019s moment. </p> \n <p> It\u2019s almost exactly 10 years since the iPhone was released, and the media buzz is inescapable. The press is having trouble coming up with superlatives to describe the impact of a device that has sold more than a billion units. A new book, <a href=\"http://a.co/6TplyWy\">The One Device</a> , is lighting up the intertubes with fresh gossip about \u201cthe secret history of the iPhone.\u201d And Fadell\u2014both the source and the subject of that gossip\u2014is getting his due as one of the guys most responsible for turning Steve Jobs\u2019 one-device-to-rule-them-all vision into reality. </p> \n <p> The title of the afternoon session is \u201cWhat to Build Next?\u201d and Fadell is onstage with two other bona fide tech zillionaires\u2014Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m, the Skype guy; and Kevin Ryan, one of New York City\u2019s most successful internet entrepreneurs\u2014as well as a couple of other founder-\u00adinvestor types. Of the five people onstage, Fadell is the only one who helped build an object that every person in the audience has most likely used at one time or another. First Fadell helped build the iPod for <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/apple\">Apple</a> , then the iPhone, and then he ventured out on his own to build the Nest thermostat. </p> \n <p>Fadell is the star of the show, and he knows it. His self-confidence is well earned but can come across as overweening\u2014especially to those who suddenly find themselves in his shadow. \u201cAny VC who tells you that you have to move to Silicon Valley,\u201d Fadell says at one point, gesticulating wildly, \u201cis being very lazy.\u201d Two of the other people onstage are, in fact, from Silicon Valley venture capital firms, and their collars seem to squeeze a bit tighter. Fadell, in comparison, is supremely comfortable: relaxed and expansive in a pair of bright red sneakers\u2014no socks\u2014and a polo shirt. The moderator, wrapping things up, calls for a lightning round: a rapid-fire series of questions\u2014with only one-word answers allowed.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <div> \n  <h4>Related Stories</h4> \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"/story/disruption-is-how-silicon-valley-eats-its-young/\"> \n     <div> \n      <div> \n       <div> \n        <div></div> \n       </div> \n      </div> \n     </div> \n     <div> \n      <p>\"Disruption\" Is How Silicon Valley Eats Its Young</p> \n     </div></a></li> \n   <li><a href=\"/2017/05/can-denver-become-like-silicon-valley/\"> \n     <div> \n      <div> \n       <div> \n        <div></div> \n       </div> \n      </div> \n     </div> \n     <div> \n      <p>Can the American Heartland Remake Itself in the Image of Silicon Valley?

People want autographs, selfies, a word or two\u2014but the most persistent want money and advice. Like many of his contemporaries, Fadell makes personal investments as an angel, through a firm called Future Shape, with one important difference: He says he has a venture-size pool of money\u2014a portfolio of Future Shape investments worth more than half a billion dollars. Looking to make his escape, Fadell slips into the men\u2019s room. One persistent supplicant follows and, while Fadell is standing at the urinal, penis in hand, proceeds to make his pitch. It\u2019s a startup with a new design for a robotic arm. Fadell listens for less than a minute and, shaking off, says: \u201cA new robot arm? China is going to copy that in a second! What then? What\u2019s your value proposition?\u201d</p> \n <p>Faster, better, cheaper \u2026 blah blah blah.</p> \n <p>\u201cNot good enough!\u201d Fadell thinks, before offering some bland words of encouragement and dashing off to slip into the back seat of a black Mercedes-Benz S-class emblazoned with the AMG performance badge. As we start to speed toward central London to catch the afternoon Eurostar to Paris, he entertains the chauffeur (and me) with the penis-pitch story. \u201cI did like his persistence, though,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cI respect that.\u201d</p> \n <p>Turning philosophical, Fadell puts on his shades against the bright sun streaming through the backseat sunroof. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like being a film producer,\u201d he says, reflecting on his new role, post-Nest, as an investor. People pitch him, and if he likes their idea, it\u2019s go time.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>As if on cue, Fadell is forced to cut his reverie short to take a call from a young journalist doing a story on \u201cthe new culture of celebrity in tech.\u201d</p> \n <p>Did you ever think that tech would make you into a celebrity?</p> \n <p> \u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Fadell says. \u201cThe tech business in the \u201980s was Revenge of the Nerds . It was geeks. We were looked down upon, trodden upon \u2026\u201d Fadell is working himself into his trademark lather. \u201c\u2009\u2018Who are these crazy guys with pocket protectors and broken glasses?\u2019\u2009\u201d he asks rhetorically. \u201cSo you never thought that you were going to become a rock star,\u201d Fadell says, winding down, before quickly amending the thought. \u201cNot that I am,\u201d he says, \u201cbut that\u2019s what some people think.\u201d </p> \n <p>I don\u2019t think Fadell is a rock star, but I\u2019m quickly realizing that he is not your run-of-the-mill Silicon Valley billionaire making an early retirement out of an investing hobby either. For starters, he doesn\u2019t even live in the Valley anymore. He has moved to Paris. Permanently. And the more I learn about him, the more I begin to suspect that Silicon Valley\u2019s favorite son secretly hates the Valley. To hear Fadell tell it, he certainly has reason to.</p>   \n <p>Rewind to the early \u201990s. Fadell, a computer engineering major at the University of Michigan, has already tasted entrepreneurial success with a little education-software company called Constructive Instruments that he founded in his dorm room, but he wants more. \u201cI was getting very frustrated being a big fish in a little pond in Ann Arbor,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cand my eyes were looking at the West going, Silicon Valley , Silicon Valley , Silicon Valley .\u201d For a technologist like Fadell, there was no other place. Then, when news broke that a handful of Apple alumni\u2014including the hero-programmer behind the Mac, Andy Hertzfeld\u2014had escaped the mothership and banded together to form a new company, General Magic, Fadell saw his future. </p> \n <p> Not long after graduating in 1991, he showed up at General Magic\u2019s offices in Mountain View, California, early one midweek morning, unannounced. And because he was there before the receptionist, he just started wandering the halls, uncomfortable in his jacket and tie, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in hand. He eventually found some people to pester\u2014people who had clearly been there all night, hacking away. Leave us alone , kid . \u201cI was humbled in the first 10 minutes of being there,\u201d he says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, this is not like Michigan, I have got to be here, these are the smartest people ever, I have got to be working here. I have to be working here.\u2019\u201d </p> \n <p>The young Fadell had persistence, and it paid off: By the end of 1991 he had a job offer from General Magic. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have said, back then, \u2018This guy\u2019s going to change the world,\u2019 particularly,\u201d Hertzfeld says. \u201cHe was incredibly talented, very opinionated, obviously very bright, and physically very strong.\u201d</p> \n <p>At General Magic, Fadell joined a small team that was trying to build something the company had labeled a personal communicator. \u201cIt had email. It had downloadable apps. It had shopping. It had animations and graphics and games. It had telecommunications\u2014a phone, a built-in modem,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cIt was the iPhone 14 years too soon.\u201d It never got off the ground, and Magic ran out of tricks and cash by the early 2000s, but the experience was formative. \u201cHardware, software, services. That was the first link that I ever saw like that,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cThat has influenced everything I\u2019ve done since.\u201d</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>A few years after leaving General Magic, Fadell had his own startup, Fuse Systems. It was a hardware company that was attempting to capitalize on the Napster-\u00adfueled rise of the MP3 music format. Yves B\u00e9har, the noted product designer, remembers working with the nascent company: The idea was to make a full line of MP3-optimized music players\u2014everything from a component stereo system to a small portable Walkman-type device. \u201cTony was talking about a world where media, especially music, was going to be all digital,\u201d B\u00e9har says. \u201cAnd he got so excited and animated and passionate that he broke a chair\u2014he was just very physical, getting up and sitting down again\u2014and that became a joke: Tony\u2019s a kind of excitable guy who breaks the furniture.\u201d</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>To get the idea off the ground, Fadell rented an office in San Francisco\u2019s Telegraph Hill neighborhood and hired about a dozen people. Then Apple called. This was just after Jobs had returned to the company he founded and was struggling to save it from oblivion. Jobs was looking for a way out of a no-win battle with Microsoft and, like Fadell, had hit upon the idea of a portable MP3 player. Toshiba had just announced the launch of a small-\u00adformat disk drive that would give the Apple MP3 player a crucial advantage over the competition. But Apple needed someone who knew the tech forward and backward to build out a prototype. Executives asked him to come in to discuss something\u2014they were cagey about exactly what.</p> \n <p>Fadell assumed Apple needed some help designing a next-gen Newton and took the meeting. It was only after he signed the nondisclosure agreements that he discovered that the company wanted him to design a portable MP3 player\u2014the future iPod. In effect, Apple was asking Fadell for help in competing with himself. Yet if Fuse were to have any chance of survival, Fadell had to take the consulting gig at Apple, because Fuse needed another infusion of cash. The traditional sources of funding had shut down because the dotcom crash was already under way.</p> \n <p>Fadell put Fuse on autopilot and designed the iPod prototype for Apple in six short weeks. After he demonstrated how the iPod could be built\u2014which components, which interfaces, and at what price\u2014Jobs put Fadell into a double bind. He asked him to abandon the Fuse MP3 player designs and develop his idea inside Apple, which would mean killing his own company. It was agonizing for the young entrepreneur. \u201cI was just like, whoa!\u201d says Fadell, who even now gets worked up at the thought. \u201cI am like, \u2018Wait a second, I have a company, and there are people over there working on this other thing. How am I going to do this?\u2019 So I just got in my car, and I started driving through the hills of Saratoga and Los Gatos. I go up to Skyline, I wind up those roads, and I\u2019m just sitting there going, \u2018What am I going to do? What am I doing?\u2019\u201d</p> \n <p>In the end, Fadell didn\u2019t have much of a choice. The odds of Fuse succeeding on its own were not good. So he put his own dreams in a box and went to work for Apple as the head of the iPod project. The first iPod was not perfect, but it was still way better than the competition\u2014and as it was refined, it grew into a monster hit. Steve Wozniak, who watched it all happen from the inside, credits the iPod with turning the entire company around. \u201cIt made our revenues double, our profits double, and our stock double,\u201d he says. The iPod was a hit, and Fadell was a hero inside Apple.</p> \n <p>When Jobs announced that he had cancer in 2004, Fadell was on every list of potential successors. He even reminded people of the mercurial Apple founder, both in his ability to get things done and in the way he operated. \u201cTony is a little bit like Steve Jobs in the way he shaded the truth,\u201d says Hertzfeld, who was close to both men. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly lying, but it\u2019s expressing things in an advantageous way.\u201d</p> \n <p>The iPhone, which came out in 2007, was Fadell\u2019s last chapter at Apple. As the guy who built the iPod, he had earned the right to shape the company\u2019s next flagship product. The phone project started in earnest at the end of 2004. By that time, Fadell and his team had prototyped iPods that could also make phone calls. Fadell\u2019s design used the iPod\u2019s circular controller like a rotary dial. But there was another team inside Apple with a bigger idea\u2014the all-touch screen. And the competition between the two teams at times escalated into full-on corporate warfare.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <div>  \n  <p>\u201cTony started to adopt Steve Jobs\u2019 mannerisms and persona because it was a pressure cooker\u2014but also you emulate what works, right? And so everyone started screaming at each other.\u201d</p>  \n </div> \n <p>Fadell lost the battle over the iPhone\u2019s final design\u2014but, because of his previous success, he was still expected to build the hardware, a power-sharing situation that created all kinds of drama with Scott Forstall, Apple\u2019s legendary software guru. \u201cThis is when Steve\u2019s leadership and management style started to permeate the company,\u201d remembers Andy Grignon, the manager responsible for the \u201cphone\u201d part of the iPhone. \u201cTony started to adopt Steve\u2019s mannerisms and persona because it was a pressure cooker\u2014but also you emulate what works, right? And so everyone started screaming at each other. It became just like the thing to do: Fly off the fucking handle.\u201d And by the time the iPhone was ready to launch, it seemed Fadell was no longer the golden boy.</p> \n <p> Jobs appeared to confirm this fact in an exceptionally cruel way: The message was signaled from the stage at the very event where the iPhone was unveiled, on January 9, 2007. When Jobs was demonstrating the iPhone\u2019s contact list, he showed that he could delete a contact with one tap\u2014and the contact he deleted was \u201c <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0wQ7oL9pIIU\">Tony Fadell</a> .\u201d The public may not have thought twice about the gesture, but the Apple engineers in the audience understood exactly what was going on. \u201cPeople laughed about it, but everybody knew,\u201d Grignon says. \u201cSteve was in many ways diabolical, and Tony and Steve\u2019s relationship had grown increasingly rocky.\u201d Fadell insists that his relationship with Jobs remained solid, but he seems to have been pretty decisively outmaneuvered. \u201cThat demo script,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cwas created by Scott Forstall.\u201d (A source closely involved with the presentation says Jobs was ad-libbing.) Fadell and his wife, Danielle Lambert, also an Apple employee, eventually decided they\u2019d had enough and were gone by November 2008. Fadell says they left to spend more time with their kids. \u201cSteve was wondering why we didn\u2019t do it sooner,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cAnd then for a year, year and a half, we kind of went around the world.\u201d The city they liked best was Paris, so there they settled. They bought a big, beautiful apartment in the seventh arrondissement, started filling it with contemporary art, and enrolled their eldest son in the local school. </p>        \n <p>Fadell is in full manic panic, and those are the first words out of his mouth as I step into his garden courtyard in the seventh. It\u2019s early in the morning, the day after Founders Forum in London, and I\u2019m being escorted onto the premises by Fadell\u2019s PR person. Today she has scheduled Fadell for a long sit-down interview with me. But all of that has been forgotten, as Fadell has just been hit with some disturbing news. \u201cFucking Apple,\u201d he says. Fadell clams up after this outburst, but I later hear there is a dispute brewing between one of the Future Shape companies and Apple.</p> \n <p>Fadell has invested in hundreds of startup companies, and I have no idea which of them is butting heads with Apple. However, I do glean enough to understand that there is nothing unusual about the morning\u2019s drama. Fadell is a drama king: The more drama, the better. In fact, Fadell\u2019s PR person is a specialist in what has come to be called crisis PR, and she tells me that with Fadell, \u201cevery day is a new adventure.\u201d</p> \n <p>Indeed, the next thing I hear from Fadell is that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to go now.\u201d He has decided that, instead of sitting down for the interview this morning, he has to make an appearance at VivaTech\u2014the TechCrunch of Europe. He points to a pair of bikes waiting in the courtyard, outfitted with a device that gives them an electric boost. The devices are from a startup called Superpedestrian, and Fadell is an investor. The bet on e-bikes is emblematic of the types of investments he\u2019s looking for. He tends to like hardware startups. He looks for industries that are very stable, where the basic designs, tools, or materials have barely changed for a long time. Consider Modern Meadow, a Future Shape portfolio company, which is trying to replace cow leather with a lab-grown substitute. Then there\u2019s a heating and cooling company aiming to replace every compressor in every industrial refrigerator in the world with a solid-state thermoelectric cooler\u2014a chip, in essence. In Fadell\u2019s mind, the ultimate triumph would be a breakthrough battery: \u201cIf we have energy storage technologies that are very cheap and very efficient, then we\u2019re going to see wars stop, because no one is going to be fighting over oil reserves anymore.\u201d</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>We each take a bike and head into traffic, riding south on Boulevard Saint-Germain and then merging into traffic to veer onto Boulevard Raspail. Fadell has our destination\u2014the Paris Expo center\u2014dialed into his iPhone. It\u2019s only 4 miles away, but we are going to have to sprint to get there in time. There\u2019s only one problem: \u201cMy boost doesn\u2019t work!\u201d Fadell says.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>No matter, he just stands up on his pedals and grinds like a bike messenger who has just guzzled a gallon of espresso. Keeping up is not easy, even with my Superpedestrian-assisted superlegs, because Fadell is blowing through red lights, splitting lanes, squeezing through wormholes in moving traffic. And doing it all one-handed so he can keep an eye on the map.</p> \n <p>\u201cWatch out for cops, OK?\u201d he says as we blast through another busy intersection. \u201cIf they see me riding with my phone out, it\u2019s an automatic ticket.\u201d</p> \n <p>We\u2019re cranking, running with traffic on the Rue de Rennes, and then the second technical fail strikes.</p> \n <p>\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d Fadell grunts, glaring at his screen while spinning his crankset madly. \u201cMy phone is only at 50 percent charge. It was full when we left this morning.\u201d</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>\u201cYou need to be able to jack it into that battery in the bike,\u201d I say, offering an unsolicited design critique.</p> \n <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201d he says, leaning into a chicane designed to slow traffic.</p> \n <p>A left, a right. The streets are getting wider: four lanes, then six. Traffic is moving faster and faster. Fadell is starting to sweat.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>\u201cI need to reboot. There\u2019s a bug in the phone. It\u2019s sucking power,\u201d he says. We glide to a stop at the edge of a deserted plaza near a train station so Fadell can reboot his iPhone. The reboot doesn\u2019t fix the bug. \u201cSuch is the life of a digital citizen,\u201d he sighs.</p> \n <p>I have an idea: I hand him my Android so he can continue to navigate, and we are off again. It\u2019s all downhill from here, and soon we are on a paved bike path. Fadell narrowly escapes a head-on collision with a helmeted mountain biker while trying to get his bearings from the unfamiliar phone.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>We\u2019ve got gravity at our back, trees to our left, and pedestrians to our right. We\u2019re laying down a groove in a dedicated bike lane carved out of an impossibly wide Parisian sidewalk.</p> \n <p>\u201cIt says we\u2019re here! Do you see it? It\u2019s just to our left somewhere,\u201d Fadell says, craning his neck, looking for the Expo center.</p> \n <p>Fadell\u2019s front wheel goes kerflooey against a half-inch granite curb delineating the edge of the bike lane, and he\u2019s thrown to the ground. The bicyclist behind us swerves to avoid the crash and curses at Fadell while he\u2019s down, splayed over his crumpled bike: \u201cMerde!\u201d</p> \n <p>My phone is yards away, having escaped Fadell\u2019s grip when he went flying. The screen is shattered. Fadell has dirt stains on the knees of his white jeans.</p> \n <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to put this in the story, are you?\u201d Fadell asks.</p>    \n <div></div>  \n <div> \n  <p>Fadell never misses a chance to pooh-pooh the Valley. He made a fortune in Silicon Valley and now has left it for good. He\u2019s putting down roots in Paris.</p> \n </div> \n <div> Nadav Kander \n </div>   \n <p>The one problem with moving to Paris was that Fadell had no real network there. Then he met Xavier Niel\u2014a man sometimes referred to as \u201cthe French Steve Jobs.\u201d He made his money as an internet entrepreneur and now, like Fadell, invests it. \u201cI was reading blogs and stuff, but I wanted to talk to other people in the business,\u201d Fadell tells me. </p> \n <p>\u201cAt the time, Paris wasn\u2019t a big tech city,\u201d says Niel, who recalls meeting Fadell early one afternoon in his office in 2009. It was a blind date bromance, and they talked for almost 10 hours straight. \u201cOh my God, we just bonded instantly,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cWe had similar backgrounds, just in different countries. He had an Apple II, I had an Apple II.\u201d</p> \n <p>\u201cWe spoke a lot about electronics \u2026\u201d Niel says.</p> \n <p>Fadell had an idea about a company of his own and was looking for collaborators. \u201cNest was burning inside me to be created,\u201d he says. Niel was an early investor.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>The Nest elevator pitch: home thermostat meets the iPhone. Nest was never simply about making a smarter, more beautiful thermostat, any more than the iPhone was about making a smarter, more beautiful phone. The business pitch was that, someday soon, every device in the average house\u2014every lock, appliance, power outlet, and light switch\u2014would be replaced by a fancy cloud-\u00adconnected gizmo. And what would connect this so-called internet of things? Who would provide the operating system to the houses and apartments we would all be living in? Well, Nest of course.</p> \n <p>Fadell moved back to Silicon Valley to build it with Matt Rogers, who had been Fadell\u2019s colleague at Apple. The company was incorporated in June 2010 and was in stealth mode for more than a year. Google\u2019s Sergey Brin saw a prototype early in 2011 and immediately moved to buy the company. Fadell said no. Steve Jobs heard about the thermostat and wanted to see it too, but by the time Fadell felt it was perfect enough to show to the perfectionist, Jobs was on his deathbed. He never saw it.</p> \n <p>The Nest thermostat debuted at the end of 2011 and earned Nest a raft of plaudits and design awards, and all the attention was making Fadell nervous. \u201cI have seen this before,\u201d he says, \u201cwhere you\u2019re the biggest fish in the smaller pond, and then all of a sudden the pond grows immensely because Google or Microsoft or Apple or Amazon or Samsung gets into it, and now you\u2019re a very tiny fish with these big, big, big whales.\u201d</p> \n <p>By the summer of 2013, the second product in the Nest family, a smart smoke detector, was about to come out, and Fadell was looking to raise more money through an investment round. \u201cWe had connected products, but what we wanted to do was connect the whole thing together. That was the vision of Nest. So how much money was it going to take?\u201d Fadell asks. The answer: a ton of money\u2014and time too. Meanwhile, Google was still interested in buying the company outright. Nest was starting to look like the key that could unlock a gazillion-dollar \u201cconnected home\u201d market, and acquiring Fadell seemed to be a chance to inject Google with some of the design DNA that had made Apple the most valuable company in the world.</p> \n <p>Fadell was pressed hard against the same dilemma he\u2019d faced at Fuse a decade earlier. He could bet everything on himself and risk losing\u2014or he could try to pursue his vision inside the confines of a warm corporate cocoon. This time the double bind wasn\u2019t so heartbreaking. Fadell wouldn\u2019t have to kill his company, because Nest would effectively live inside Google. Fadell could keep control while drawing on all the Google infrastructure he needed to build Nest into a connected-home platform. \u201cAll kinds of promises were made,\u201d Fadell says. Including, according to a source who saw the contract, a five-year \u201crunway\u201d\u2014a period of time in which Nest could spend and innovate freely with the goal of capturing the entire connected-\u00adhome ecosystem that everyone knew was coming.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p> In January 2014, Google acquired Nest for $3.2 billion. Five months later, Google bought Dropcam, a smart home-security-camera company. The plan was to do some modifications, rebrand the system, and add the \u201cnew\u201d Nest Cam into Fadell\u2019s product line. That\u2019s what happened, but not before the former Dropcam CEO, Greg Duffy, attempted a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat early in 2015. According to an article on the news site The Information , Duffy sent an email to Google CEO Larry Page complaining about Fadell, his boss at Nest. He also recommended that Fadell be fired and suggested that he himself should replace Fadell. When Duffy\u2019s insubordinate power play got no response from Page, he quit Nest and, for good measure, says he told Fadell, \u201cI think you\u2019re running this company like a tyrant bureaucrat!\u201d before walking out. </p> \n <p>There\u2019s definitely a tyrannical streak in Fadell\u2014in a heated moment Fadell once asked his cofounder, Rogers, to postpone his honeymoon to help the Nest team meet some deadlines. (Rogers knew the storm would pass and took his honeymoon as scheduled.) But Fadell\u2019s real problem wasn\u2019t his so-called tyranny\u2014it was the new bureaucracy he suddenly found himself in.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <p>The month after Duffy transferred out of Nest, becoming an \u201centrepreneur in residence\u201d deep inside the Google death star, Ruth Porat was hired as Google\u2019s new CFO. Porat had deep roots in Silicon Valley\u2014her brother, Marc, was Fadell\u2019s boss at General Magic\u2014but Porat came from Wall Street.</p> \n <p> She was hired to bring financial discipline to Google. And indeed, within five months, Google announced that it was no longer \u201cGoogle\u201d anymore. It was <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/04/googles-alphabet-transition-tougher-b-c/\">Alphabet</a> , a holding company that would contain at least a dozen divisions. There would be the core search-and-\u00adadvertising company called \u201cGoogle\u201d as well as what Alphabet called its \u201cother bets.\u201d Nest was one of the other bets, and as a division Nest would have to meet certain revenue goals, and its balance sheet would suddenly be subject to large overhead and other indirect charges from Alphabet. </p> \n <p>Fadell remembers the moment vividly. He thought he had a promise: five years in which to build Nest into the dominant connected-\u00adhome platform. But everything changed when Google morphed into Alphabet. \u201cThey decided there was a new regime in town, and they said, \u2018We\u2019re going to have all new metrics,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018This is not what we agreed to before,\u2019 because this was not just about fiscal things\u2014it was about getting married. I had never thought about being bought. It was about getting married to build a beautiful child, right?\u201d</p> \n <p>Fadell soldiered on under the new regime for four months, until at the end of 2015 he discovered that the new bottom-line-oriented Alphabet was going to sell Nest. \u201cAt that point I knew it wasn\u2019t going to work out, and that\u2019s when I came home to my wife, after a lot of struggles with the Alphabet thing. It wasn\u2019t working, it was, OK, it\u2019s over.\u201d</p> \n <p> Things went south after Fadell told Page that he wanted out in December of 2015. The tech blogs started circling, and the famously tight-lipped Google started leaking. Recode got ahold of a meme, created by someone inside the company, that showed a cartoon mob, torches raised high, behind the words \u201csell nest.\u201d The Information  did a damning expos\u00e9, featuring Duffy\u2019s version of Nest as a bloated, ineffectual organization. In a follow-up blog post, Duffy accused Nest\u2019s leadership of \u201cfetishizing only the most superfluous and negative traits of their mentors\u201d\u2014in other words, Fadell had emulated Steve Jobs\u2019 dark side but not his capacity for getting things done. Fadell, of course, rejected the charges: In his view, Duffy was acting out of line, while Nest was racking up accomplishments at Google\u2014a regular drumbeat of significant hardware redesigns and new software services. Fadell felt blindsided by Duffy and hamstrung by legal agreements restricting what he could say publicly: \u201cI was disappointed Google did not step up to the line when these personal attacks were made on me and Nest,\u201d he says. Furthermore, Google threatened Fadell with legal action if Fadell went ahead and defended himself in the press\u2014this tidbit according to the same source who saw the five-year runway clause in the original purchase agreement between Google and Nest. Alphabet, which politely declined to comment on what exactly went wrong at Nest, whether Fadell quit or was fired, or even if there was any runway agreement in the first place, vehemently denies threatening Fadell with legal action. Whatever really happened behind closed doors, we do know for certain that by June 2016, Fadell had returned to Paris for good. </p>    \n <div></div>  \n <div> \n  <p>\u201cAny VC who tells you that you have to move to Silicon Valley,\u201d Fadell says, gesticulating wildly, \u201cis being very lazy.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <div> Nadav Kander \n </div>   \n <p>Given that Fadell has tangled with major Silicon Valley companies and lost twice, it\u2019s hardly surprising that he decided to relocate to Paris. The surprising thing is that he may have found something better. At least that\u2019s the case Xavier Niel makes. Silicon Valley, Niel says, is for suckers. He ticks off the downsides: the sky-high salaries needed to attract engineers, the atrocious traffic, the relative dearth of cultural institutions, the isolation from the great cities of Europe \u2026 </p> \n <p>I am, to say the least, dubious: France is known for being unfavorable ground for businesses of all kinds\u2014especially startups. It has high taxes, rigid labor laws, and a culture that is averse to the free market. But I have to concede that Niel, a billionaire eight times over, is putting his money where his mouth is. He\u2019s making the case against Silicon Valley in the middle of Station F, a massive complex on the outskirts of Paris devoted exclusively to the care and feeding of startups. The building that houses it all is a former railroad terminal almost as long as the Eiffel Tower is tall and filled with a sea of desks\u2014more than 3,000 in all. Basically, it\u2019s a gargantuan coworking space, one that comes with all the amenities you\u2019d find in a big Silicon Valley company campus\u2014foosball tables, private conference rooms, fancy food courts, a chill zone, beanbag chairs. All of it is owned and operated by Niel.</p> \n <p>He operates as its landlord. Young entrepreneurs with an idea have to apply to get in, and if they do, they pay a nominal fee for a desk and plug-and-play access to the entire French entrepreneurial ecosystem. Looking down from all sides are offices of the permanent tenants: angel networks, VC firms, incubator and accelerator programs, outposts of large firms like Facebook and Microsoft looking to hire and acquire. Those tenants pay top dollar for the advantage of being in the same building with all the young guns.</p> \n <p>One of the nicest of the permanent offices belongs to Fadell. Future Shape, his fund, is now worth, he estimates, between $500 million and $1 billion. That\u2019s equivalent to a medium- or even large-size venture fund. But the difference is that, unlike a VC fund, Fadell doesn\u2019t have a bunch of limited partners backing him, tracking returns over (typically) a 10-year maturation period. Future Shape is all Fadell\u2019s money, so there\u2019s none of the usual VC pressure to IPO or be acquired. His personal balance sheet is not public, but financial lightning struck him twice: Both he and his wife got a bundle of Apple stock options back when AAPL was dirt cheap, and then he sold Nest to Google for $3.2 billion. \u201cIt\u2019s all covered,\u201d Fadell says, referring to his finances. \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d So the point of Future Shape, for Fadell, is finding those magic products\u2014like the iPhone or the Nest thermostat\u2014that need long runways but might change everything.</p> \n <p>\u201cAll of these incumbents with these big businesses that have been around for 100 or 200 years can be unseated,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cbecause technology is the unseating element, the levelizer.\u201d When Fadell talks about \u201ctechnology\u201d he means something a bit different than the usual definition. He waves off things like email and spreadsheets as mere bolt-ons to existing business models. His thesis is that almost every industry is up for grabs when and if someone like him redesigns the essential hardware with software and services baked in. It\u2019s the formula Fadell learned at General Magic and then applied at Apple and Nest. Everywhere he looks, he sees industries ripe for his particular brand of disruption: logistics and trucking, urban transportation, farming.</p> \n <p>It\u2019s an exceedingly familiar rap. Every venture fund claims that disruptive opportunity is everywhere\u2014it\u2019s the very premise of that type of investing\u2014and lots of them claim, for one reason or another, that they don\u2019t push their startups for exits.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <div>  \n  <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re launching a startup today, don\u2019t go to Silicon Valley if you\u2019re not from there,\u201d Fadell tells a group of students. \u201cDon\u2019t do it!\u201d</p>  \n </div> \n <p>Fadell indulges in one heresy, however: an insistence that you no longer need to throw yourself at the feet of the Silicon Valley masters, as he did 25 years ago. \u201cIf you\u2019re launching a startup today, don\u2019t go to Silicon Valley if you\u2019re not from there,\u201d Fadell tells a group of awestruck students at a coding school that feeds its graduates into Station F. \u201cDon\u2019t do it! You\u2019re at an incredible disadvantage.\u201d It is clear that he\u2019s also talking about himself.</p> \n <p> In fact, whatever the audience, whether it\u2019s coding kids or the founders of Founders Forum, Fadell never misses a chance to pooh-pooh the Valley. Fadell made a fortune in Silicon Valley and now has left it for good. He\u2019s putting down roots in Paris. He studies with a French tutor every day and is getting fluent. His two kids are enrolled in the local \u00e9cole , and the headquarters of Future Shape\u2014the new business\u2014are inside Station F. </p> \n <p> You don\u2019t need Freud to figure out why. Look past the big wallet and the big ego and you see a guy who has been grievously hurt by the Silicon Valley system\u2014exploited and then betrayed, twice. First by Steve Jobs, who squeezed Fadell for all the juice he had and then publicly tossed him aside. The second time it was the same shit, different company\u2014Fadell was again sucker-punched on the way out. The wave of bad publicity while he was at Nest\u2014the Recode memes, the Information  expos\u00e9\u2014came after Fadell told Page he wanted to leave Google. </p> \n <p>Sure, he might have failed altogether if it hadn\u2019t been for the support of Apple and Alphabet. And by one very important measure, Fadell succeeded stupendously, thanks to Silicon Valley: He walked away from both companies with huge piles of money. Maybe for mere mortals, money would be enough. But it wasn\u2019t for Jobs, who famously plotted and finally succeeded in winning back the control that Apple\u2019s early financiers took from him. Hardware is tough: Putting millions of things in the hands of millions of people requires large amounts of capital. And when someone gives you large amounts of capital, it often means you lose control. Elon Musk, who is two years younger than Fadell, is the first Silicon Valley hardware titan in generations to retain control of his inventions. Fadell seems to yearn to oversee his own dominion. This idea that he had to sell his babies is, I sense, what drives him.</p> \n <p>Fadell is almost pathologically compelled to say what\u2019s on his mind, and never in the week I spent shadowing him did he say anything that smacked of self-pity. But by the end of the week, it was clear what this third act of his career is about. He\u2019s trying to challenge a Silicon Valley\u00adcentric system that separated him from his creations.</p> \n <div> \n  <div></div> \n </div> \n <div>  \n  <p>In Paris, he can pick out younger versions of himself, give them money and watch all the possible versions of his life story unfold again and again.</p>  \n </div> \n <p>In France, Fadell has a mini-\u00adreplica of Silicon Valley outside the Future Shape door. It\u2019s a place where he can pick out younger versions of himself, give them money, and\u2014in a sense\u2014watch all the possible versions of his own life story unfold again and again. \u201cMy job is to come here and bring Silicon Valley here,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s that cultural element that people are trying to replicate around the world, of taking risks and believing in yourself and changing the world, and there\u2019s no reason it can only be done in Silicon Valley.\u201d Fadell is the vector, the human tissue culture in a grand cloning experiment\u2014as well as the experimenter, tweaking the rules.</p> \n <p>What I see is a guy trying to prove to Silicon Valley that his way was the right way all along\u2014with the irony that he\u2019s trying to make that case in a high-tax country that has, so far, produced very few high tech companies of note. But who knows? It might just work. Station F is not some government-\u00adhatched \u201cdevelopment\u201d plan but rather the private gamble of a self-made tech billionaire, and Niel\u2019s stated goal is to have it pump out a thousand additional startups a year into what is one of Europe\u2019s biggest startup cities. \u201cIt\u2019s the ambition of all the people here, including Tony, as well as our new president Macron\u201d\u2014the young French president has met with both Fadell and Niel\u2014\u201cto help this ecosystem become huge.\u201d</p> \n <p>As for Fadell\u2019s Future Shape, it already includes chunks of some of the more promising non\u2013Silicon Valley companies going\u2014Superpedestrian in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Modern Meadow in Nutley, New Jersey; Convargo in Paris; DICE in London; CashShield in Singapore\u2014and to a person their CEOs have described Fadell\u2019s behind-the-scenes help as invaluable. Judging by the idolization that Fadell gets from young French coders, Future Shape will undoubtedly get early access to the startups that will emerge from Station F and elsewhere. His rock-star status is probably his main advantage as an investor. Will it be enough to beat Valley VCs at their own game? We\u2019ll see.</p> \n <p>But in another sense, Fadell\u2019s big bet on Paris has already paid off. Spiritually, he\u2019s back home\u2014to that Midwestern place where he was before he was sucked into Silicon Valley\u2019s vortex. He calls his own shots. He\u2019s a big fish in a small pond. He\u2019s in control. And this time around, Silicon Valley comes to him. \u201cTony meets more American tech people in Paris than in the US,\u201d Niel says. \u201cBecause if you are a big US tech manager, you come to Paris at least one or two times a year\u2014and when they do, they all call Tony!\u201d</p> \n <p>By all means, when you come to Paris, you should definitely look Fadell up. He\u2019s a wild man, a maverick, a bull in a china shop, and a lot of fun. But take one bit of advice from me: Whatever you do, don\u2019t let him borrow your phone.</p>  \n</div>",
        "text": "Tony Fadell isat the Grove, a spectacularly beautiful country estate outside of London. The event is Founders Forum: the ultra \u00adexclusive invite-only tech conference. Prince William is in the house. The guest list is lousy with knights and lesser officers of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. Marissa Mayer, the now ex-CEO of Yahoo, and Biz Stone, recently returned to Twitter, are mingling with the other hundred or so invitees. But this is really Fadell\u2019s moment. It\u2019s almost exactly 10 years since the iPhone was released, and the media buzz is inescapable. The press is having trouble coming up with superlatives to describe the impact of a device that has sold more than a billion units. A new book, The One Device, is lighting up the intertubes with fresh gossip about \u201cthe secret history of the iPhone.\u201d And Fadell\u2014both the source and the subject of that gossip\u2014is getting his due as one of the guys most responsible for turning Steve Jobs\u2019 one-device-to-rule-them-all vision into reality. The title of the afternoon session is \u201cWhat to Build Next?\u201d and Fadell is onstage with two other bona fide tech zillionaires\u2014Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m, the Skype guy; and Kevin Ryan, one of New York City\u2019s most successful internet entrepreneurs\u2014as well as a couple of other founder-\u00adinvestor types. Of the five people onstage, Fadell is the only one who helped build an object that every person in the audience has most likely used at one time or another. First Fadell helped build the iPod for Apple, then the iPhone, and then he ventured out on his own to build the Nest thermostat. Fadell is the star of the show, and he knows it. His self-confidence is well earned but can come across as overweening\u2014especially to those who suddenly find themselves in his shadow. \u201cAny VC who tells you that you have to move to Silicon Valley,\u201d Fadell says at one point, gesticulating wildly, \u201cis being very lazy.\u201d Two of the other people onstage are, in fact, from Silicon Valley venture capital firms, and their collars seem to squeeze a bit tighter. Fadell, in comparison, is supremely comfortable: relaxed and expansive in a pair of bright red sneakers\u2014no socks\u2014and a polo shirt. The moderator, wrapping things up, calls for a lightning round: a rapid-fire series of questions\u2014with only one-word answers allowed. Related Stories \"Disruption\" Is How Silicon Valley Eats Its Young Can the American Heartland Remake Itself in the Image of Silicon Valley? One Startup Finds Out How Silicon Valley Utopianism Brought You the Dystopian Trump Presidency What\u2019s the biggest problem facing the world right now? \u201cClimate,\u201d Fadell says. Then he adds, \u201cWe\u2019regoingtohavetogonuclear \u2026\u201d before being hushed by the moderator for busting the one-word rule. What\u2019s the next big thing in tech? \u201cComputational synthetic biology,\u201d Fadell says, bending the rules a second time. What is the one word that people who know you would use to describe you? With that, the panel is over, and Fadell is mobbed as he tries to leave the Grove\u2019s 18th-century manor. People want autographs, selfies, a word or two\u2014but the most persistent want money and advice. Like many of his contemporaries, Fadell makes personal investments as an angel, through a firm called Future Shape, with one important difference: He says he has a venture-size pool of money\u2014a portfolio of Future Shape investments worth more than half a billion dollars. Looking to make his escape, Fadell slips into the men\u2019s room. One persistent supplicant follows and, while Fadell is standing at the urinal, penis in hand, proceeds to make his pitch. It\u2019s a startup with a new design for a robotic arm. Fadell listens for less than a minute and, shaking off, says: \u201cA new robot arm? China is going to copy that in a second! What then? What\u2019s your value proposition?\u201d Faster, better, cheaper \u2026 blah blah blah. \u201cNot good enough!\u201d Fadell thinks, before offering some bland words of encouragement and dashing off to slip into the back seat of a black Mercedes-Benz S-class emblazoned with the AMG performance badge. As we start to speed toward central London to catch the afternoon Eurostar to Paris, he entertains the chauffeur (and me) with the penis-pitch story. \u201cI did like his persistence, though,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cI respect that.\u201d Turning philosophical, Fadell puts on his shades against the bright sun streaming through the backseat sunroof. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like being a film producer,\u201d he says, reflecting on his new role, post-Nest, as an investor. People pitch him, and if he likes their idea, it\u2019s go time. As if on cue, Fadell is forced to cut his reverie short to take a call from a young journalist doing a story on \u201cthe new culture of celebrity in tech.\u201d Did you ever think that tech would make you into a celebrity? \u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Fadell says. \u201cThe tech business in the \u201980s was Revenge of the Nerds. It was geeks. We were looked down upon, trodden upon \u2026\u201d Fadell is working himself into his trademark lather. \u201c\u2009\u2018Who are these crazy guys with pocket protectors and broken glasses?\u2019\u2009\u201d he asks rhetorically. \u201cSo you never thought that you were going to become a rock star,\u201d Fadell says, winding down, before quickly amending the thought. \u201cNot that I am,\u201d he says, \u201cbut that\u2019s what some people think.\u201d I don\u2019t think Fadell is a rock star, but I\u2019m quickly realizing that he is not your run-of-the-mill Silicon Valley billionaire making an early retirement out of an investing hobby either. For starters, he doesn\u2019t even live in the Valley anymore. He has moved to Paris. Permanently. And the more I learn about him, the more I begin to suspect that Silicon Valley\u2019s favorite son secretly hates the Valley. To hear Fadell tell it, he certainly has reason to. Rewind to theearly \u201990s. Fadell, a computer engineering major at the University of Michigan, has already tasted entrepreneurial success with a little education-software company called Constructive Instruments that he founded in his dorm room, but he wants more. \u201cI was getting very frustrated being a big fish in a little pond in Ann Arbor,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cand my eyes were looking at the West going, Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley.\u201d For a technologist like Fadell, there was no other place. Then, when news broke that a handful of Apple alumni\u2014including the hero-programmer behind the Mac, Andy Hertzfeld\u2014had escaped the mothership and banded together to form a new company, General Magic, Fadell saw his future. Not long after graduating in 1991, he showed up at General Magic\u2019s offices in Mountain View, California, early one midweek morning, unannounced. And because he was there before the receptionist, he just started wandering the halls, uncomfortable in his jacket and tie, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in hand. He eventually found some people to pester\u2014people who had clearly been there all night, hacking away. Leave us alone, kid. \u201cI was humbled in the first 10 minutes of being there,\u201d he says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, this is not like Michigan, I have got to be here, these are the smartest people ever, I have got to be working here. I have to be working here.\u2019\u201d The young Fadell had persistence, and it paid off: By the end of 1991 he had a job offer from General Magic. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have said, back then, \u2018This guy\u2019s going to change the world,\u2019 particularly,\u201d Hertzfeld says. \u201cHe was incredibly talented, very opinionated, obviously very bright, and physically very strong.\u201d At General Magic, Fadell joined a small team that was trying to build something the company had labeled a personal communicator. \u201cIt had email. It had downloadable apps. It had shopping. It had animations and graphics and games. It had telecommunications\u2014a phone, a built-in modem,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cIt was the iPhone 14 years too soon.\u201d It never got off the ground, and Magic ran out of tricks and cash by the early 2000s, but the experience was formative. \u201cHardware, software, services. That was the first link that I ever saw like that,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cThat has influenced everything I\u2019ve done since.\u201d A few years after leaving General Magic, Fadell had his own startup, Fuse Systems. It was a hardware company that was attempting to capitalize on the Napster-\u00adfueled rise of the MP3 music format. Yves B\u00e9har, the noted product designer, remembers working with the nascent company: The idea was to make a full line of MP3-optimized music players\u2014everything from a component stereo system to a small portable Walkman-type device. \u201cTony was talking about a world where media, especially music, was going to be all digital,\u201d B\u00e9har says. \u201cAnd he got so excited and animated and passionate that he broke a chair\u2014he was just very physical, getting up and sitting down again\u2014and that became a joke: Tony\u2019s a kind of excitable guy who breaks the furniture.\u201d To get the idea off the ground, Fadell rented an office in San Francisco\u2019s Telegraph Hill neighborhood and hired about a dozen people. Then Apple called. This was just after Jobs had returned to the company he founded and was struggling to save it from oblivion. Jobs was looking for a way out of a no-win battle with Microsoft and, like Fadell, had hit upon the idea of a portable MP3 player. Toshiba had just announced the launch of a small-\u00adformat disk drive that would give the Apple MP3 player a crucial advantage over the competition. But Apple needed someone who knew the tech forward and backward to build out a prototype. Executives asked him to come in to discuss something\u2014they were cagey about exactly what. Fadell assumed Apple needed some help designing a next-gen Newton and took the meeting. It was only after he signed the nondisclosure agreements that he discovered that the company wanted him to design a portable MP3 player\u2014the future iPod. In effect, Apple was asking Fadell for help in competing with himself. Yet if Fuse were to have any chance of survival, Fadell had to take the consulting gig at Apple, because Fuse needed another infusion of cash. The traditional sources of funding had shut down because the dotcom crash was already under way. Fadell put Fuse on autopilot and designed the iPod prototype for Apple in six short weeks. After he demonstrated how the iPod could be built\u2014which components, which interfaces, and at what price\u2014Jobs put Fadell into a double bind. He asked him to abandon the Fuse MP3 player designs and develop his idea inside Apple, which would mean killing his own company. It was agonizing for the young entrepreneur. \u201cI was just like, whoa!\u201d says Fadell, who even now gets worked up at the thought. \u201cI am like, \u2018Wait a second, I have a company, and there are people over there working on this other thing. How am I going to do this?\u2019 So I just got in my car, and I started driving through the hills of Saratoga and Los Gatos. I go up to Skyline, I wind up those roads, and I\u2019m just sitting there going, \u2018What am I going to do? What am I doing?\u2019\u201d In the end, Fadell didn\u2019t have much of a choice. The odds of Fuse succeeding on its own were not good. So he put his own dreams in a box and went to work for Apple as the head of the iPod project. The first iPod was not perfect, but it was still way better than the competition\u2014and as it was refined, it grew into a monster hit. Steve Wozniak, who watched it all happen from the inside, credits the iPod with turning the entire company around. \u201cIt made our revenues double, our profits double, and our stock double,\u201d he says. The iPod was a hit, and Fadell was a hero inside Apple. When Jobs announced that he had cancer in 2004, Fadell was on every list of potential successors. He even reminded people of the mercurial Apple founder, both in his ability to get things done and in the way he operated. \u201cTony is a little bit like Steve Jobs in the way he shaded the truth,\u201d says Hertzfeld, who was close to both men. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly lying, but it\u2019s expressing things in an advantageous way.\u201d The iPhone, which came out in 2007, was Fadell\u2019s last chapter at Apple. As the guy who built the iPod, he had earned the right to shape the company\u2019s next flagship product. The phone project started in earnest at the end of 2004. By that time, Fadell and his team had prototyped iPods that could also make phone calls. Fadell\u2019s design used the iPod\u2019s circular controller like a rotary dial. But there was another team inside Apple with a bigger idea\u2014the all-touch screen. And the competition between the two teams at times escalated into full-on corporate warfare. \u201cTony started to adopt Steve Jobs\u2019 mannerisms and persona because it was a pressure cooker\u2014but also you emulate what works, right? And so everyone started screaming at each other.\u201d Fadell lost the battle over the iPhone\u2019s final design\u2014but, because of his previous success, he was still expected to build the hardware, a power-sharing situation that created all kinds of drama with Scott Forstall, Apple\u2019s legendary software guru. \u201cThis is when Steve\u2019s leadership and management style started to permeate the company,\u201d remembers Andy Grignon, the manager responsible for the \u201cphone\u201d part of the iPhone. \u201cTony started to adopt Steve\u2019s mannerisms and persona because it was a pressure cooker\u2014but also you emulate what works, right? And so everyone started screaming at each other. It became just like the thing to do: Fly off the fucking handle.\u201d And by the time the iPhone was ready to launch, it seemed Fadell was no longer the golden boy. Jobs appeared to confirm this fact in an exceptionally cruel way: The message was signaled from the stage at the very event where the iPhone was unveiled, on January 9, 2007. When Jobs was demonstrating the iPhone\u2019s contact list, he showed that he could delete a contact with one tap\u2014and the contact he deleted was \u201cTony Fadell.\u201d The public may not have thought twice about the gesture, but the Apple engineers in the audience understood exactly what was going on. \u201cPeople laughed about it, but everybody knew,\u201d Grignon says. \u201cSteve was in many ways diabolical, and Tony and Steve\u2019s relationship had grown increasingly rocky.\u201d Fadell insists that his relationship with Jobs remained solid, but he seems to have been pretty decisively outmaneuvered. \u201cThat demo script,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cwas created by Scott Forstall.\u201d (A source closely involved with the presentation says Jobs was ad-libbing.) Fadell and his wife, Danielle Lambert, also an Apple employee, eventually decided they\u2019d had enough and were gone by November 2008. Fadell says they left to spend more time with their kids. \u201cSteve was wondering why we didn\u2019t do it sooner,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cAnd then for a year, year and a half, we kind of went around the world.\u201d The city they liked best was Paris, so there they settled. They bought a big, beautiful apartment in the seventh arrondissement, started filling it with contemporary art, and enrolled their eldest son in the local school. Fadell is in full manic panic, and those are the first words out of his mouth as I step into his garden courtyard in the seventh. It\u2019s early in the morning, the day after Founders Forum in London, and I\u2019m being escorted onto the premises by Fadell\u2019s PR person. Today she has scheduled Fadell for a long sit-down interview with me. But all of that has been forgotten, as Fadell has just been hit with some disturbing news. \u201cFucking Apple,\u201d he says. Fadell clams up after this outburst, but I later hear there is a dispute brewing between one of the Future Shape companies and Apple. Fadell has invested in hundreds of startup companies, and I have no idea which of them is butting heads with Apple. However, I do glean enough to understand that there is nothing unusual about the morning\u2019s drama. Fadell is a drama king: The more drama, the better. In fact, Fadell\u2019s PR person is a specialist in what has come to be called crisis PR, and she tells me that with Fadell, \u201cevery day is a new adventure.\u201d Indeed, the next thing I hear from Fadell is that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to go now.\u201d He has decided that, instead of sitting down for the interview this morning, he has to make an appearance at VivaTech\u2014the TechCrunch of Europe. He points to a pair of bikes waiting in the courtyard, outfitted with a device that gives them an electric boost. The devices are from a startup called Superpedestrian, and Fadell is an investor. The bet on e-bikes is emblematic of the types of investments he\u2019s looking for. He tends to like hardware startups. He looks for industries that are very stable, where the basic designs, tools, or materials have barely changed for a long time. Consider Modern Meadow, a Future Shape portfolio company, which is trying to replace cow leather with a lab-grown substitute. Then there\u2019s a heating and cooling company aiming to replace every compressor in every industrial refrigerator in the world with a solid-state thermoelectric cooler\u2014a chip, in essence. In Fadell\u2019s mind, the ultimate triumph would be a breakthrough battery: \u201cIf we have energy storage technologies that are very cheap and very efficient, then we\u2019re going to see wars stop, because no one is going to be fighting over oil reserves anymore.\u201d We each take a bike and head into traffic, riding south on Boulevard Saint-Germain and then merging into traffic to veer onto Boulevard Raspail. Fadell has our destination\u2014the Paris Expo center\u2014dialed into his iPhone. It\u2019s only 4 miles away, but we are going to have to sprint to get there in time. There\u2019s only one problem: \u201cMy boost doesn\u2019t work!\u201d Fadell says. No matter, he just stands up on his pedals and grinds like a bike messenger who has just guzzled a gallon of espresso. Keeping up is not easy, even with my Superpedestrian-assisted superlegs, because Fadell is blowing through red lights, splitting lanes, squeezing through wormholes in moving traffic. And doing it all one-handed so he can keep an eye on the map. \u201cWatch out for cops, OK?\u201d he says as we blast through another busy intersection. \u201cIf they see me riding with my phone out, it\u2019s an automatic ticket.\u201d We\u2019re cranking, running with traffic on the Rue de Rennes, and then the second technical fail strikes. \u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d Fadell grunts, glaring at his screen while spinning his crankset madly. \u201cMy phone is only at 50 percent charge. It was full when we left this morning.\u201d \u201cYou need to be able to jack it into that battery in the bike,\u201d I say, offering an unsolicited design critique. \u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201d he says, leaning into a chicane designed to slow traffic. A left, a right. The streets are getting wider: four lanes, then six. Traffic is moving faster and faster. Fadell is starting to sweat. \u201cI need to reboot. There\u2019s a bug in the phone. It\u2019s sucking power,\u201d he says. We glide to a stop at the edge of a deserted plaza near a train station so Fadell can reboot his iPhone. The reboot doesn\u2019t fix the bug. \u201cSuch is the life of a digital citizen,\u201d he sighs. I have an idea: I hand him my Android so he can continue to navigate, and we are off again. It\u2019s all downhill from here, and soon we are on a paved bike path. Fadell narrowly escapes a head-on collision with a helmeted mountain biker while trying to get his bearings from the unfamiliar phone. We\u2019ve got gravity at our back, trees to our left, and pedestrians to our right. We\u2019re laying down a groove in a dedicated bike lane carved out of an impossibly wide Parisian sidewalk. \u201cIt says we\u2019re here! Do you see it? It\u2019s just to our left somewhere,\u201d Fadell says, craning his neck, looking for the Expo center. Fadell\u2019s front wheel goes kerflooey against a half-inch granite curb delineating the edge of the bike lane, and he\u2019s thrown to the ground. The bicyclist behind us swerves to avoid the crash and curses at Fadell while he\u2019s down, splayed over his crumpled bike: \u201cMerde!\u201d My phone is yards away, having escaped Fadell\u2019s grip when he went flying. The screen is shattered. Fadell has dirt stains on the knees of his white jeans. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to put this in the story, are you?\u201d Fadell asks. Fadell never misses a chance to pooh-pooh the Valley. He made a fortune in Silicon Valley and now has left it for good. He\u2019s putting down roots in Paris. Nadav Kander The one problemwith moving to Paris was that Fadell had no real network there. Then he met Xavier Niel\u2014a man sometimes referred to as \u201cthe French Steve Jobs.\u201d He made his money as an internet entrepreneur and now, like Fadell, invests it. \u201cI was reading blogs and stuff, but I wanted to talk to other people in the business,\u201d Fadell tells me. \u201cAt the time, Paris wasn\u2019t a big tech city,\u201d says Niel, who recalls meeting Fadell early one afternoon in his office in 2009. It was a blind date bromance, and they talked for almost 10 hours straight. \u201cOh my God, we just bonded instantly,\u201d Fadell says. \u201cWe had similar backgrounds, just in different countries. He had an Apple II, I had an Apple II.\u201d \u201cWe spoke a lot about electronics \u2026\u201d Niel says. Fadell had an idea about a company of his own and was looking for collaborators. \u201cNest was burning inside me to be created,\u201d he says. Niel was an early investor. The Nest elevator pitch: home thermostat meets the iPhone. Nest was never simply about making a smarter, more beautiful thermostat, any more than the iPhone was about making a smarter, more beautiful phone. The business pitch was that, someday soon, every device in the average house\u2014every lock, appliance, power outlet, and light switch\u2014would be replaced by a fancy cloud-\u00adconnected gizmo. And what would connect this so-called internet of things? Who would provide the operating system to the houses and apartments we would all be living in? Well, Nest of course. Fadell moved back to Silicon Valley to build it with Matt Rogers, who had been Fadell\u2019s colleague at Apple. The company was incorporated in June 2010 and was in stealth mode for more than a year. Google\u2019s Sergey Brin saw a prototype early in 2011 and immediately moved to buy the company. Fadell said no. Steve Jobs heard about the thermostat and wanted to see it too, but by the time Fadell felt it was perfect enough to show to the perfectionist, Jobs was on his deathbed. He never saw it. The Nest thermostat debuted at the end of 2011 and earned Nest a raft of plaudits and design awards, and all the attention was making Fadell nervous. \u201cI have seen this before,\u201d he says, \u201cwhere you\u2019re the biggest fish in the smaller pond, and then all of a sudden the pond grows immensely because Google or Microsoft or Apple or Amazon or Samsung gets into it, and now you\u2019re a very tiny fish with these big, big, big whales.\u201d By the summer of 2013, the second product in the Nest family, a smart smoke detector, was about to come out, and Fadell was looking to raise more money through an investment round. \u201cWe had connected products, but what we wanted to do was connect the whole thing together. That was the vision of Nest. So how much money was it going to take?\u201d Fadell asks. The answer: a ton of money\u2014and time too. Meanwhile, Google was still interested in buying the company outright. Nest was starting to look like the key that could unlock a gazillion-dollar \u201cconnected home\u201d market, and acquiring Fadell seemed to be a chance to inject Google with some of the design DNA that had made Apple the most valuable company in the world. Fadell was pressed hard against the same dilemma he\u2019d faced at Fuse a decade earlier. He could bet everything on himself and risk losing\u2014or he could try to pursue his vision inside the confines of a warm corporate cocoon. This time the double bind wasn\u2019t so heartbreaking. Fadell wouldn\u2019t have to kill his company, because Nest would effectively live inside Google. Fadell could keep control while drawing on all the Google infrastructure he needed to build Nest into a connected-home platform. \u201cAll kinds of promises were made,\u201d Fadell says. Including, according to a source who saw the contract, a five-year \u201crunway\u201d\u2014a period of time in which Nest could spend and innovate freely with the goal of capturing the entire connected-\u00adhome ecosystem that everyone knew was coming. In January 2014, Google acquired Nest for $3.2 billion. Five months later, Google bought Dropcam, a smart home-security-camera company. The plan was to do some modifications, rebrand the system, and add the \u201cnew\u201d Nest Cam into Fadell\u2019s product line. That\u2019s what happened, but not before the former Dropcam CEO, Greg Duffy, attempted a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat early in 2015. According to an article on the news site The Information, Duffy sent an email to Google CEO Larry Page complaining about Fadell, his boss at Nest. He also recommended that Fadell be fired and suggested that he himself should replace Fadell. When Duffy\u2019s insubordinate power play got no response from Page, he quit Nest and, for good measure, says he told Fadell, \u201cI think you\u2019re running this company like a tyrant bureaucrat!\u201d before walking out. There\u2019s definitely a tyrannical streak in Fadell\u2014in a heated moment Fadell once asked his cofounder, Rogers, to postpone his honeymoon to help the Nest team meet some deadlines. (Rogers knew the storm would pass and took his honeymoon as scheduled.) But Fadell\u2019s real problem wasn\u2019t his so-called tyranny\u2014it was the new bureaucracy he suddenly found himself in. The month after Duffy transferred out of Nest, becoming an \u201centrepreneur in residence\u201d deep inside the Google death star, Ruth Porat was hired as Google\u2019s new CFO. Porat had deep roots in Silicon Valley\u2014her brother, Marc, was Fadell\u2019s boss at General Magic\u2014but Porat came from Wall Street. She was hired to bring financial discipline to Google. And indeed, within five months, Google announced that it was no longer \u201cGoogle\u201d anymore. It was Alphabet, a holding company that would contain at least a dozen divisions. There would be the core search-and-\u00adadvertising company called \u201cGoogle\u201d as well as what Alphabet called its \u201cother bets.\u201d Nest was one of the other bets, and as a division Nest would have to meet certain revenue goals, and its balance sheet would suddenly be subject to large overhead and other indirect charges from Alphabet. Fadell remembers the moment vividly. He thought he had a promise: five years in which to build Nest into the dominant connected-\u00adhome platform. But everything changed when Google morphed into Alphabet. \u201cThey decided there was a new regime in town, and they said, \u2018We\u2019re going to have all new metrics,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018This is not what we agreed to before,\u2019 because this was not just about fiscal things\u2014it was about getting married. I had never thought about being bought. It was about getting married to build a beautiful child, right?\u201d Fadell soldiered on under the new regime for four months, until at the end of 2015 he discovered that the new bottom-line-oriented Alphabet was going to sell Nest. \u201cAt that point I knew it wasn\u2019t going to work out, and that\u2019s when I came home to my wife, after a lot of struggles with the Alphabet thing. It wasn\u2019t working, it was, OK, it\u2019s over.\u201d Things went south after Fadell told Page that he wanted out in December of 2015. The tech blogs started circling, and the famously tight-lipped Google started leaking. Recode got ahold of a meme, created by someone inside the company, that showed a cartoon mob, torches raised high, behind the words \u201csell nest.\u201d The Information did a damning expos\u00e9, featuring Duffy\u2019s version of Nest as a bloated, ineffectual organization. In a follow-up blog post, Duffy accused Nest\u2019s leadership of \u201cfetishizing only the most superfluous and negative traits of their mentors\u201d\u2014in other words, Fadell had emulated Steve Jobs\u2019 dark side but not his capacity for getting things done. Fadell, of course, rejected the charges: In his view, Duffy was acting out of line, while Nest was racking up accomplishments at Google\u2014a regular drumbeat of significant hardware redesigns and new software services. Fadell felt blindsided by Duffy and hamstrung by legal agreements restricting what he could say publicly: \u201cI was disappointed Google did not step up to the line when these personal attacks were made on me and Nest,\u201d he says. Furthermore, Google threatened Fadell with legal action if Fadell went ahead and defended himself in the press\u2014this tidbit according to the same source who saw the five-year runway clause in the original purchase agreement between Google and Nest. Alphabet, which politely declined to comment on what exactly went wrong at Nest, whether Fadell quit or was fired, or even if there was any runway agreement in the first place, vehemently denies threatening Fadell with legal action. Whatever really happened behind closed doors, we do know for certain that by June 2016, Fadell had returned to Paris for good. \u201cAny VC who tells you that you have to move to Silicon Valley,\u201d Fadell says, gesticulating wildly, \u201cis being very lazy.\u201d Nadav Kander Given that Fadellhas tangled with major Silicon Valley companies and lost twice, it\u2019s hardly surprising that he decided to relocate to Paris. The surprising thing is that he may have found something better. At least that\u2019s the case Xavier Niel makes. Silicon Valley, Niel says, is for suckers. He ticks off the downsides: the sky-high salaries needed to attract engineers, the atrocious traffic, the relative dearth of cultural institutions, the isolation from the great cities of Europe \u2026 I am, to say the least, dubious: France is known for being unfavorable ground for businesses of all kinds\u2014especially startups. It has high taxes, rigid labor laws, and a culture that is averse to the free market. But I have to concede that Niel, a billionaire eight times over, is putting his money where his mouth is. He\u2019s making the case against Silicon Valley in the middle of Station F, a massive complex on the outskirts of Paris devoted exclusively to the care and feeding of startups. The building that houses it all is a former railroad terminal almost as long as the Eiffel Tower is tall and filled with a sea of desks\u2014more than 3,000 in all. Basically, it\u2019s a gargantuan coworking space, one that comes with all the amenities you\u2019d find in a big Silicon Valley company campus\u2014foosball tables, private conference rooms, fancy food courts, a chill zone, beanbag chairs. All of it is owned and operated by Niel. He operates as its landlord. Young entrepreneurs with an idea have to apply to get in, and if they do, they pay a nominal fee for a desk and plug-and-play access to the entire French entrepreneurial ecosystem. Looking down from all sides are offices of the permanent tenants: angel networks, VC firms, incubator and accelerator programs, outposts of large firms like Facebook and Microsoft looking to hire and acquire. Those tenants pay top dollar for the advantage of being in the same building with all the young guns. One of the nicest of the permanent offices belongs to Fadell. Future Shape, his fund, is now worth, he estimates, between $500 million and $1 billion. That\u2019s equivalent to a medium- or even large-size venture fund. But the difference is that, unlike a VC fund, Fadell doesn\u2019t have a bunch of limited partners backing him, tracking returns over (typically) a 10-year maturation period. Future Shape is all Fadell\u2019s money, so there\u2019s none of the usual VC pressure to IPO or be acquired. His personal balance sheet is not public, but financial lightning struck him twice: Both he and his wife got a bundle of Apple stock options back when AAPL was dirt cheap, and then he sold Nest to Google for $3.2 billion. \u201cIt\u2019s all covered,\u201d Fadell says, referring to his finances. \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d So the point of Future Shape, for Fadell, is finding those magic products\u2014like the iPhone or the Nest thermostat\u2014that need long runways but might change everything. \u201cAll of these incumbents with these big businesses that have been around for 100 or 200 years can be unseated,\u201d Fadell says, \u201cbecause technology is the unseating element, the levelizer.\u201d When Fadell talks about \u201ctechnology\u201d he means something a bit different than the usual definition. He waves off things like email and spreadsheets as mere bolt-ons to existing business models. His thesis is that almost every industry is up for grabs when and if someone like him redesigns the essential hardware with software and services baked in. It\u2019s the formula Fadell learned at General Magic and then applied at Apple and Nest. Everywhere he looks, he sees industries ripe for his particular brand of disruption: logistics and trucking, urban transportation, farming. It\u2019s an exceedingly familiar rap. Every venture fund claims that disruptive opportunity is everywhere\u2014it\u2019s the very premise of that type of investing\u2014and lots of them claim, for one reason or another, that they don\u2019t push their startups for exits. \u201cIf you\u2019re launching a startup today, don\u2019t go to Silicon Valley if you\u2019re not from there,\u201d Fadell tells a group of students. \u201cDon\u2019t do it!\u201d Fadell indulges in one heresy, however: an insistence that you no longer need to throw yourself at the feet of the Silicon Valley masters, as he did 25 years ago. \u201cIf you\u2019re launching a startup today, don\u2019t go to Silicon Valley if you\u2019re not from there,\u201d Fadell tells a group of awestruck students at a coding school that feeds its graduates into Station F. \u201cDon\u2019t do it! You\u2019re at an incredible disadvantage.\u201d It is clear that he\u2019s also talking about himself. In fact, whatever the audience, whether it\u2019s coding kids or the founders of Founders Forum, Fadell never misses a chance to pooh-pooh the Valley. Fadell made a fortune in Silicon Valley and now has left it for good. He\u2019s putting down roots in Paris. He studies with a French tutor every day and is getting fluent. His two kids are enrolled in the local \u00e9cole, and the headquarters of Future Shape\u2014the new business\u2014are inside Station F. You don\u2019t need Freud to figure out why. Look past the big wallet and the big ego and you see a guy who has been grievously hurt by the Silicon Valley system\u2014exploited and then betrayed, twice. First by Steve Jobs, who squeezed Fadell for all the juice he had and then publicly tossed him aside. The second time it was the same shit, different company\u2014Fadell was again sucker-punched on the way out. The wave of bad publicity while he was at Nest\u2014the Recode memes, the Information expos\u00e9\u2014came after Fadell told Page he wanted to leave Google. Sure, he might have failed altogether if it hadn\u2019t been for the support of Apple and Alphabet. And by one very important measure, Fadell succeeded stupendously, thanks to Silicon Valley: He walked away from both companies with huge piles of money. Maybe for mere mortals, money would be enough. But it wasn\u2019t for Jobs, who famously plotted and finally succeeded in winning back the control that Apple\u2019s early financiers took from him. Hardware is tough: Putting millions of things in the hands of millions of people requires large amounts of capital. And when someone gives you large amounts of capital, it often means you lose control. Elon Musk, who is two years younger than Fadell, is the first Silicon Valley hardware titan in generations to retain control of his inventions. Fadell seems to yearn to oversee his own dominion. This idea that he had to sell his babies is, I sense, what drives him. Fadell is almost pathologically compelled to say what\u2019s on his mind, and never in the week I spent shadowing him did he say anything that smacked of self-pity. But by the end of the week, it was clear what this third act of his career is about. He\u2019s trying to challenge a Silicon Valley\u00adcentric system that separated him from his creations. In Paris, he can pick out younger versions of himself, give them money and watch all the possible versions of his life story unfold again and again. In France, Fadell has a mini-\u00adreplica of Silicon Valley outside the Future Shape door. It\u2019s a place where he can pick out younger versions of himself, give them money, and\u2014in a sense\u2014watch all the possible versions of his own life story unfold again and again. \u201cMy job is to come here and bring Silicon Valley here,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s that cultural element that people are trying to replicate around the world, of taking risks and believing in yourself and changing the world, and there\u2019s no reason it can only be done in Silicon Valley.\u201d Fadell is the vector, the human tissue culture in a grand cloning experiment\u2014as well as the experimenter, tweaking the rules. What I see is a guy trying to prove to Silicon Valley that his way was the right way all along\u2014with the irony that he\u2019s trying to make that case in a high-tax country that has, so far, produced very few high tech companies of note. But who knows? It might just work. Station F is not some government-\u00adhatched \u201cdevelopment\u201d plan but rather the private gamble of a self-made tech billionaire, and Niel\u2019s stated goal is to have it pump out a thousand additional startups a year into what is one of Europe\u2019s biggest startup cities. \u201cIt\u2019s the ambition of all the people here, including Tony, as well as our new president Macron\u201d\u2014the young French president has met with both Fadell and Niel\u2014\u201cto help this ecosystem become huge.\u201d As for Fadell\u2019s Future Shape, it already includes chunks of some of the more promising non\u2013Silicon Valley companies going\u2014Superpedestrian in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Modern Meadow in Nutley, New Jersey; Convargo in Paris; DICE in London; CashShield in Singapore\u2014and to a person their CEOs have described Fadell\u2019s behind-the-scenes help as invaluable. Judging by the idolization that Fadell gets from young French coders, Future Shape will undoubtedly get early access to the startups that will emerge from Station F and elsewhere. His rock-star status is probably his main advantage as an investor. Will it be enough to beat Valley VCs at their own game? We\u2019ll see. But in another sense, Fadell\u2019s big bet on Paris has already paid off. Spiritually, he\u2019s back home\u2014to that Midwestern place where he was before he was sucked into Silicon Valley\u2019s vortex. He calls his own shots. He\u2019s a big fish in a small pond. He\u2019s in control. And this time around, Silicon Valley comes to him. \u201cTony meets more American tech people in Paris than in the US,\u201d Niel says. \u201cBecause if you are a big US tech manager, you come to Paris at least one or two times a year\u2014and when they do, they all call Tony!\u201d By all means, when you come to Paris, you should definitely look Fadell up. He\u2019s a wild man, a maverick, a bull in a china shop, and a lot of fun. But take one bit of advice from me: Whatever you do, don\u2019t let him borrow your phone.",

These companies were chosen from listings compiled by the <a href=\"https://nrf.com/2017-top-50-e-retailers-chart\">National Retail Federation</a> and <a href=\"http://wwd.com/business-news/business-features/amazon-wal-mart-apple-biggest-e-commerce-retailers-10862796/\">Women\u2019s Wear Daily</a>, both based on online sales.</p> \n <p>Across these companies, 12 different industries are represented including apparel, beauty, department store, electronics, footwear, home goods, home improvement, jewelry, office supplies, pharmacy, retail, and sporting goods.</p> \n <p>The organizations reviewed were Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co., Amazon, American Eagle Outfitters, Ann Taylor, Apple, Bath &amp; Body Works, Best Buy, Blue Nile, Cabela\u2019s, Carter\u2019s, Costco, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Dillard\u2019s, Express, Finish Line, Foot Locker, GAP, Home Depot, HSN, J.C. Penney, J.Crew, Kate Spade, Kohl\u2019s, L.L. Bean, Lands\u2019 End, Lowe\u2019s, Macy\u2019s, Neiman Marcus, NIKE, Nordstrom, Office Depot, Overstock, QVC, Ralph Lauren, Sears, Staples, Target, The North Face, Tiffany &amp; Co., Timberland, Ulta, Under Armour, Urban Outfitters, Vans, Victoria\u2019s Secret, Wal-Mart, Walgreens, Wayfair, Williams-Sonoma, and Zulily.</p> \n <p>These leading brands were analyzed across 19 tests to review both the optimizations driving results as well as the challenges they face reaching their goals with search.</p> \n <p>In addition to manually reviewing certain elements across each company, these tests were completed using BuzzSumo, SEMrush, Ahrefs, SpyFu, ScreamingFrog SEO Spider, Pingdom Website Speed Test, and Varvy SEO tool.</p> \n <p>For some of the completed tests, not all of the 50 brands were able to be analyzed as some tools were blocked from crawling certain websites.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Blogging certainly has many benefits, but there has always been a debate as to what the ideal publishing frequency an organization should aim for.</p> \n <p>Each of the 50 websites were manually reviewed to determine the average number of blog posts they\u2019ve published over the last eight months from January 2017 to August 2017.</p> \n <p>SpyFu was used to calculate the total number of organic keywords each organization ranked for and SEMrush to identify the total number of backlinks each site has.</p> \n <p>From our analysis, there isn\u2019t a clear correlation between an increase or decrease in links or organic keywords and how frequently a brand publishes a blog.</p> \n <p>Links and keywords increased with more blog posts published in some instances and the opposite was true as well for other companies on the list.</p> \n <p>From the data collected about these brands, it\u2019s fair to say that the quantity of content published doesn\u2019t have a definitive impact on an organization\u2019s SEO.</p> \n <p>Despite the results of this test, creating content is still a valuable way to drive SEO value as it\u2019s a viable means of attracting links, engagement, and loyalty from customers.</p> \n <p>While reviewing each brand, especially in the apparel category, it\u2019s clear that operating a blog is an important channel for communicating with customers as:</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Among the reviewed brands, the use of their blogs differed from sharing product updates, styling tips, news about their company and events, interviews with influential voices, and more.</p> \n <p>Most of these organizations have their blog hosted on their own websites, which is the ideal arrangement to reap the SEO benefits from regularly sharing content.</p> \n <p>Unfortunately, Victoria\u2019s Secret, Abercrombie, and a few others are only using Tumblr to blog, which certainly has advantages, but doesn\u2019t deliver the full SEO benefits.</p> \n <p>Instead, those brands should blog on both Tumblr and their own website like Nordstrom does or integrate their existing Tumblr onto their domain like Walgreens did with tumblr.walgreens.com.</p> \n <p>The number of blogs published doesn\u2019t have a clear impact on SEO. Although, most leading ecommerce brands are blogging to earn the activity\u2019s many benefits.</p> \n <p>There is no doubt that YouTube videos rank in Google search, but not all videos rank because many factors are considered as to whether a video is listed in the search results or not.</p> \n <p>One factor that increases the likelihood of a video ranking in YouTube or Google is if it\u2019s actually being watched, which is an indicator of quality and relevancy.</p> \n <p>Each of the brand\u2019s YouTube channels was manually reviewed to determine the number of videos with 20,000 views or more to be compared against the current number of organic keywords each company ranks for.</p> \n <p>There doesn\u2019t appear to be a positive or negative correlation between the number of quality YouTube videos a brand produces and the keywords they rank for.</p> \n <p>For example, reviewing this data illustrated that some brands that rank for over 100,000 keywords had zero videos over 20,000 views, while others had 152 videos.</p> \n <p>Every brand has a YouTube channel at varying levels of activeness, demonstrating that video is a key part of a marketing strategy for these organizations.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>There isn\u2019t an ideal number of videos to produce to achieve success, instead focus on the topics covered and how it\u2019s promoted.</p> \n <p>As a reference, the leading ecommerce brands have 120 videos on average with 20,000 views and up, but recognize that each company likely has many more videos on their channels that underperformed.</p> \n <p>Review the total number of videos a brand has on their channel as compared to this average to see that success with videos on YouTube requires learning from failed videos and testing different topics and types of videos.</p> \n <p>For instance, Neiman Marcus has 87 videos on their channel and only seven have generated over 20,000 views or Lowe\u2019s with 889 videos total and only 564 reaching 20,000 views.</p> \n <p>Views aren\u2019t the only metric to indicate the business value of a YouTube video, but they\u2019re a strong indicator of each video\u2019s overall performance.</p> \n <p>The views on a brand\u2019s videos don\u2019t directly correlate with the number of keywords it ranks for. Evaluate the YouTube channels of these brands for insights on what works.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>One indicator of a brand\u2019s success in search are the number of qualified keywords they rank highly for to reach the right people.</p> \n <p>Not all of the keywords a brand ranks for are likely targeted directly by the brand, but a majority are informed by the site\u2019s content and optimization.</p> \n <p>The SEO overview report from SpyFu was used to calculate the total number of unique organic keywords that appear for the 50 brands in the top 50 search results.</p> \n <p>Surprisingly, 60 percent, or 30 out of the 50 brands, reviewed rank for more than 50,000 organic keywords in search.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Use this data to inform your long-term approach to targeting keywords by starting with a small focused list initially and continuing to focus on keywords worth optimizing for.</p> \n <p>Every organization ranks for additional keywords that are connected to what they are specifically focusing on, but use the 50,000 mark as a reference when optimizing.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>There is a vast range in the number of keywords that some of these brand ranks for. Best Buy, Wayfair, Lowe\u2019s, and Overstock rank for more than 500,000 keywords, while companies like Ann Taylor, Kate Spade, and North Face rank for under 20,000 keywords.</p> \n <p>Although the length of time a brand has been active online influences the number of keywords it ranks for, this data provides insight into which brands focus on SEO.</p> \n <p>Most leading ecommerce brands rank for over 50,000 keywords, use this data as a reference when continuing to build your own list.</p> \n <p>The number of keywords a brand ranks for on the first page is a better measure of success than the total number of keywords it ranks for overall.</p> \n <p>SpyFu\u2019s SEO overview report was run to determine the total number of organic keywords that appear for the 50 leading ecommerce brands in the top 10 search results on the first page.</p> \n <p>Of the 50 ecommerce brands analyzed, 64 percent rank for less than 50,000 organic keywords on the first page of a Google search.</p> \n <p>First-page rankings for a particular keyword phrase are more difficult to achieve since there is more competition, which is why brands have far fewer keywords there.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>On average, over the total number of keywords a leading ecommerce brand ranks for, 23 percent rank on the first page of a Google search.</p> \n <p>Remember, there are many factors that impact why an enterprise ranks, such as the authority of the brand, which impacts their pages\u2019 popularity.</p> \n <p>Use the data below to identify which organizations are finding success with their approach to SEO to monitor what optimizations they\u2019re making and the content they\u2019re producing.</p> \n <p>Less than a quarter of a leading ecommerce brand\u2019s keywords rank on page one of Google, use this as a benchmark to analyze the impact of your keyword research.</p> \n <p>Many brands overoptimize their site for SEO by focusing too many pages on the same exact keywords, which is known as keyword cannibalization.</p> \n <p>Regardless of their intentions, this practice leads to diminished search authority for a brand as its own internal pages are competing against one another.</p> \n <p>Instead, an organization should choose a variety of related keywords that demonstrate the range of the company\u2019s expertise.</p> \n <p>Too often, cannibalization occurs by accident as the same metadata, like title tags, meta descriptions, and headers tags gets duplicated across multiple pages.</p> \n <p>The Screaming Frog SEO Spider tool was used to crawl 500 pages of 48 of the top ecommerce brands to identify the prevalence of duplicated metadata.</p> \n <p>Upon review, almost all the 48 brands had widespread duplication of their metadata across their website.</p> \n <p>Unfortunately, 93 percent of analyzed brands have over 100 instances of duplicated URLs, page titles, meta descriptions, meta keywords, and H1 and H2 header tags.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>For example, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. and American Eagle Outfitters each had over 2,500 instances of duplication in their metadata across 500 pages.</p> \n <p>Both brands should audit their website using a crawling tool to see where duplicates exist and make their metadata more distinct on every page.</p> \n <p>Prevent cannibalization of a company\u2019s keywords by running a monthly crawl report to identify what duplicates need to be corrected.</p> \n <p>Honorable Mention: Wayfair, an online home goods retailer, had the fewest instances of duplication across their website as compared to the 47 other reviewed brands.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>As one of the few retailers on this list to operate solely online, it makes sense that Wayfair is performing regular maintenance on their website for SEO and users alike.</p> \n <p>Most ecommerce brands have duplicated metadata on-site, likely affecting their rankings. Regularly audit your site to prevent the same issues from occurring.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>The goal of a title tag is to inform visitors what a particular page is about when they see it listed in SERPs and it is one of the factors the search engines review when ranking a page.</p> \n <p>It\u2019s essential to include relevant keywords within a title tag to accurately describe the content of a page, but it shouldn\u2019t be robotic and solely serve search engines.</p> \n <p>A highly effective title tag provides the necessary information to the search engines, while being an engaging 60 characters or less of text for people actually reading it.</p> \n <p>Narrative title tags include the right keywords but explain the subject of a page to incite action, express a brand\u2019s personality, or inform customers about a product or service.</p> \n <p>Here\u2019s an example of a narrative title tag HSN used for their travel accessories page:</p> \n <p>Travel Gear &amp; Accessories You Can\u2019t Travel Without | HSN</p> \n <p>This title tag includes keywords like travel gear, the brand\u2019s name, and a quirky phrase at the end to showcase the brand\u2019s personality and encourage customers to shop.</p> \n <p>As compared to a more keyword-driven title tag that\u2019s often overly simplified and only includes keywords like this one from Vans used to describe their backpack line:</p> \n <p>Realm Backpack | Shop at Vans</p> \n <p>The ideal scenario is to have a mix of the two types of title tags, but catered more to being narrative as they are better for serving both the search engines and customers.</p> \n <p>Screaming Frog was used to crawl 500 pages from each ecommerce brand to determine any patterns in the way title tags were written on their website.</p> \n <p>Most of the title tags found on the websites of the top ecommerce brands were heavily keyword focused.</p> \n <p>This is the case because it is easier for a company to craft a quick and simple title tag with the right keywords as opposed to taking a creative approach.</p> \n <p>It is surprising how few brands are making their title tags more narrative as every touchpoint across a website is an opportunity to connect a brand with its customers.</p> \n <p>Only 13 of the 50 ecommerce brands are using narrative elements in their title tags, showcasing an opportunity for an organization to stand out from these industry leaders.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Ulta, Neiman Marcus, Sears, and Blue Nile are some of the few companies adding a narrative element to their title tags, review their use of metadata for inspiration on how to account for readers and Google under a 60-character limit.</p> \n <p>Honorable Mention: For crafting narrative title tags, here are examples to learn from. Kate Spade and Victoria\u2019s Secret add colorful adjectives to their title tags to make them more interesting and aligned with their brand, while still catering to search engines.</p> \n <p>Totes \u2013 Smart, Carry-all Tote Bags for Timeless Style | Kate Spade New York</p> \n <p>Very Sexy Platinum For Him Cologne \u2013 Victoria\u2019s Secret</p> \n <p>Lowe\u2019s and Wayfair include verbs to incite action and describe how their offerings make people feel or how to use a product; consider including a relevant call-to-action.</p> \n <p>Queen Mattresses You\u2019ll Love | Wayfair</p> \n <p>Build a Deck-Top Pond \u2013 Lowe\u2019s</p> \n <p>These brands are also purposely including natural and relatable language that\u2019s similar to the way their customers talk, which helps their metadata resonate with readers.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>\u201cBrands need storytelling to captivate an audience whose digital attention is always being fought for. On the other hand, brands similarly need content to be found by search engines and to engage in social media.</p> \n <p>I would expect savvy brands to be optimizing their content for maximum exposure in search using keywords that a consumer might naturally use.</p> \n <p>At the same time, optimizing for the maximum shareability of their content in social media using a combination of hashtags, keywords, and perhaps more narrative title tags to garner interest and emotion.</p> \n <p>The lure to a company\u2019s content, whether it be through title tags and meta descriptions for search engines or customizing the way the content looks when it is shared on each social network, should be optimized for each channel to ensure maximum exposure.\u201d</p> \n <p>Most ecommerce brands fail to move beyond keyword-driven title tags. Instead, include a balance of storytelling and keywords in your title tags and other metadata.</p> \n <p>Writing a single title tag or meta description may seem insignificant, but the combined impact of optimizing all the pages across a website can make a noticeable difference.</p> \n <p>The websites of 48 leading ecommerce companies were crawled using Screaming Frog to determine how many pages from a sampling of 500 were optimized properly for SEO.</p> \n <p>Every ecommerce brand analyzed had a majority of their metadata optimized correctly.</p> \n <p>According to the crawl report, each ecommerce company had at least 80 percent of their site optimized with an accurate title tag, meta description, and H1 and H2 headers.</p> \n <p>Despite most pages being optimized correctly, there were still over 45,000 issues with metadata detected.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Brands most often had issues with their meta descriptions being too long or too short, missing an H2 tag, or their title tags being too brief, which is a missed opportunity to share useful information about the content included on a page.</p> \n <p>Pay attention to these important details as some of these optimizations impact how the search engines rank a website, influence a person\u2019s decision to visit a page or both.</p> \n <p>Keep pace with the leading ecommerce brands by ensuring your website is fully optimized with the proper metadata.</p> \n <p>Too often ecommerce sites showcase their products with only a product name, a duplicated description of the item from the manufacturer, and an image.</p> \n <p>Whether a product or a category page, including original copy is useful for providing information to shoppers and giving the search engines insights about the page.</p> \n <p>To determine any consistent on-page elements found on product pages, the top five most trafficked pages on each site, as reported by Ahrefs, were manually reviewed.</p> \n <p>Upon review, 54 percent of the top 50 ecommerce companies had original copy included on their most visited product and category pages.</p> \n <p>Most of the 27 brands that had copy on their top pages had over 100 words included either at the bottom of a category page or as part of an in-depth product description.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>These are additional elements that consistently appeared on the top performing product pages that likely impacts their performance in search:</p> \n <p></p> \n <p></p> \n <p></p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Expert Reflections:<a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/\">Rebekah Radice</a>, Founder and CMO of RadiantLA</p> \n <p>\u201cThat data is a strong case for the creation of original content. Unfortunately, this is one of the many challenges companies face. To combat a bandwidth issue, start with a simple search.</p> \n <p>Go to your Google Analytics dashboard and choose, \u201cBehavior -&gt; Site Content -&gt; All Pages.\u201d What you\u2019re looking for is top performing (trafficked) pages. Choose your top five pages based on relevance to your audience, unique pageviews, and bounce rate (the higher the more important to update).</p> \n <p>Now make minor tweaks by looking to the page content and asking if the introduction (first paragraph) explains the true nature of the page? Is the struggle you\u2019re solving for the reader clear? Are your keywords added naturally?</p> \n <p>Your goal is to update the content only as much is necessary to match the actual intent of your audience. The better you can make that connection, the better those top performing pages will convert.\u201d</p> \n <p>Honorable Mention: Gap includes useful copy on some of their category pages to serve both the search engines and its customers, as seen here at the bottom of their baby clothes page.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>The company includes over 300 words of copy on certain category pages that naturally integrate relevant keywords about the focus of the page.</p> \n <p>For their customers, the copy is organized into different sections providing details about the collection, its unique features, and tips on how to style the products effectively.</p> \n <p>Gap should continue this approach and add relevant copy across more of their most important category pages.</p> \n <p>Aim to both provide utility to readers with the copy included on product pages and enough keyword-rich text to provide the right context to the search engines.</p> \n <p>Integrate original copy across every page of a website to drive more traffic and improve the on-site experience for visitors.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Sharing on social media primarily drives awareness and engagement but doesn\u2019t have a direct impact on how a site ranks in search.</p> \n <p>However, the greater visibility social media provides may indirectly bring content to the attention of content creators, editors, site owners, and others who have the ability to feature this content and potentially drive links to the original resource.</p> \n <p>To determine if this correlation exists, 48 of the top ecommerce sites were reviewed using the most shared report from BuzzSumo.</p> \n <p>This report listed the number of links and social shares each page on these websites had earned, which were then organized by the top 40 most shared pages on social media.</p> \n <p>The number of links the top 20 pages had was compared to the total links the next 20 pages had to determine if more social shares coincided with a greater number of links.</p> \n <p>After reviewing this data, it became clear that most of the pages analyzed had more links when they had a higher number of shares on social media.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>For instance, Apple has 12,034 links on their top 20 most shared pages as compared to 7,195 links on the next 20 most shared pages \u2014 a difference of 4,839 links.</p> \n <p>Brands of all sizes should act on this data by developing product pages and content on their website that have elements ideal for sharing on social media.</p> \n <p>Too often, businesses create content, but neglect to come up with a proper distribution plan.</p> \n <p>Consider the many ways of gaining traction on social media like working with influencers, adding visual media, and including original information.</p> \n <p>There is a clear connection between the number of social shares and the backlinks a page earns. Create content that\u2019s social media friendly to indirectly drive links.</p> \n <p>Although an organization can indirectly impact the external links driven to their site, they do have direct control of their own internal links.</p> \n <p>An internal link is a link that points to another page on the same site helping the search engines understand how the site is organized and visitors easily navigate its pages.</p> \n <p>Linking to relevant phrases naturally throughout a website can help search engines better grasp the flow of PageRank and authority.</p> \n <p>The SEMrush site audit statistics report was calculated to determine the percentage of internal links included on 500 pages for 49 of the leading ecommerce brands.</p> \n <p>A majority of the top ecommerce brands analyzed have a reasonable amount of internal links across their sites.</p> \n <p>Thirty-nine out of the top 49 brands had 50+ internal links included on their pages, 38 companies had at least one and 35 companies had between two and five links.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>It is surprising to see that most brands embraced a technical SEO detail like internal linking, which indicates how important this element is to serve customers and Google.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Although the average number of internal links per site varied significantly, most of these links pointed to related products, corresponding category pages, or relevant content.</p> \n <p>Follow in the footsteps of these leading brands and add internal links throughout your website to create a simple navigation structure.</p> \n <p>Don\u2019t overdo it by including too many links on each page for the sake of including them, instead focus on adding links that provide value or assist with organization.</p> \n <p>Honorable Mention: Office Depot is an example of a brand with the optimal balance of internal links across their website.</p> \n <p>About half of their pages have 50+ internal links and the other half only have one internal link per page, while the rest of their site has two to 50 links across each page.</p> \n <p>This is a balanced approach as some pages shouldn\u2019t include too many links to ensure a visitor takes action, while others should include lots of links to provide options.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>When reviewing the links included on your website, ensure there are a diverse mix of quality internal links to match the different types of pages.</p> \n <p>For example, a blog post might include eight to 14 links to related content and products, while a product page only has four internal links included to recommended products.</p> \n <p>Brands should include a variety of quality internal links across their websites to help create a simple navigation structure for both visitors and search engines.</p> \n <p>Toxic links are spam links that are harmful to the credibility of a website in search. It is important for any ecommerce site to monitor the quality of their backlink profile to ensure they are able to flag toxic links for removal.</p> \n <p>The SEMrush backlink audit identified the number of toxic links each of the top 50 ecommerce websites had and then was compared to the site\u2019s number of organic keywords and estimated average monthly organic traffic as calculated by SpyFu.</p> \n <p>This test proved that there isn\u2019t a clear negative or positive correlation between the number of toxic links to organic keywords and monthly traffic.</p> \n <p>Some brands had a higher number of keywords and traffic even with a high percentage of toxic links, while others had the opposite arrangement.</p> \n <p>The test did reveal a potential impact of toxic links like how six of the top 10 sites with the highest percentage of toxic links ranked for less than 50,000 keywords.</p> \n <p>It\u2019s unclear if the presence of toxic links was the only cause for these lower number of organic keywords, but it\u2019s important to recognize that it may have been a factor.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>The brands with the highest amount of toxic links are Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods with 48,000 toxic links and North Face with nearly 26 percent of all their links identified as toxic.</p> \n <p>These organizations should audit their website to crawl all their existing links and begin manually identifying which are toxic and should be immediately disavowed.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>As a benchmark for how many bad links are common to have on a site, recognize that 74 percent of the leading ecommerce brands have link profiles that are less than 2 percent toxic.</p> \n <p>The other 26 percent of leading ecommerce brands had link profiles that were over 2 percent toxic, highlighting how prevalent the problem can become if not addressed properly.</p> \n <p>Every website has toxic links, but they mostly make up a small percentage of a site\u2019s total links. Run an analysis quarterly to identify which links need to be removed.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>According to Google, the <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/\">average time it takes</a> to fully load a mobile landing page is 22 seconds.</p> \n <p>A visitor\u2019s tolerance for a slow loading website on any device is low and Google takes a site\u2019s load time into consideration when ranking its pages.</p> \n <p>Both Pingdom and Google\u2019s Mobile Speed Test were used to determine the load time for 48 leading ecommerce brands on desktop and mobile.</p> \n <p>According to the analysis of the ecommerce leaders, their average mobile load time is 9.52 seconds and the average desktop load time is 2.94 seconds, faster than the industry average.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Most organizations from this analysis optimized their sites effectively, but others still must fix a range of issues to reduce load time to a reasonable length.</p> \n <p>The leading ecommerce brands lose an average of 26 percent of their visitors due to slow mobile page speeds, which can result in a significant loss of revenue.</p> \n <p>Neglecting to decrease mobile load times will continue to diminish the number of conversions a site drives in the long term as more transaction occur on devices.</p> \n <p>Use Pingdom or Google\u2019s Mobile Speed Test to determine your site\u2019s load time and to identify areas in need of improvement like page size, the number of redirects, and more.</p> \n <p>Honorable Mention: Nike had the best overall load time out of the 50 brands reviewed with a load time on desktop of 1.27 seconds and six seconds on mobile.</p> \n <p>Faster is better. Decrease the load time across devices below three seconds for the best customer experience and to slightly impact the search rankings.</p> \n <p>Large enterprise ecommerce sites use faceted navigation to make it easy for visitors to sort through options on a page like filtering a sweaters page by size, brand, or color.</p> \n <p>Faceted navigation makes it easier for customers to find the products they\u2019re looking for, which often means they\u2019re more likely to convert.</p> \n <p>Businesses fail to properly tag the navigation structure on their site leading to the search engines ranking multiple versions of the same pages.</p> \n <p>There are a few ways to alert the search engines as to how to crawl and index existing pages correctly like adding a noindex tag, adding canonical tags to identify which version of a series of pages deserves credit, disavowing sections of the site with the robots.txt, or by nofollowing all internal links that shouldn\u2019t be crawled.</p> \n <p>Each approach has pros and cons, <a href=\"https://moz.com/blog/large-site-seo-basics-faceted-navigation\">as analyzed on Moz\u2019s blog</a>, but there isn\u2019t one ideal solution other than initially building the navigation with the right JavaScript.</p> \n <p>Screaming Frog was used to crawl 500 pages of each site to determine which ecommerce brands are optimizing their faceted navigation with the right SEO tags.</p> \n <p>Most of the ecommerce brands analyzed did have these SEO tags on some of the pages on their websites.</p> \n <p>The use of these tags on certain pages may not have been for correcting issues with navigation, but without direct access to the site, we cannot be sure.</p> \n <p>Most of the leading ecommerce brands embrace the use of these SEO tags to ensure that the navigation for customers isn\u2019t negatively impacting their search rankings.</p> \n <p>When correcting issues with navigation on a website, add the appropriate SEO tags to alert Google to which pages to consider and which to ignore.</p> \n <p><a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/google-emails-warnings-webmasters-chrome-will-mark-http-pages-forms-not-secure-280907\">Google recently announced</a> that it will begin showing \u201cnot secure\u201d warnings in Chrome for any websites that allow a user to enter data on an HTTP page.</p> \n <p>Eventually, Google plans to show this warning for all HTTP pages on a site.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Providing security for visitors should be a key priority for an ecommerce site as customers need to trust that their private information will be kept safe.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>These warnings from Chrome and any hesitation a visitor might have shopping on a website can greatly decrease a site\u2019s conversion rate.</p> \n <p>Each of the 50 leading ecommerce websites were manually reviewed to see if they were secured with HTTPS or not.</p> \n <p>Most top ecommerce brands are using HTTPS to secure their entire website against misuse and to integrate more effectively with Chrome and tech that requires it.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Despite most organizations working to keep their sites secure, major brands like Carter\u2019s, Gap, Ralph Lauren, Ulta, Neiman Marcus, and others don\u2019t have HTTPS across their entire website, leaving customers at risk and reducing their conversion rates in the process.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Expert Reflections:<a href=\"http://www.aaronagius.com/\">Aaron Agius</a>, Co-Founder and Managing Director at Louder.Online</p> \n <p>\u201cI wish I could say I\u2019m surprised that sites (even industry leaders) aren\u2019t moving to HTTPS, given the benefits of doing so. It isn\u2019t just the upcoming addition of the \u2018Not Secure\u2019 notification in Chrome.</p> \n <p>Google has made it clear for some time that they\u2019re counting HTTPS as a ranking signal and indexing secure pages over unsecured ones.</p> \n <p>But making the move isn\u2019t as simple as installing a security certificate and calling it a day. Going to HTTPS requires changing internal links, adding the proper canonical links to your &lt;head&gt; section, making sure your CDN is HTTPS compatible and much more.</p> \n <p>Every step introduces potential complications; large sites are especially at risk, given their sheer number of moving parts. Errors in the process can lead to major crawling issues, duplicate content, and UX problems, which is why it\u2019s a good idea to work with an SEO professional who\u2019s familiar with HTTPS migrations \u2014 no matter what size your company is.\u201d</p> \n <p>Upgrade to HTTPS to encrypt sensitive data sent across a website and properly integrate with Chrome and other technology to protect visitors and maintain their trust.</p> \n <p>Understanding the consistent challenges ecommerce leaders face with SEO can help prioritize what issues your organization should look out for.</p> \n <p>The Varvy SEO tool was used to review 44 of the most prevalent ecommerce retailers to identify the presence of a sitemap, valid HTML, image alt text, and other SEO issues.</p> \n <p>Reviewing each of the 44 sites illustrated that leading ecommerce firms are dealing with an average of five major SEO-related issues.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>The most prominent issues these companies had across their websites were:</p> \n <p>The brands that were the most SEO friendly with only two issues detected were:</p> \n <p>Improving a website is an ongoing process that even top ecommerce brands need to continually work at. Identify the SEO issues facing your website and start optimizing.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>By 2020, there will be 200 billion monthly voice search queries, <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2016/6/1/11829844/mary-meeker-voice-image-searches-2020\">according to Mary Meeker\u2019s Trends Report</a>, highlighting why brands should integrate with popular voice services now.</p> \n <p>Google Home and Alexa are the two leading voice assistants that are competing aggressively to dominate the growing voice search industry.</p> \n <p>Brands can create customized experiences by developing an Alexa Skill or a Google Action to seamlessly integrate their own apps and offerings with these services.</p> \n <p>Beyond ranking organically for voice search, an integration at this level can help a brand better connect with consumers using these platforms.</p> \n <p>Both the marketplace for Alexa Skills and Google Actions was manually reviewed to determine which ecommerce brands have built integrations on these platforms.</p> \n <p>After reviewing the 50 leading ecommerce brands, a vast majority of these organizations don\u2019t have any integrations with Alexa or Google Home.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>The lack of major ecommerce brands developing integrations with these services presents an opportunity for your enterprise to start experimenting with these platforms.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Known as the first-mover advantage, by getting active and achieving success on a particular platform, in this case Alexa and/or Google Home, allows an organization to have a competitive edge before a network becomes oversaturated.</p> \n <p>Honorable Mention: Lowe\u2019s and Best Buy were the only brands with integrations on both Alexa and Google Home, focused on their connected devices, like smart thermostats.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Get ahead of the curve and develop a useful integration with one of the leading voice assistant services to reach customers as this technology continues to grow in popularity.</p> \n <p>At least 50 percent of <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/data-google-monthly-search-volume-dwarfs-rivals-mobile-advantage-269120\">Google\u2019s global search queries</a> are now from mobile devices, which should act as a reminder as to why it\u2019s essential to optimize for mobile search.</p> \n <p>Varvy\u2019s Mobile SEO tool was used to review 43 of these top retailers to identify the common optimizations made and the frequent issues these organizations faced.</p> \n <p>The most common mobile SEO challenges experienced by these brands were:</p> \n <p>According to Varvy, the tap targets across these sites weren\u2019t large enough as the mobile screen is small and needs big buttons for people to easily navigate by tapping.</p> \n <p>The rest of the common issues were speed-related errors as every brand had problems with browser caching and almost every site had render blocking CSS or JavaScript that slowed down the page load time.</p> \n <p>Most of the analyzed brands made the following optimizations for an optimal mobile experience:</p> \n <p>Pay attention to load time and the usability of a mobile site to help customers navigate the shopping experience and search engines accurately crawl it.</p> \n <p>Schema is code that can be added to any website to better inform the search engines about how to serve the site\u2019s content in the search results.</p> \n <p>Whether a site\u2019s pages showcase recipes, reviews, or music, adding schema will help the search engines understand the relevancy of a page as related to a search query.</p> \n <p>Consumers benefit, too, as the results for a page that\u2019s been marked up with structured data will more accurately reflect the type of information the site offers.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>For example, this recipe for True Texas Chili on Epicurious has been marked up as a recipe to appear in search with an image, ratings, reviews, and calorie count.</p> \n <p>The SEMrush Site Audit tool was used to crawl 500 pages from each of the 49 most successful ecommerce sites to determine how prominent the use of schema markup is, as well as open graph, Twitter cards, and microformats.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>A majority of the analyzed companies, 31 out of 49, use schema on at least 1 percent of their pages.</p> \n <p>Here\u2019s the breakdown of the frequency of schema markup used across the pages on these websites.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>It\u2019s clear that adding schema is widely adopted by top ecommerce sites, but most could certainly improve in terms of adding it to a larger percentage of their pages.</p> \n <p>The reason schema isn\u2019t more widely adopted across a larger portion of pages on many sites is because the process of adding markup can be time consuming.</p> \n <p>To best approach adding schema to your site, start small by first adding markup to the most important pages based on the sales, conversions, or traffic.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>In terms of the other types of markup used, Open Graph from Facebook is the most widely used, since the social network is a prevalent marketing medium.</p> \n <p>Start by adding schema and other relevant types of markup language to the most important pages to best present your site\u2019s content.</p> \n <p>Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) allow brands to load their pages quickly on mobile devices directly from Google search results.</p> \n <p>Available for any website to use for free, AMP pages load instantly, provide smooth scrolling, keep a page\u2019s existing styling and branding, and offer the ability to monetize ads.</p> \n <p><a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/google-releases-variety-accelerated-mobile-pages-project-amp-updates-scrolling-animations-video-analytics-fluid-ad-support-283776\">According to Google</a>, these pages load roughly four times faster and use one-tenth the data of pages and objects not built in AMP.</p> \n <p>A major benefit is that Google gives AMP pages priority in mobile search because it offers a better experience for users. AMP isn\u2019t a ranking signal but more of a preferred format by Google.</p> \n <p>The first three pages of mobile search results were reviewed manually and a 500-page crawl of each site was completed to detect the use of AMP by the top 49 ecommerce companies.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Only three of the 49 reviewed companies, Overstock, JCrew, and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, were using AMP on their website.</p> \n <p>This lack of AMP adoption for the moment is an opportunity for your organization to turn on AMP across relevant pages and stand out in search for the right reasons.</p> \n <p>Honorable Mention: While manually reviewing the mobile search results of these brands, it was surprising to see how often AMP pages would appear for these companies via Retale.</p> \n <p>A mobile deals and discounts app, Retale is the online version of a printed flyer showcasing current offers and coupons from a range of retailers.</p> \n <p>It appears that Retale also creates local listing pages for many of these brands with AMP to ensure their retail location\u2019s address, phone number, store hours, and weekly offers are featured prominently in Google search.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p></p> \n <p>It\u2019s unclear if Retale charges retailers for creating AMP pages for their local stores, but since this feature is free, it\u2019d be easy for these brands to implement them on their own site.</p> \n <p>These brands would likely earn more of the benefits of AMP by adding it on their website as compared to having their local listings managed by a third party.</p> \n <p>Implement AMP on your company\u2019s site to provide a seamless, fast experience for customers searching on mobile and to prioritize your pages and content in search.</p> \n <p>Combine these insights from the top 50 ecommerce brands with an ongoing audit of your site\u2019s progress to achieve success with search.</p> \n <p>Analyze where your organization stands on a quarterly basis and refer back to this data to evaluate how these ecommerce companies are approaching the same challenges.</p> \n <p>When evaluating this data, don\u2019t duplicate what the leading brands are doing exactly, but instead, apply the lessons learned to your company\u2019s unique circumstances.</p> \n <p>After analyzing these findings, it\u2019s time to take action and begin making the necessary optimizations to correct any errors and start experimenting to test new opportunities.</p> \n <p>Being more informed about the progress of industry leaders, changing technology, and evolving consumer needs will enable an enterprise to succeed with SEO.</p> \n</div>",
        "text": "Being discovered in search is one of the primary ways leading ecommerce brands generate traffic to their websites from new and returning customers alike. Though direct traffic generates 40 percent of an ecommerce site\u2019s referral traffic, search follows close behind with 34 percent of the total traffic driven, according to Smart Insights. Even though search plays an important role in bringing customers to an ecommerce site, it\u2019s difficult for even the big brands to dedicate enough time and resources to search. So, the goal of this study was to showcase where companies should prioritize their time when optimizing for search based on the approaches of leading ecommerce brands. Beyond addressing the foundational SEO tactics worth pursuing, a range of new opportunities are also explored in the study to give any organization a first-mover advantage against competitors. Here are some key takeaways from the study: The data for this research study was generated by reviewing the top 50 ecommerce retailers in the United States. These companies were chosen from listings compiled by the National Retail Federation and Women\u2019s Wear Daily, both based on online sales. Across these companies, 12 different industries are represented including apparel, beauty, department store, electronics, footwear, home goods, home improvement, jewelry, office supplies, pharmacy, retail, and sporting goods. The organizations reviewed were Abercrombie & Fitch Co., Amazon, American Eagle Outfitters, Ann Taylor, Apple, Bath & Body Works, Best Buy, Blue Nile, Cabela\u2019s, Carter\u2019s, Costco, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Dillard\u2019s, Express, Finish Line, Foot Locker, GAP, Home Depot, HSN, J.C. Penney, J.Crew, Kate Spade, Kohl\u2019s, L.L. Bean, Lands\u2019 End, Lowe\u2019s, Macy\u2019s, Neiman Marcus, NIKE, Nordstrom, Office Depot, Overstock, QVC, Ralph Lauren, Sears, Staples, Target, The North Face, Tiffany & Co., Timberland, Ulta, Under Armour, Urban Outfitters, Vans, Victoria\u2019s Secret, Wal-Mart, Walgreens, Wayfair, Williams-Sonoma, and Zulily. These leading brands were analyzed across 19 tests to review both the optimizations driving results as well as the challenges they face reaching their goals with search. In addition to manually reviewing certain elements across each company, these tests were completed using BuzzSumo, SEMrush, Ahrefs, SpyFu, ScreamingFrog SEO Spider, Pingdom Website Speed Test, and Varvy SEO tool. For some of the completed tests, not all of the 50 brands were able to be analyzed as some tools were blocked from crawling certain websites. Blogging certainly has many benefits, but there has always been a debate as to what the ideal publishing frequency an organization should aim for. Each of the 50 websites were manually reviewed to determine the average number of blog posts they\u2019ve published over the last eight months from January 2017 to August 2017. SpyFu was used to calculate the total number of organic keywords each organization ranked for and SEMrush to identify the total number of backlinks each site has. From our analysis, there isn\u2019t a clear correlation between an increase or decrease in links or organic keywords and how frequently a brand publishes a blog. Links and keywords increased with more blog posts published in some instances and the opposite was true as well for other companies on the list. From the data collected about these brands, it\u2019s fair to say that the quantity of content published doesn\u2019t have a definitive impact on an organization\u2019s SEO. Despite the results of this test, creating content is still a valuable way to drive SEO value as it\u2019s a viable means of attracting links, engagement, and loyalty from customers. While reviewing each brand, especially in the apparel category, it\u2019s clear that operating a blog is an important channel for communicating with customers as: Among the reviewed brands, the use of their blogs differed from sharing product updates, styling tips, news about their company and events, interviews with influential voices, and more. Most of these organizations have their blog hosted on their own websites, which is the ideal arrangement to reap the SEO benefits from regularly sharing content. Unfortunately, Victoria\u2019s Secret, Abercrombie, and a few others are only using Tumblr to blog, which certainly has advantages, but doesn\u2019t deliver the full SEO benefits. Instead, those brands should blog on both Tumblr and their own website like Nordstrom does or integrate their existing Tumblr onto their domain like Walgreens did with tumblr.walgreens.com. The number of blogs published doesn\u2019t have a clear impact on SEO. Although, most leading ecommerce brands are blogging to earn the activity\u2019s many benefits. There is no doubt that YouTube videos rank in Google search, but not all videos rank because many factors are considered as to whether a video is listed in the search results or not. One factor that increases the likelihood of a video ranking in YouTube or Google is if it\u2019s actually being watched, which is an indicator of quality and relevancy. Each of the brand\u2019s YouTube channels was manually reviewed to determine the number of videos with 20,000 views or more to be compared against the current number of organic keywords each company ranks for. There doesn\u2019t appear to be a positive or negative correlation between the number of quality YouTube videos a brand produces and the keywords they rank for. For example, reviewing this data illustrated that some brands that rank for over 100,000 keywords had zero videos over 20,000 views, while others had 152 videos. Every brand has a YouTube channel at varying levels of activeness, demonstrating that video is a key part of a marketing strategy for these organizations. There isn\u2019t an ideal number of videos to produce to achieve success, instead focus on the topics covered and how it\u2019s promoted. As a reference, the leading ecommerce brands have 120 videos on average with 20,000 views and up, but recognize that each company likely has many more videos on their channels that underperformed. Review the total number of videos a brand has on their channel as compared to this average to see that success with videos on YouTube requires learning from failed videos and testing different topics and types of videos. For instance, Neiman Marcus has 87 videos on their channel and only seven have generated over 20,000 views or Lowe\u2019s with 889 videos total and only 564 reaching 20,000 views. Views aren\u2019t the only metric to indicate the business value of a YouTube video, but they\u2019re a strong indicator of each video\u2019s overall performance. The views on a brand\u2019s videos don\u2019t directly correlate with the number of keywords it ranks for. Evaluate the YouTube channels of these brands for insights on what works. One indicator of a brand\u2019s success in search are the number of qualified keywords they rank highly for to reach the right people. Not all of the keywords a brand ranks for are likely targeted directly by the brand, but a majority are informed by the site\u2019s content and optimization. The SEO overview report from SpyFu was used to calculate the total number of unique organic keywords that appear for the 50 brands in the top 50 search results. Surprisingly, 60 percent, or 30 out of the 50 brands, reviewed rank for more than 50,000 organic keywords in search. Use this data to inform your long-term approach to targeting keywords by starting with a small focused list initially and continuing to focus on keywords worth optimizing for. Every organization ranks for additional keywords that are connected to what they are specifically focusing on, but use the 50,000 mark as a reference when optimizing. There is a vast range in the number of keywords that some of these brand ranks for. Best Buy, Wayfair, Lowe\u2019s, and Overstock rank for more than 500,000 keywords, while companies like Ann Taylor, Kate Spade, and North Face rank for under 20,000 keywords. Although the length of time a brand has been active online influences the number of keywords it ranks for, this data provides insight into which brands focus on SEO. Most leading ecommerce brands rank for over 50,000 keywords, use this data as a reference when continuing to build your own list. The number of keywords a brand ranks for on the first page is a better measure of success than the total number of keywords it ranks for overall. SpyFu\u2019s SEO overview report was run to determine the total number of organic keywords that appear for the 50 leading ecommerce brands in the top 10 search results on the first page. Of the 50 ecommerce brands analyzed, 64 percent rank for less than 50,000 organic keywords on the first page of a Google search. First-page rankings for a particular keyword phrase are more difficult to achieve since there is more competition, which is why brands have far fewer keywords there. On average, over the total number of keywords a leading ecommerce brand ranks for, 23 percent rank on the first page of a Google search. Remember, there are many factors that impact why an enterprise ranks, such as the authority of the brand, which impacts their pages\u2019 popularity. Use the data below to identify which organizations are finding success with their approach to SEO to monitor what optimizations they\u2019re making and the content they\u2019re producing. Less than a quarter of a leading ecommerce brand\u2019s keywords rank on page one of Google, use this as a benchmark to analyze the impact of your keyword research. Many brands overoptimize their site for SEO by focusing too many pages on the same exact keywords, which is known as keyword cannibalization. Regardless of their intentions, this practice leads to diminished search authority for a brand as its own internal pages are competing against one another. Instead, an organization should choose a variety of related keywords that demonstrate the range of the company\u2019s expertise. Too often, cannibalization occurs by accident as the same metadata, like title tags, meta descriptions, and headers tags gets duplicated across multiple pages. The Screaming Frog SEO Spider tool was used to crawl 500 pages of 48 of the top ecommerce brands to identify the prevalence of duplicated metadata. Upon review, almost all the 48 brands had widespread duplication of their metadata across their website. Unfortunately, 93 percent of analyzed brands have over 100 instances of duplicated URLs, page titles, meta descriptions, meta keywords, and H1 and H2 header tags. For example, Abercrombie & Fitch Co. and American Eagle Outfitters each had over 2,500 instances of duplication in their metadata across 500 pages. Both brands should audit their website using a crawling tool to see where duplicates exist and make their metadata more distinct on every page. Prevent cannibalization of a company\u2019s keywords by running a monthly crawl report to identify what duplicates need to be corrected. Honorable Mention: Wayfair, an online home goods retailer, had the fewest instances of duplication across their website as compared to the 47 other reviewed brands. As one of the few retailers on this list to operate solely online, it makes sense that Wayfair is performing regular maintenance on their website for SEO and users alike. Most ecommerce brands have duplicated metadata on-site, likely affecting their rankings. Regularly audit your site to prevent the same issues from occurring. The goal of a title tag is to inform visitors what a particular page is about when they see it listed in SERPs and it is one of the factors the search engines review when ranking a page. It\u2019s essential to include relevant keywords within a title tag to accurately describe the content of a page, but it shouldn\u2019t be robotic and solely serve search engines. A highly effective title tag provides the necessary information to the search engines, while being an engaging 60 characters or less of text for people actually reading it. Narrative title tags include the right keywords but explain the subject of a page to incite action, express a brand\u2019s personality, or inform customers about a product or service. Here\u2019s an example of a narrative title tag HSN used for their travel accessories page: Travel Gear & Accessories You Can\u2019t Travel Without | HSN This title tag includes keywords like travel gear, the brand\u2019s name, and a quirky phrase at the end to showcase the brand\u2019s personality and encourage customers to shop. As compared to a more keyword-driven title tag that\u2019s often overly simplified and only includes keywords like this one from Vans used to describe their backpack line: Realm Backpack | Shop at Vans The ideal scenario is to have a mix of the two types of title tags, but catered more to being narrative as they are better for serving both the search engines and customers. Screaming Frog was used to crawl 500 pages from each ecommerce brand to determine any patterns in the way title tags were written on their website. Most of the title tags found on the websites of the top ecommerce brands were heavily keyword focused. This is the case because it is easier for a company to craft a quick and simple title tag with the right keywords as opposed to taking a creative approach. It is surprising how few brands are making their title tags more narrative as every touchpoint across a website is an opportunity to connect a brand with its customers. Only 13 of the 50 ecommerce brands are using narrative elements in their title tags, showcasing an opportunity for an organization to stand out from these industry leaders. Ulta, Neiman Marcus, Sears, and Blue Nile are some of the few companies adding a narrative element to their title tags, review their use of metadata for inspiration on how to account for readers and Google under a 60-character limit. Honorable Mention: For crafting narrative title tags, here are examples to learn from. Kate Spade and Victoria\u2019s Secret add colorful adjectives to their title tags to make them more interesting and aligned with their brand, while still catering to search engines. Totes \u2013 Smart, Carry-all Tote Bags for Timeless Style | Kate Spade New York Very Sexy Platinum For Him Cologne \u2013 Victoria\u2019s Secret Lowe\u2019s and Wayfair include verbs to incite action and describe how their offerings make people feel or how to use a product; consider including a relevant call-to-action. Queen Mattresses You\u2019ll Love | Wayfair Build a Deck-Top Pond \u2013 Lowe\u2019s These brands are also purposely including natural and relatable language that\u2019s similar to the way their customers talk, which helps their metadata resonate with readers. \u201cBrands need storytelling to captivate an audience whose digital attention is always being fought for. On the other hand, brands similarly need content to be found by search engines and to engage in social media. I would expect savvy brands to be optimizing their content for maximum exposure in search using keywords that a consumer might naturally use. At the same time, optimizing for the maximum shareability of their content in social media using a combination of hashtags, keywords, and perhaps more narrative title tags to garner interest and emotion. The lure to a company\u2019s content, whether it be through title tags and meta descriptions for search engines or customizing the way the content looks when it is shared on each social network, should be optimized for each channel to ensure maximum exposure.\u201d Most ecommerce brands fail to move beyond keyword-driven title tags. Instead, include a balance of storytelling and keywords in your title tags and other metadata. Writing a single title tag or meta description may seem insignificant, but the combined impact of optimizing all the pages across a website can make a noticeable difference. The websites of 48 leading ecommerce companies were crawled using Screaming Frog to determine how many pages from a sampling of 500 were optimized properly for SEO. Every ecommerce brand analyzed had a majority of their metadata optimized correctly. According to the crawl report, each ecommerce company had at least 80 percent of their site optimized with an accurate title tag, meta description, and H1 and H2 headers. Despite most pages being optimized correctly, there were still over 45,000 issues with metadata detected. Brands most often had issues with their meta descriptions being too long or too short, missing an H2 tag, or their title tags being too brief, which is a missed opportunity to share useful information about the content included on a page. Pay attention to these important details as some of these optimizations impact how the search engines rank a website, influence a person\u2019s decision to visit a page or both. Keep pace with the leading ecommerce brands by ensuring your website is fully optimized with the proper metadata. Too often ecommerce sites showcase their products with only a product name, a duplicated description of the item from the manufacturer, and an image. Whether a product or a category page, including original copy is useful for providing information to shoppers and giving the search engines insights about the page. To determine any consistent on-page elements found on product pages, the top five most trafficked pages on each site, as reported by Ahrefs, were manually reviewed. Upon review, 54 percent of the top 50 ecommerce companies had original copy included on their most visited product and category pages. Most of the 27 brands that had copy on their top pages had over 100 words included either at the bottom of a category page or as part of an in-depth product description. These are additional elements that consistently appeared on the top performing product pages that likely impacts their performance in search: Expert Reflections:Rebekah Radice, Founder and CMO of RadiantLA \u201cThat data is a strong case for the creation of original content. Unfortunately, this is one of the many challenges companies face. To combat a bandwidth issue, start with a simple search. Go to your Google Analytics dashboard and choose, \u201cBehavior -> Site Content -> All Pages.\u201d What you\u2019re looking for is top performing (trafficked) pages. Choose your top five pages based on relevance to your audience, unique pageviews, and bounce rate (the higher the more important to update). Now make minor tweaks by looking to the page content and asking if the introduction (first paragraph) explains the true nature of the page? Is the struggle you\u2019re solving for the reader clear? Are your keywords added naturally? Your goal is to update the content only as much is necessary to match the actual intent of your audience. The better you can make that connection, the better those top performing pages will convert.\u201d Honorable Mention: Gap includes useful copy on some of their category pages to serve both the search engines and its customers, as seen here at the bottom of their baby clothes page. The company includes over 300 words of copy on certain category pages that naturally integrate relevant keywords about the focus of the page. For their customers, the copy is organized into different sections providing details about the collection, its unique features, and tips on how to style the products effectively. Gap should continue this approach and add relevant copy across more of their most important category pages. Aim to both provide utility to readers with the copy included on product pages and enough keyword-rich text to provide the right context to the search engines. Integrate original copy across every page of a website to drive more traffic and improve the on-site experience for visitors. Sharing on social media primarily drives awareness and engagement but doesn\u2019t have a direct impact on how a site ranks in search. However, the greater visibility social media provides may indirectly bring content to the attention of content creators, editors, site owners, and others who have the ability to feature this content and potentially drive links to the original resource. To determine if this correlation exists, 48 of the top ecommerce sites were reviewed using the most shared report from BuzzSumo. This report listed the number of links and social shares each page on these websites had earned, which were then organized by the top 40 most shared pages on social media. The number of links the top 20 pages had was compared to the total links the next 20 pages had to determine if more social shares coincided with a greater number of links. After reviewing this data, it became clear that most of the pages analyzed had more links when they had a higher number of shares on social media. For instance, Apple has 12,034 links on their top 20 most shared pages as compared to 7,195 links on the next 20 most shared pages \u2014 a difference of 4,839 links. Brands of all sizes should act on this data by developing product pages and content on their website that have elements ideal for sharing on social media. Too often, businesses create content, but neglect to come up with a proper distribution plan. Consider the many ways of gaining traction on social media like working with influencers, adding visual media, and including original information. There is a clear connection between the number of social shares and the backlinks a page earns. Create content that\u2019s social media friendly to indirectly drive links. Although an organization can indirectly impact the external links driven to their site, they do have direct control of their own internal links. An internal link is a link that points to another page on the same site helping the search engines understand how the site is organized and visitors easily navigate its pages. Linking to relevant phrases naturally throughout a website can help search engines better grasp the flow of PageRank and authority. The SEMrush site audit statistics report was calculated to determine the percentage of internal links included on 500 pages for 49 of the leading ecommerce brands. A majority of the top ecommerce brands analyzed have a reasonable amount of internal links across their sites. Thirty-nine out of the top 49 brands had 50+ internal links included on their pages, 38 companies had at least one and 35 companies had between two and five links. It is surprising to see that most brands embraced a technical SEO detail like internal linking, which indicates how important this element is to serve customers and Google. Although the average number of internal links per site varied significantly, most of these links pointed to related products, corresponding category pages, or relevant content. Follow in the footsteps of these leading brands and add internal links throughout your website to create a simple navigation structure. Don\u2019t overdo it by including too many links on each page for the sake of including them, instead focus on adding links that provide value or assist with organization. Honorable Mention: Office Depot is an example of a brand with the optimal balance of internal links across their website. About half of their pages have 50+ internal links and the other half only have one internal link per page, while the rest of their site has two to 50 links across each page. This is a balanced approach as some pages shouldn\u2019t include too many links to ensure a visitor takes action, while others should include lots of links to provide options. When reviewing the links included on your website, ensure there are a diverse mix of quality internal links to match the different types of pages. For example, a blog post might include eight to 14 links to related content and products, while a product page only has four internal links included to recommended products. Brands should include a variety of quality internal links across their websites to help create a simple navigation structure for both visitors and search engines. Toxic links are spam links that are harmful to the credibility of a website in search. It is important for any ecommerce site to monitor the quality of their backlink profile to ensure they are able to flag toxic links for removal. The SEMrush backlink audit identified the number of toxic links each of the top 50 ecommerce websites had and then was compared to the site\u2019s number of organic keywords and estimated average monthly organic traffic as calculated by SpyFu. This test proved that there isn\u2019t a clear negative or positive correlation between the number of toxic links to organic keywords and monthly traffic. Some brands had a higher number of keywords and traffic even with a high percentage of toxic links, while others had the opposite arrangement. The test did reveal a potential impact of toxic links like how six of the top 10 sites with the highest percentage of toxic links ranked for less than 50,000 keywords. It\u2019s unclear if the presence of toxic links was the only cause for these lower number of organic keywords, but it\u2019s important to recognize that it may have been a factor. The brands with the highest amount of toxic links are Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods with 48,000 toxic links and North Face with nearly 26 percent of all their links identified as toxic. These organizations should audit their website to crawl all their existing links and begin manually identifying which are toxic and should be immediately disavowed. As a benchmark for how many bad links are common to have on a site, recognize that 74 percent of the leading ecommerce brands have link profiles that are less than 2 percent toxic. The other 26 percent of leading ecommerce brands had link profiles that were over 2 percent toxic, highlighting how prevalent the problem can become if not addressed properly. Every website has toxic links, but they mostly make up a small percentage of a site\u2019s total links. Run an analysis quarterly to identify which links need to be removed. According to Google, the average time it takes to fully load a mobile landing page is 22 seconds. A visitor\u2019s tolerance for a slow loading website on any device is low and Google takes a site\u2019s load time into consideration when ranking its pages. Both Pingdom and Google\u2019s Mobile Speed Test were used to determine the load time for 48 leading ecommerce brands on desktop and mobile. According to the analysis of the ecommerce leaders, their average mobile load time is 9.52 seconds and the average desktop load time is 2.94 seconds, faster than the industry average. Most organizations from this analysis optimized their sites effectively, but others still must fix a range of issues to reduce load time to a reasonable length. The leading ecommerce brands lose an average of 26 percent of their visitors due to slow mobile page speeds, which can result in a significant loss of revenue. Neglecting to decrease mobile load times will continue to diminish the number of conversions a site drives in the long term as more transaction occur on devices. Use Pingdom or Google\u2019s Mobile Speed Test to determine your site\u2019s load time and to identify areas in need of improvement like page size, the number of redirects, and more. Honorable Mention: Nike had the best overall load time out of the 50 brands reviewed with a load time on desktop of 1.27 seconds and six seconds on mobile. Faster is better. Decrease the load time across devices below three seconds for the best customer experience and to slightly impact the search rankings. Large enterprise ecommerce sites use faceted navigation to make it easy for visitors to sort through options on a page like filtering a sweaters page by size, brand, or color. Faceted navigation makes it easier for customers to find the products they\u2019re looking for, which often means they\u2019re more likely to convert. Businesses fail to properly tag the navigation structure on their site leading to the search engines ranking multiple versions of the same pages. There are a few ways to alert the search engines as to how to crawl and index existing pages correctly like adding a noindex tag, adding canonical tags to identify which version of a series of pages deserves credit, disavowing sections of the site with the robots.txt, or by nofollowing all internal links that shouldn\u2019t be crawled. Each approach has pros and cons, as analyzed on Moz\u2019s blog, but there isn\u2019t one ideal solution other than initially building the navigation with the right JavaScript. Screaming Frog was used to crawl 500 pages of each site to determine which ecommerce brands are optimizing their faceted navigation with the right SEO tags. Most of the ecommerce brands analyzed did have these SEO tags on some of the pages on their websites. The use of these tags on certain pages may not have been for correcting issues with navigation, but without direct access to the site, we cannot be sure. Most of the leading ecommerce brands embrace the use of these SEO tags to ensure that the navigation for customers isn\u2019t negatively impacting their search rankings. When correcting issues with navigation on a website, add the appropriate SEO tags to alert Google to which pages to consider and which to ignore. Google recently announced that it will begin showing \u201cnot secure\u201d warnings in Chrome for any websites that allow a user to enter data on an HTTP page. Eventually, Google plans to show this warning for all HTTP pages on a site. Providing security for visitors should be a key priority for an ecommerce site as customers need to trust that their private information will be kept safe. These warnings from Chrome and any hesitation a visitor might have shopping on a website can greatly decrease a site\u2019s conversion rate. Each of the 50 leading ecommerce websites were manually reviewed to see if they were secured with HTTPS or not. Most top ecommerce brands are using HTTPS to secure their entire website against misuse and to integrate more effectively with Chrome and tech that requires it. Despite most organizations working to keep their sites secure, major brands like Carter\u2019s, Gap, Ralph Lauren, Ulta, Neiman Marcus, and others don\u2019t have HTTPS across their entire website, leaving customers at risk and reducing their conversion rates in the process. Expert Reflections:Aaron Agius, Co-Founder and Managing Director at Louder.Online \u201cI wish I could say I\u2019m surprised that sites (even industry leaders) aren\u2019t moving to HTTPS, given the benefits of doing so. It isn\u2019t just the upcoming addition of the \u2018Not Secure\u2019 notification in Chrome. Google has made it clear for some time that they\u2019re counting HTTPS as a ranking signal and indexing secure pages over unsecured ones. But making the move isn\u2019t as simple as installing a security certificate and calling it a day. Going to HTTPS requires changing internal links, adding the proper canonical links to your <head> section, making sure your CDN is HTTPS compatible and much more. Every step introduces potential complications; large sites are especially at risk, given their sheer number of moving parts. Errors in the process can lead to major crawling issues, duplicate content, and UX problems, which is why it\u2019s a good idea to work with an SEO professional who\u2019s familiar with HTTPS migrations \u2014 no matter what size your company is.\u201d Upgrade to HTTPS to encrypt sensitive data sent across a website and properly integrate with Chrome and other technology to protect visitors and maintain their trust. Understanding the consistent challenges ecommerce leaders face with SEO can help prioritize what issues your organization should look out for. The Varvy SEO tool was used to review 44 of the most prevalent ecommerce retailers to identify the presence of a sitemap, valid HTML, image alt text, and other SEO issues. Reviewing each of the 44 sites illustrated that leading ecommerce firms are dealing with an average of five major SEO-related issues. The most prominent issues these companies had across their websites were: The brands that were the most SEO friendly with only two issues detected were: Improving a website is an ongoing process that even top ecommerce brands need to continually work at. Identify the SEO issues facing your website and start optimizing. By 2020, there will be 200 billion monthly voice search queries, according to Mary Meeker\u2019s Trends Report, highlighting why brands should integrate with popular voice services now. Google Home and Alexa are the two leading voice assistants that are competing aggressively to dominate the growing voice search industry. Brands can create customized experiences by developing an Alexa Skill or a Google Action to seamlessly integrate their own apps and offerings with these services. Beyond ranking organically for voice search, an integration at this level can help a brand better connect with consumers using these platforms. Both the marketplace for Alexa Skills and Google Actions was manually reviewed to determine which ecommerce brands have built integrations on these platforms. After reviewing the 50 leading ecommerce brands, a vast majority of these organizations don\u2019t have any integrations with Alexa or Google Home. The lack of major ecommerce brands developing integrations with these services presents an opportunity for your enterprise to start experimenting with these platforms. Known as the first-mover advantage, by getting active and achieving success on a particular platform, in this case Alexa and/or Google Home, allows an organization to have a competitive edge before a network becomes oversaturated. Honorable Mention: Lowe\u2019s and Best Buy were the only brands with integrations on both Alexa and Google Home, focused on their connected devices, like smart thermostats. Get ahead of the curve and develop a useful integration with one of the leading voice assistant services to reach customers as this technology continues to grow in popularity. At least 50 percent of Google\u2019s global search queries are now from mobile devices, which should act as a reminder as to why it\u2019s essential to optimize for mobile search. Varvy\u2019s Mobile SEO tool was used to review 43 of these top retailers to identify the common optimizations made and the frequent issues these organizations faced. The most common mobile SEO challenges experienced by these brands were: According to Varvy, the tap targets across these sites weren\u2019t large enough as the mobile screen is small and needs big buttons for people to easily navigate by tapping. The rest of the common issues were speed-related errors as every brand had problems with browser caching and almost every site had render blocking CSS or JavaScript that slowed down the page load time. Most of the analyzed brands made the following optimizations for an optimal mobile experience: Pay attention to load time and the usability of a mobile site to help customers navigate the shopping experience and search engines accurately crawl it. Schema is code that can be added to any website to better inform the search engines about how to serve the site\u2019s content in the search results. Whether a site\u2019s pages showcase recipes, reviews, or music, adding schema will help the search engines understand the relevancy of a page as related to a search query. Consumers benefit, too, as the results for a page that\u2019s been marked up with structured data will more accurately reflect the type of information the site offers. For example, this recipe for True Texas Chili on Epicurious has been marked up as a recipe to appear in search with an image, ratings, reviews, and calorie count. The SEMrush Site Audit tool was used to crawl 500 pages from each of the 49 most successful ecommerce sites to determine how prominent the use of schema markup is, as well as open graph, Twitter cards, and microformats. A majority of the analyzed companies, 31 out of 49, use schema on at least 1 percent of their pages. Here\u2019s the breakdown of the frequency of schema markup used across the pages on these websites. It\u2019s clear that adding schema is widely adopted by top ecommerce sites, but most could certainly improve in terms of adding it to a larger percentage of their pages. The reason schema isn\u2019t more widely adopted across a larger portion of pages on many sites is because the process of adding markup can be time consuming. To best approach adding schema to your site, start small by first adding markup to the most important pages based on the sales, conversions, or traffic. In terms of the other types of markup used, Open Graph from Facebook is the most widely used, since the social network is a prevalent marketing medium. Start by adding schema and other relevant types of markup language to the most important pages to best present your site\u2019s content. Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) allow brands to load their pages quickly on mobile devices directly from Google search results. Available for any website to use for free, AMP pages load instantly, provide smooth scrolling, keep a page\u2019s existing styling and branding, and offer the ability to monetize ads. According to Google, these pages load roughly four times faster and use one-tenth the data of pages and objects not built in AMP. A major benefit is that Google gives AMP pages priority in mobile search because it offers a better experience for users. AMP isn\u2019t a ranking signal but more of a preferred format by Google. The first three pages of mobile search results were reviewed manually and a 500-page crawl of each site was completed to detect the use of AMP by the top 49 ecommerce companies. Only three of the 49 reviewed companies, Overstock, JCrew, and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, were using AMP on their website. This lack of AMP adoption for the moment is an opportunity for your organization to turn on AMP across relevant pages and stand out in search for the right reasons. Honorable Mention: While manually reviewing the mobile search results of these brands, it was surprising to see how often AMP pages would appear for these companies via Retale. A mobile deals and discounts app, Retale is the online version of a printed flyer showcasing current offers and coupons from a range of retailers. It appears that Retale also creates local listing pages for many of these brands with AMP to ensure their retail location\u2019s address, phone number, store hours, and weekly offers are featured prominently in Google search. It\u2019s unclear if Retale charges retailers for creating AMP pages for their local stores, but since this feature is free, it\u2019d be easy for these brands to implement them on their own site. These brands would likely earn more of the benefits of AMP by adding it on their website as compared to having their local listings managed by a third party. Implement AMP on your company\u2019s site to provide a seamless, fast experience for customers searching on mobile and to prioritize your pages and content in search. Combine these insights from the top 50 ecommerce brands with an ongoing audit of your site\u2019s progress to achieve success with search. Analyze where your organization stands on a quarterly basis and refer back to this data to evaluate how these ecommerce companies are approaching the same challenges. When evaluating this data, don\u2019t duplicate what the leading brands are doing exactly, but instead, apply the lessons learned to your company\u2019s unique circumstances. After analyzing these findings, it\u2019s time to take action and begin making the necessary optimizations to correct any errors and start experimenting to test new opportunities. Being more informed about the progress of industry leaders, changing technology, and evolving consumer needs will enable an enterprise to succeed with SEO.",

Although, most leading ecommerce brands are blogging to earn the activity\u2019s many benefits.</p> \n <p>There is no doubt that YouTube videos rank in Google search, but not all videos rank because many factors are considered as to whether a video is listed in the search results or not.</p> \n <p>One factor that increases the likelihood of a video ranking in YouTube or Google is if it\u2019s actually being watched, which is an indicator of quality and relevancy.</p> \n <p>Each of the brand\u2019s YouTube channels was manually reviewed to determine the number of videos with 20,000 views or more to be compared against the current number of organic keywords each company ranks for.</p> \n <p>There doesn\u2019t appear to be a positive or negative correlation between the number of quality YouTube videos a brand produces and the keywords they rank for.</p> \n <p>For example, reviewing this data illustrated that some brands that rank for over 100,000 keywords had zero videos over 20,000 views, while others had 152 videos.</p> \n <p>Every brand has a YouTube channel at varying levels of activeness, demonstrating that video is a key part of a marketing strategy for these organizations.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>There isn\u2019t an ideal number of videos to produce to achieve success, instead focus on the topics covered and how it\u2019s promoted.</p> \n <p>As a reference, the leading ecommerce brands have 120 videos on average with 20,000 views and up, but recognize that each company likely has many more videos on their channels that underperformed.</p> \n <p>Review the total number of videos a brand has on their channel as compared to this average to see that success with videos on YouTube requires learning from failed videos and testing different topics and types of videos.</p> \n <p>For instance, Neiman Marcus has 87 videos on their channel and only seven have generated over 20,000 views or Lowe\u2019s with 889 videos total and only 564 reaching 20,000 views.</p> \n <p>Views aren\u2019t the only metric to indicate the business value of a YouTube video, but they\u2019re a strong indicator of each video\u2019s overall performance.</p> \n <p>The views on a brand\u2019s videos don\u2019t directly correlate with the number of keywords it ranks for. Evaluate the YouTube channels of these brands for insights on what works.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>One indicator of a brand\u2019s success in search are the number of qualified keywords they rank highly for to reach the right people.</p> \n <p>Not all of the keywords a brand ranks for are likely targeted directly by the brand, but a majority are informed by the site\u2019s content and optimization.</p> \n <p>The SEO overview report from SpyFu was used to calculate the total number of unique organic keywords that appear for the 50 brands in the top 50 search results.</p> \n <p>Surprisingly, 60 percent, or 30 out of the 50 brands, reviewed rank for more than 50,000 organic keywords in search.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Use this data to inform your long-term approach to targeting keywords by starting with a small focused list initially and continuing to focus on keywords worth optimizing for.</p> \n <p>Every organization ranks for additional keywords that are connected to what they are specifically focusing on, but use the 50,000 mark as a reference when optimizing.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>There is a vast range in the number of keywords that some of these brand ranks for. Best Buy, Wayfair, Lowe\u2019s, and Overstock rank for more than 500,000 keywords, while companies like Ann Taylor, Kate Spade, and North Face rank for under 20,000 keywords.</p> \n <p>Although the length of time a brand has been active online influences the number of keywords it ranks for, this data provides insight into which brands focus on SEO.</p> \n <p>Most leading ecommerce brands rank for over 50,000 keywords, use this data as a reference when continuing to build your own list.</p> \n <p>The number of keywords a brand ranks for on the first page is a better measure of success than the total number of keywords it ranks for overall.</p> \n <p>SpyFu\u2019s SEO overview report was run to determine the total number of organic keywords that appear for the 50 leading ecommerce brands in the top 10 search results on the first page.</p> \n <p>Of the 50 ecommerce brands analyzed, 64 percent rank for less than 50,000 organic keywords on the first page of a Google search.</p> \n <p>First-page rankings for a particular keyword phrase are more difficult to achieve since there is more competition, which is why brands have far fewer keywords there.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>On average, over the total number of keywords a leading ecommerce brand ranks for, 23 percent rank on the first page of a Google search.</p> \n <p>Remember, there are many factors that impact why an enterprise ranks, such as the authority of the brand, which impacts their pages\u2019 popularity.</p> \n <p>Use the data below to identify which organizations are finding success with their approach to SEO to monitor what optimizations they\u2019re making and the content they\u2019re producing.</p> \n <p>Less than a quarter of a leading ecommerce brand\u2019s keywords rank on page one of Google, use this as a benchmark to analyze the impact of your keyword research.</p> \n <p>Many brands overoptimize their site for SEO by focusing too many pages on the same exact keywords, which is known as keyword cannibalization.</p> \n <p>Regardless of their intentions, this practice leads to diminished search authority for a brand as its own internal pages are competing against one another.</p> \n <p>Instead, an organization should choose a variety of related keywords that demonstrate the range of the company\u2019s expertise.</p> \n <p>Too often, cannibalization occurs by accident as the same metadata, like title tags, meta descriptions, and headers tags gets duplicated across multiple pages.</p> \n <p>The Screaming Frog SEO Spider tool was used to crawl 500 pages of 48 of the top ecommerce brands to identify the prevalence of duplicated metadata.</p> \n <p>Upon review, almost all the 48 brands had widespread duplication of their metadata across their website.</p> \n <p>Unfortunately, 93 percent of analyzed brands have over 100 instances of duplicated URLs, page titles, meta descriptions, meta keywords, and H1 and H2 header tags.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>For example, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. and American Eagle Outfitters each had over 2,500 instances of duplication in their metadata across 500 pages.</p> \n <p>Both brands should audit their website using a crawling tool to see where duplicates exist and make their metadata more distinct on every page.</p> \n <p>Prevent cannibalization of a company\u2019s keywords by running a monthly crawl report to identify what duplicates need to be corrected.</p> \n <p>Honorable Mention: Wayfair, an online home goods retailer, had the fewest instances of duplication across their website as compared to the 47 other reviewed brands.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>As one of the few retailers on this list to operate solely online, it makes sense that Wayfair is performing regular maintenance on their website for SEO and users alike.</p> \n <p>Most ecommerce brands have duplicated metadata on-site, likely affecting their rankings. Regularly audit your site to prevent the same issues from occurring.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>The goal of a title tag is to inform visitors what a particular page is about when they see it listed in SERPs and it is one of the factors the search engines review when ranking a page.</p> \n <p>It\u2019s essential to include relevant keywords within a title tag to accurately describe the content of a page, but it shouldn\u2019t be robotic and solely serve search engines.</p> \n <p>A highly effective title tag provides the necessary information to the search engines, while being an engaging 60 characters or less of text for people actually reading it.</p> \n <p>Narrative title tags include the right keywords but explain the subject of a page to incite action, express a brand\u2019s personality, or inform customers about a product or service.</p> \n <p>Here\u2019s an example of a narrative title tag HSN used for their travel accessories page:</p> \n <p>Travel Gear &amp; Accessories You Can\u2019t Travel Without | HSN</p> \n <p>This title tag includes keywords like travel gear, the brand\u2019s name, and a quirky phrase at the end to showcase the brand\u2019s personality and encourage customers to shop.</p> \n <p>As compared to a more keyword-driven title tag that\u2019s often overly simplified and only includes keywords like this one from Vans used to describe their backpack line:</p> \n <p>Realm Backpack | Shop at Vans</p> \n <p>The ideal scenario is to have a mix of the two types of title tags, but catered more to being narrative as they are better for serving both the search engines and customers.</p> \n <p>Screaming Frog was used to crawl 500 pages from each ecommerce brand to determine any patterns in the way title tags were written on their website.</p> \n <p>Most of the title tags found on the websites of the top ecommerce brands were heavily keyword focused.</p> \n <p>This is the case because it is easier for a company to craft a quick and simple title tag with the right keywords as opposed to taking a creative approach.</p> \n <p>It is surprising how few brands are making their title tags more narrative as every touchpoint across a website is an opportunity to connect a brand with its customers.</p> \n <p>Only 13 of the 50 ecommerce brands are using narrative elements in their title tags, showcasing an opportunity for an organization to stand out from these industry leaders.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Ulta, Neiman Marcus, Sears, and Blue Nile are some of the few companies adding a narrative element to their title tags, review their use of metadata for inspiration on how to account for readers and Google under a 60-character limit.</p> \n <p>Honorable Mention: For crafting narrative title tags, here are examples to learn from. Kate Spade and Victoria\u2019s Secret add colorful adjectives to their title tags to make them more interesting and aligned with their brand, while still catering to search engines.</p> \n <p>Totes \u2013 Smart, Carry-all Tote Bags for Timeless Style | Kate Spade New York</p> \n <p>Very Sexy Platinum For Him Cologne \u2013 Victoria\u2019s Secret</p> \n <p>Lowe\u2019s and Wayfair include verbs to incite action and describe how their offerings make people feel or how to use a product; consider including a relevant call-to-action.</p> \n <p>Queen Mattresses You\u2019ll Love | Wayfair</p> \n <p>Build a Deck-Top Pond \u2013 Lowe\u2019s</p> \n <p>These brands are also purposely including natural and relatable language that\u2019s similar to the way their customers talk, which helps their metadata resonate with readers.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>\u201cBrands need storytelling to captivate an audience whose digital attention is always being fought for. On the other hand, brands similarly need content to be found by search engines and to engage in social media.</p> \n <p>I would expect savvy brands to be optimizing their content for maximum exposure in search using keywords that a consumer might naturally use.</p> \n <p>At the same time, optimizing for the maximum shareability of their content in social media using a combination of hashtags, keywords, and perhaps more narrative title tags to garner interest and emotion.</p> \n <p>The lure to a company\u2019s content, whether it be through title tags and meta descriptions for search engines or customizing the way the content looks when it is shared on each social network, should be optimized for each channel to ensure maximum exposure.\u201d</p> \n <p>Most ecommerce brands fail to move beyond keyword-driven title tags. Instead, include a balance of storytelling and keywords in your title tags and other metadata.</p> \n <p>Writing a single title tag or meta description may seem insignificant, but the combined impact of optimizing all the pages across a website can make a noticeable difference.</p> \n <p>The websites of 48 leading ecommerce companies were crawled using Screaming Frog to determine how many pages from a sampling of 500 were optimized properly for SEO.</p> \n <p>Every ecommerce brand analyzed had a majority of their metadata optimized correctly.</p> \n <p>According to the crawl report, each ecommerce company had at least 80 percent of their site optimized with an accurate title tag, meta description, and H1 and H2 headers.</p> \n <p>Despite most pages being optimized correctly, there were still over 45,000 issues with metadata detected.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Brands most often had issues with their meta descriptions being too long or too short, missing an H2 tag, or their title tags being too brief, which is a missed opportunity to share useful information about the content included on a page.</p> \n <p>Pay attention to these important details as some of these optimizations impact how the search engines rank a website, influence a person\u2019s decision to visit a page or both.</p> \n <p>Keep pace with the leading ecommerce brands by ensuring your website is fully optimized with the proper metadata.</p> \n <p>Too often ecommerce sites showcase their products with only a product name, a duplicated description of the item from the manufacturer, and an image.</p> \n <p>Whether a product or a category page, including original copy is useful for providing information to shoppers and giving the search engines insights about the page.</p> \n <p>To determine any consistent on-page elements found on product pages, the top five most trafficked pages on each site, as reported by Ahrefs, were manually reviewed.</p> \n <p>Upon review, 54 percent of the top 50 ecommerce companies had original copy included on their most visited product and category pages.</p> \n <p>Most of the 27 brands that had copy on their top pages had over 100 words included either at the bottom of a category page or as part of an in-depth product description.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>These are additional elements that consistently appeared on the top performing product pages that likely impacts their performance in search:</p> \n <p></p> \n <p></p> \n <p></p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Expert Reflections:<a href=\"https://rebekahradice.com/\">Rebekah Radice</a>, Founder and CMO of RadiantLA</p> \n <p>\u201cThat data is a strong case for the creation of original content. Unfortunately, this is one of the many challenges companies face. To combat a bandwidth issue, start with a simple search.</p> \n <p>Go to your Google Analytics dashboard and choose, \u201cBehavior -&gt; Site Content -&gt; All Pages.\u201d What you\u2019re looking for is top performing (trafficked) pages. Choose your top five pages based on relevance to your audience, unique pageviews, and bounce rate (the higher the more important to update).</p> \n <p>Now make minor tweaks by looking to the page content and asking if the introduction (first paragraph) explains the true nature of the page? Is the struggle you\u2019re solving for the reader clear? Are your keywords added naturally?</p> \n <p>Your goal is to update the content only as much is necessary to match the actual intent of your audience. The better you can make that connection, the better those top performing pages will convert.\u201d</p> \n <p>Honorable Mention: Gap includes useful copy on some of their category pages to serve both the search engines and its customers, as seen here at the bottom of their baby clothes page.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>The company includes over 300 words of copy on certain category pages that naturally integrate relevant keywords about the focus of the page.</p> \n <p>For their customers, the copy is organized into different sections providing details about the collection, its unique features, and tips on how to style the products effectively.</p> \n <p>Gap should continue this approach and add relevant copy across more of their most important category pages.</p> \n <p>Aim to both provide utility to readers with the copy included on product pages and enough keyword-rich text to provide the right context to the search engines.</p> \n <p>Integrate original copy across every page of a website to drive more traffic and improve the on-site experience for visitors.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Sharing on social media primarily drives awareness and engagement but doesn\u2019t have a direct impact on how a site ranks in search.</p> \n <p>However, the greater visibility social media provides may indirectly bring content to the attention of content creators, editors, site owners, and others who have the ability to feature this content and potentially drive links to the original resource.</p> \n <p>To determine if this correlation exists, 48 of the top ecommerce sites were reviewed using the most shared report from BuzzSumo.</p> \n <p>This report listed the number of links and social shares each page on these websites had earned, which were then organized by the top 40 most shared pages on social media.</p> \n <p>The number of links the top 20 pages had was compared to the total links the next 20 pages had to determine if more social shares coincided with a greater number of links.</p> \n <p>After reviewing this data, it became clear that most of the pages analyzed had more links when they had a higher number of shares on social media.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>For instance, Apple has 12,034 links on their top 20 most shared pages as compared to 7,195 links on the next 20 most shared pages \u2014 a difference of 4,839 links.</p> \n <p>Brands of all sizes should act on this data by developing product pages and content on their website that have elements ideal for sharing on social media.</p> \n <p>Too often, businesses create content, but neglect to come up with a proper distribution plan.</p> \n <p>Consider the many ways of gaining traction on social media like working with influencers, adding visual media, and including original information.</p> \n <p>There is a clear connection between the number of social shares and the backlinks a page earns. Create content that\u2019s social media friendly to indirectly drive links.</p> \n <p>Although an organization can indirectly impact the external links driven to their site, they do have direct control of their own internal links.</p> \n <p>An internal link is a link that points to another page on the same site helping the search engines understand how the site is organized and visitors easily navigate its pages.</p> \n <p>Linking to relevant phrases naturally throughout a website can help search engines better grasp the flow of PageRank and authority.</p> \n <p>The SEMrush site audit statistics report was calculated to determine the percentage of internal links included on 500 pages for 49 of the leading ecommerce brands.</p> \n <p>A majority of the top ecommerce brands analyzed have a reasonable amount of internal links across their sites.</p> \n <p>Thirty-nine out of the top 49 brands had 50+ internal links included on their pages, 38 companies had at least one and 35 companies had between two and five links.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>It is surprising to see that most brands embraced a technical SEO detail like internal linking, which indicates how important this element is to serve customers and Google.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Although the average number of internal links per site varied significantly, most of these links pointed to related products, corresponding category pages, or relevant content.</p> \n <p>Follow in the footsteps of these leading brands and add internal links throughout your website to create a simple navigation structure.</p> \n <p>Don\u2019t overdo it by including too many links on each page for the sake of including them, instead focus on adding links that provide value or assist with organization.</p> \n <p>Honorable Mention: Office Depot is an example of a brand with the optimal balance of internal links across their website.</p> \n <p>About half of their pages have 50+ internal links and the other half only have one internal link per page, while the rest of their site has two to 50 links across each page.</p> \n <p>This is a balanced approach as some pages shouldn\u2019t include too many links to ensure a visitor takes action, while others should include lots of links to provide options.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>When reviewing the links included on your website, ensure there are a diverse mix of quality internal links to match the different types of pages.</p> \n <p>For example, a blog post might include eight to 14 links to related content and products, while a product page only has four internal links included to recommended products.</p> \n <p>Brands should include a variety of quality internal links across their websites to help create a simple navigation structure for both visitors and search engines.</p> \n <p>Toxic links are spam links that are harmful to the credibility of a website in search. It is important for any ecommerce site to monitor the quality of their backlink profile to ensure they are able to flag toxic links for removal.</p> \n <p>The SEMrush backlink audit identified the number of toxic links each of the top 50 ecommerce websites had and then was compared to the site\u2019s number of organic keywords and estimated average monthly organic traffic as calculated by SpyFu.</p> \n <p>This test proved that there isn\u2019t a clear negative or positive correlation between the number of toxic links to organic keywords and monthly traffic.</p> \n <p>Some brands had a higher number of keywords and traffic even with a high percentage of toxic links, while others had the opposite arrangement.</p> \n <p>The test did reveal a potential impact of toxic links like how six of the top 10 sites with the highest percentage of toxic links ranked for less than 50,000 keywords.</p> \n <p>It\u2019s unclear if the presence of toxic links was the only cause for these lower number of organic keywords, but it\u2019s important to recognize that it may have been a factor.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>The brands with the highest amount of toxic links are Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods with 48,000 toxic links and North Face with nearly 26 percent of all their links identified as toxic.</p> \n <p>These organizations should audit their website to crawl all their existing links and begin manually identifying which are toxic and should be immediately disavowed.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>As a benchmark for how many bad links are common to have on a site, recognize that 74 percent of the leading ecommerce brands have link profiles that are less than 2 percent toxic.</p> \n <p>The other 26 percent of leading ecommerce brands had link profiles that were over 2 percent toxic, highlighting how prevalent the problem can become if not addressed properly.</p> \n <p>Every website has toxic links, but they mostly make up a small percentage of a site\u2019s total links. Run an analysis quarterly to identify which links need to be removed.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>According to Google, the <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/\">average time it takes</a> to fully load a mobile landing page is 22 seconds.</p> \n <p>A visitor\u2019s tolerance for a slow loading website on any device is low and Google takes a site\u2019s load time into consideration when ranking its pages.</p> \n <p>Both Pingdom and Google\u2019s Mobile Speed Test were used to determine the load time for 48 leading ecommerce brands on desktop and mobile.</p> \n <p>According to the analysis of the ecommerce leaders, their average mobile load time is 9.52 seconds and the average desktop load time is 2.94 seconds, faster than the industry average.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Most organizations from this analysis optimized their sites effectively, but others still must fix a range of issues to reduce load time to a reasonable length.</p> \n <p>The leading ecommerce brands lose an average of 26 percent of their visitors due to slow mobile page speeds, which can result in a significant loss of revenue.</p> \n <p>Neglecting to decrease mobile load times will continue to diminish the number of conversions a site drives in the long term as more transaction occur on devices.</p> \n <p>Use Pingdom or Google\u2019s Mobile Speed Test to determine your site\u2019s load time and to identify areas in need of improvement like page size, the number of redirects, and more.</p> \n <p>Honorable Mention: Nike had the best overall load time out of the 50 brands reviewed with a load time on desktop of 1.27 seconds and six seconds on mobile.</p> \n <p>Faster is better. Decrease the load time across devices below three seconds for the best customer experience and to slightly impact the search rankings.</p> \n <p>Large enterprise ecommerce sites use faceted navigation to make it easy for visitors to sort through options on a page like filtering a sweaters page by size, brand, or color.</p> \n <p>Faceted navigation makes it easier for customers to find the products they\u2019re looking for, which often means they\u2019re more likely to convert.</p> \n <p>Businesses fail to properly tag the navigation structure on their site leading to the search engines ranking multiple versions of the same pages.</p> \n <p>There are a few ways to alert the search engines as to how to crawl and index existing pages correctly like adding a noindex tag, adding canonical tags to identify which version of a series of pages deserves credit, disavowing sections of the site with the robots.txt, or by nofollowing all internal links that shouldn\u2019t be crawled.</p> \n <p>Each approach has pros and cons, <a href=\"https://moz.com/blog/large-site-seo-basics-faceted-navigation\">as analyzed on Moz\u2019s blog</a>, but there isn\u2019t one ideal solution other than initially building the navigation with the right JavaScript.</p> \n <p>Screaming Frog was used to crawl 500 pages of each site to determine which ecommerce brands are optimizing their faceted navigation with the right SEO tags.</p> \n <p>Most of the ecommerce brands analyzed did have these SEO tags on some of the pages on their websites.</p> \n <p>The use of these tags on certain pages may not have been for correcting issues with navigation, but without direct access to the site, we cannot be sure.</p> \n <p>Most of the leading ecommerce brands embrace the use of these SEO tags to ensure that the navigation for customers isn\u2019t negatively impacting their search rankings.</p> \n <p>When correcting issues with navigation on a website, add the appropriate SEO tags to alert Google to which pages to consider and which to ignore.</p> \n <p><a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/google-emails-warnings-webmasters-chrome-will-mark-http-pages-forms-not-secure-280907\">Google recently announced</a> that it will begin showing \u201cnot secure\u201d warnings in Chrome for any websites that allow a user to enter data on an HTTP page.</p> \n <p>Eventually, Google plans to show this warning for all HTTP pages on a site.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Providing security for visitors should be a key priority for an ecommerce site as customers need to trust that their private information will be kept safe.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>These warnings from Chrome and any hesitation a visitor might have shopping on a website can greatly decrease a site\u2019s conversion rate.</p> \n <p>Each of the 50 leading ecommerce websites were manually reviewed to see if they were secured with HTTPS or not.</p> \n <p>Most top ecommerce brands are using HTTPS to secure their entire website against misuse and to integrate more effectively with Chrome and tech that requires it.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Despite most organizations working to keep their sites secure, major brands like Carter\u2019s, Gap, Ralph Lauren, Ulta, Neiman Marcus, and others don\u2019t have HTTPS across their entire website, leaving customers at risk and reducing their conversion rates in the process.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Expert Reflections:<a href=\"http://www.aaronagius.com/\">Aaron Agius</a>, Co-Founder and Managing Director at Louder.Online</p> \n <p>\u201cI wish I could say I\u2019m surprised that sites (even industry leaders) aren\u2019t moving to HTTPS, given the benefits of doing so. It isn\u2019t just the upcoming addition of the \u2018Not Secure\u2019 notification in Chrome.</p> \n <p>Google has made it clear for some time that they\u2019re counting HTTPS as a ranking signal and indexing secure pages over unsecured ones.</p> \n <p>But making the move isn\u2019t as simple as installing a security certificate and calling it a day. Going to HTTPS requires changing internal links, adding the proper canonical links to your &lt;head&gt; section, making sure your CDN is HTTPS compatible and much more.</p> \n <p>Every step introduces potential complications; large sites are especially at risk, given their sheer number of moving parts. Errors in the process can lead to major crawling issues, duplicate content, and UX problems, which is why it\u2019s a good idea to work with an SEO professional who\u2019s familiar with HTTPS migrations \u2014 no matter what size your company is.\u201d</p> \n <p>Upgrade to HTTPS to encrypt sensitive data sent across a website and properly integrate with Chrome and other technology to protect visitors and maintain their trust.</p> \n <p>Understanding the consistent challenges ecommerce leaders face with SEO can help prioritize what issues your organization should look out for.</p> \n <p>The Varvy SEO tool was used to review 44 of the most prevalent ecommerce retailers to identify the presence of a sitemap, valid HTML, image alt text, and other SEO issues.</p> \n <p>Reviewing each of the 44 sites illustrated that leading ecommerce firms are dealing with an average of five major SEO-related issues.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>The most prominent issues these companies had across their websites were:</p> \n <p>The brands that were the most SEO friendly with only two issues detected were:</p> \n <p>Improving a website is an ongoing process that even top ecommerce brands need to continually work at.

services now.</p> \n <p>Google Home and Alexa are the two leading voice assistants that are competing aggressively to dominate the growing voice search industry.</p> \n <p>Brands can create customized experiences by developing an Alexa Skill or a Google Action to seamlessly integrate their own apps and offerings with these services.</p> \n <p>Beyond ranking organically for voice search, an integration at this level can help a brand better connect with consumers using these platforms.</p> \n <p>Both the marketplace for Alexa Skills and Google Actions was manually reviewed to determine which ecommerce brands have built integrations on these platforms.</p> \n <p>After reviewing the 50 leading ecommerce brands, a vast majority of these organizations don\u2019t have any integrations with Alexa or Google Home.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>The lack of major ecommerce brands developing integrations with these services presents an opportunity for your enterprise to start experimenting with these platforms.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Known as the first-mover advantage, by getting active and achieving success on a particular platform, in this case Alexa and/or Google Home, allows an organization to have a competitive edge before a network becomes oversaturated.</p> \n <p>Honorable Mention: Lowe\u2019s and Best Buy were the only brands with integrations on both Alexa and Google

customers as this technology continues to grow in popularity.</p> \n <p>At least 50 percent of <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/data-google-monthly-search-volume-dwarfs-rivals-mobile-advantage-269120\">Google\u2019s global search queries</a> are now from mobile devices, which should act as a reminder as to why it\u2019s essential to optimize for mobile search.</p> \n <p>Varvy\u2019s Mobile SEO tool was used to review 43 of these top retailers to identify the common optimizations made and the frequent issues these organizations faced.</p> \n <p>The most common mobile SEO challenges experienced by these brands were:</p> \n <p>According to Varvy, the tap targets across these sites weren\u2019t large enough as the mobile screen is small and needs big buttons for people to easily navigate by tapping.</p> \n <p>The rest of the common issues were speed-related errors as every brand had problems with browser caching and almost every site had render blocking CSS or JavaScript that slowed down the page load time.</p> \n <p>Most of the analyzed brands made the following optimizations for an optimal mobile experience:</p> \n <p>Pay attention to load time and the usability of a mobile site to help customers navigate the shopping experience and search engines accurately crawl it.</p> \n <p>Schema is code that can be added to any website to better inform the search engines about how to serve the site\u2019s content in the search results.</p> \n <p>Whether a site\u2019s pages showcase recipes, reviews, or music, adding schema will help the search engines understand the relevancy of a page as related to a search query.</p> \n <p>Consumers benefit, too, as the results for a page that\u2019s been marked up with structured data will more accurately reflect the type of information the site offers.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>For example, this recipe for True Texas Chili on Epicurious has been marked up as a recipe to appear in search with an image, ratings, reviews, and calorie count.</p> \n <p>The SEMrush Site Audit tool was used to crawl 500 pages from each of the 49 most successful ecommerce sites to determine how prominent the use of schema markup is, as well as open graph, Twitter cards, and microformats.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>A majority of the analyzed companies, 31 out of 49, use schema on at least 1 percent of their pages.</p> \n <p>Here\u2019s the breakdown of the frequency of schema markup used across the pages on these websites.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>It\u2019s clear that adding schema is widely adopted by top ecommerce sites, but most could certainly improve in terms of adding it to a larger percentage of their pages.</p> \n <p>The reason schema isn\u2019t more widely adopted across a larger portion of pages on many sites is because the process of adding markup can be time consuming.</p> \n <p>To best approach adding schema to your site, start small by first adding markup to the most important pages based on the sales, conversions, or traffic.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>In terms of the other types of markup used, Open Graph from Facebook is the most widely used, since the social network is a prevalent marketing medium.</p> \n <p>Start by adding schema and other relevant types of markup language to the most important pages to best present your site\u2019s content.</p> \n <p>Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) allow brands to load their pages quickly on mobile devices directly from Google search results.</p> \n <p>Available for any website to use for free, AMP pages load instantly, provide smooth scrolling, keep a page\u2019s existing styling and branding, and offer the ability to monetize ads.</p> \n <p><a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/google-releases-variety-accelerated-mobile-pages-project-amp-updates-scrolling-animations-video-analytics-fluid-ad-support-283776\">According to Google</a>, these pages load roughly four times faster and use one-tenth the data of pages and objects not built in AMP.</p> \n <p>A major benefit is that Google gives AMP pages priority in mobile search because it offers a better experience for users. AMP isn\u2019t a ranking signal but more of a preferred format by Google.</p> \n <p>The first three pages of mobile search results were reviewed manually and a 500-page crawl of each site was completed to detect the use of AMP by the top 49 ecommerce companies.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Only three of the 49 reviewed companies, Overstock, JCrew, and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, were using AMP on their website.</p> \n <p>This lack of AMP adoption for the moment is an opportunity for your organization to turn on AMP across relevant pages and stand out in search for the right reasons.</p> \n <p>Honorable Mention: While manually reviewing the mobile search results of these brands, it was surprising to see how often AMP pages would appear for these companies via Retale.</p> \n <p>A mobile deals and discounts app, Retale is the online version of a printed flyer showcasing current offers and coupons from a range of retailers.</p> \n <p>It appears that Retale also creates local listing pages for many of these brands with AMP to ensure their retail location\u2019s address, phone number, store hours, and weekly offers are featured prominently in Google search.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p></p> \n <p>It\u2019s unclear if Retale charges retailers for creating AMP pages for their local stores, but since this feature is free, it\u2019d be easy for these brands to implement them on their own site.</p> \n <p>These brands would likely earn more of the benefits of AMP by adding it on their website as compared to having their local listings managed by a third party.</p> \n <p>Implement AMP on your company\u2019s site to provide a seamless, fast experience for customers searching on mobile and to prioritize your pages and content in search.</p> \n <p>Combine these insights from the top 50 ecommerce brands with an ongoing audit of your site\u2019s progress to achieve success with search.</p> \n <p>Analyze where your organization stands on a quarterly basis and refer back to this data to evaluate how these ecommerce companies are approaching the same challenges.</p> \n <p>When evaluating this data, don\u2019t duplicate what the leading brands are doing exactly, but instead, apply the lessons learned to your company\u2019s unique circumstances.</p> \n <p>After analyzing these findings, it\u2019s time to take action and begin making the necessary optimizations to correct any errors and start experimenting to test new opportunities.</p> \n <p>Being more informed about the progress of industry leaders, changing technology, and evolving consumer needs will enable an enterprise to succeed with SEO.</p> \n</div>",
        "text": "Being discovered in search is one of the primary ways leading ecommerce brands generate traffic to their websites from new and returning customers alike. Though direct traffic generates 40 percent of an ecommerce site\u2019s referral traffic, search follows close behind with 34 percent of the total traffic driven, according to Smart Insights. Even though search plays an important role in bringing customers to an ecommerce site, it\u2019s difficult for even the big brands to dedicate enough time and resources to search. So, the goal of this study was to showcase where companies should prioritize their time when optimizing for search based on the approaches of leading ecommerce brands. Beyond addressing the foundational SEO tactics worth pursuing, a range of new opportunities are also explored in the study to give any organization a first-mover advantage against competitors. Here are some key takeaways from the study: The data for this research study was generated by reviewing the top 50 ecommerce retailers in the United States. These companies were chosen from listings compiled by the National Retail Federation and Women\u2019s Wear Daily, both based on online sales. Across these companies, 12 different industries are represented including apparel, beauty, department store, electronics, footwear, home goods, home improvement, jewelry, office supplies, pharmacy, retail, and sporting goods. The organizations reviewed were Abercrombie & Fitch Co., Amazon, American Eagle Outfitters, Ann Taylor, Apple, Bath & Body Works, Best Buy, Blue Nile, Cabela\u2019s, Carter\u2019s, Costco, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Dillard\u2019s, Express, Finish Line, Foot Locker, GAP, Home Depot, HSN, J.C. Penney, J.Crew, Kate Spade, Kohl\u2019s, L.L. Bean, Lands\u2019 End, Lowe\u2019s, Macy\u2019s, Neiman Marcus, NIKE, Nordstrom, Office Depot, Overstock, QVC, Ralph Lauren, Sears, Staples, Target, The North Face, Tiffany & Co., Timberland, Ulta, Under Armour, Urban Outfitters, Vans, Victoria\u2019s Secret, Wal-Mart, Walgreens, Wayfair, Williams-Sonoma, and Zulily. These leading brands were analyzed across 19 tests to review both the optimizations driving results as well as the challenges they face reaching their goals with search. In addition to manually reviewing certain elements across each company, these tests were completed using BuzzSumo, SEMrush, Ahrefs, SpyFu, ScreamingFrog SEO Spider, Pingdom Website Speed Test, and Varvy SEO tool. For some of the completed tests, not all of the 50 brands were able to be analyzed as some tools were blocked from crawling certain websites. Blogging certainly has many benefits, but there has always been a debate as to what the ideal publishing frequency an organization should aim for. Each of the 50 websites were manually reviewed to determine the average number of blog posts they\u2019ve published over the last eight months from January 2017 to August 2017. SpyFu was used to calculate the total number of organic keywords each organization ranked for and SEMrush to identify the total number of backlinks each site has. From our analysis, there isn\u2019t a clear correlation between an increase or decrease in links or organic keywords and how frequently a brand publishes a blog. Links and keywords increased with more blog posts published in some instances and the opposite was true as well for other companies on the list. From the data collected about these brands, it\u2019s fair to say that the quantity of content published doesn\u2019t have a definitive impact on an organization\u2019s SEO. Despite the results of this test, creating content is still a valuable way to drive SEO value as it\u2019s a viable means of attracting links, engagement, and loyalty from customers. While reviewing each brand, especially in the apparel category, it\u2019s clear that operating a blog is an important channel for communicating with customers as: Among the reviewed brands, the use of their blogs differed from sharing product updates, styling tips, news about their company and events, interviews with influential voices, and more. Most of these organizations have their blog hosted on their own websites, which is the ideal arrangement to reap the SEO benefits from regularly sharing content. Unfortunately, Victoria\u2019s Secret, Abercrombie, and a few others are only using Tumblr to blog, which certainly has advantages, but doesn\u2019t deliver the full SEO benefits. Instead, those brands should blog on both Tumblr and their own website like Nordstrom does or integrate their existing Tumblr onto their domain like Walgreens did with tumblr.walgreens.com. The number of blogs published doesn\u2019t have a clear impact on SEO. Although, most leading ecommerce brands are blogging to earn the activity\u2019s many benefits. There is no doubt that YouTube videos rank in Google search, but not all videos rank because many factors are considered as to whether a video is listed in the search results or not. One factor that increases the likelihood of a video ranking in YouTube or Google is if it\u2019s actually being watched, which is an indicator of quality and relevancy. Each of the brand\u2019s YouTube channels was manually reviewed to determine the number of videos with 20,000 views or more to be compared against the current number of organic keywords each company ranks for. There doesn\u2019t appear to be a positive or negative correlation between the number of quality YouTube videos a brand produces and the keywords they rank for. For example, reviewing this data illustrated that some brands that rank for over 100,000 keywords had zero videos over 20,000 views, while others had 152 videos. Every brand has a YouTube channel at varying levels of activeness, demonstrating that video is a key part of a marketing strategy for these organizations. There isn\u2019t an ideal number of videos to produce to achieve success, instead focus on the topics covered and how it\u2019s promoted. As a reference, the leading ecommerce brands have 120 videos on average with 20,000 views and up, but recognize that each company likely has many more videos on their channels that underperformed. Review the total number of videos a brand has on their channel as compared to this average to see that success with videos on YouTube requires learning from failed videos and testing different topics and types of videos. For instance, Neiman Marcus has 87 videos on their channel and only seven have generated over 20,000 views or Lowe\u2019s with 889 videos total and only 564 reaching 20,000 views. Views aren\u2019t the only metric to indicate the business value of a YouTube video, but they\u2019re a strong indicator of each video\u2019s overall performance. The views on a brand\u2019s videos don\u2019t directly correlate with the number of keywords it ranks for. Evaluate the YouTube channels of these brands for insights on what works. One indicator of a brand\u2019s success in search are the number of qualified keywords they rank highly for to reach the right people. Not all of the keywords a brand ranks for are likely targeted directly by the brand, but a majority are informed by the site\u2019s content and optimization. The SEO overview report from SpyFu was used to calculate the total number of unique organic keywords that appear for the 50 brands in the top 50 search results. Surprisingly, 60 percent, or 30 out of the 50 brands, reviewed rank for more than 50,000 organic keywords in search. Use this data to inform your long-term approach to targeting keywords by starting with a small focused list initially and continuing to focus on keywords worth optimizing for. Every organization ranks for additional keywords that are connected to what they are specifically focusing on, but use the 50,000 mark as a reference when optimizing. There is a vast range in the number of keywords that some of these brand ranks for. Best Buy, Wayfair, Lowe\u2019s, and Overstock rank for more than 500,000 keywords, while companies like Ann Taylor, Kate Spade, and North Face rank for under 20,000 keywords. Although the length of time a brand has been active online influences the number of keywords it ranks for, this data provides insight into which brands focus on SEO. Most leading ecommerce brands rank for over 50,000 keywords, use this data as a reference when continuing to build your own list. The number of keywords a brand ranks for on the first page is a better measure of success than the total number of keywords it ranks for overall. SpyFu\u2019s SEO overview report was run to determine the total number of organic keywords that appear for the 50 leading ecommerce brands in the top 10 search results on the first page. Of the 50 ecommerce brands analyzed, 64 percent rank for less than 50,000 organic keywords on the first page of a Google search. First-page rankings for a particular keyword phrase are more difficult to achieve since there is more competition, which is why brands have far fewer keywords there. On average, over the total number of keywords a leading ecommerce brand ranks for, 23 percent rank on the first page of a Google search. Remember, there are many factors that impact why an enterprise ranks, such as the authority of the brand, which impacts their pages\u2019 popularity. Use the data below to identify which organizations are finding success with their approach to SEO to monitor what optimizations they\u2019re making and the content they\u2019re producing. Less than a quarter of a leading ecommerce brand\u2019s keywords rank on page one of Google, use this as a benchmark to analyze the impact of your keyword research. Many brands overoptimize their site for SEO by focusing too many pages on the same exact keywords, which is known as keyword cannibalization. Regardless of their intentions, this practice leads to diminished search authority for a brand as its own internal pages are competing against one another. Instead, an organization should choose a variety of related keywords that demonstrate the range of the company\u2019s expertise. Too often, cannibalization occurs by accident as the same metadata, like title tags, meta descriptions, and headers tags gets duplicated across multiple pages. The Screaming Frog SEO Spider tool was used to crawl 500 pages of 48 of the top ecommerce brands to identify the prevalence of duplicated metadata. Upon review, almost all the 48 brands had widespread duplication of their metadata across their website. Unfortunately, 93 percent of analyzed brands have over 100 instances of duplicated URLs, page titles, meta descriptions, meta keywords, and H1 and H2 header tags. For example, Abercrombie & Fitch Co. and American Eagle Outfitters each had over 2,500 instances of duplication in their metadata across 500 pages. Both brands should audit their website using a crawling tool to see where duplicates exist and make their metadata more distinct on every page. Prevent cannibalization of a company\u2019s keywords by running a monthly crawl report to identify what duplicates need to be corrected. Honorable Mention: Wayfair, an online home goods retailer, had the fewest instances of duplication across their website as compared to the 47 other reviewed brands. As one of the few retailers on this list to operate solely online, it makes sense that Wayfair is performing regular maintenance on their website for SEO and users alike. Most ecommerce brands have duplicated metadata on-site, likely affecting their rankings. Regularly audit your site to prevent the same issues from occurring. The goal of a title tag is to inform visitors what a particular page is about when they see it listed in SERPs and it is one of the factors the search engines review when ranking a page. It\u2019s essential to include relevant keywords within a title tag to accurately describe the content of a page, but it shouldn\u2019t be robotic and solely serve search engines. A highly effective title tag provides the necessary information to the search engines, while being an engaging 60 characters or less of text for people actually reading it. Narrative title tags include the right keywords but explain the subject of a page to incite action, express a brand\u2019s personality, or inform customers about a product or service. Here\u2019s an example of a narrative title tag HSN used for their travel accessories page: Travel Gear & Accessories You Can\u2019t Travel Without | HSN This title tag includes keywords like travel gear, the brand\u2019s name, and a quirky phrase at the end to showcase the brand\u2019s personality and encourage customers to shop. As compared to a more keyword-driven title tag that\u2019s often overly simplified and only includes keywords like this one from Vans used to describe their backpack line: Realm Backpack | Shop at Vans The ideal scenario is to have a mix of the two types of title tags, but catered more to being narrative as they are better for serving both the search engines and customers. Screaming Frog was used to crawl 500 pages from each ecommerce brand to determine any patterns in the way title tags were written on their website. Most of the title tags found on the websites of the top ecommerce brands were heavily keyword focused. This is the case because it is easier for a company to craft a quick and simple title tag with the right keywords as opposed to taking a creative approach. It is surprising how few brands are making their title tags more narrative as every touchpoint across a website is an opportunity to connect a brand with its customers. Only 13 of the 50 ecommerce brands are using narrative elements in their title tags, showcasing an opportunity for an organization to stand out from these industry leaders. Ulta, Neiman Marcus, Sears, and Blue Nile are some of the few companies adding a narrative element to their title tags, review their use of metadata for inspiration on how to account for readers and Google under a 60-character limit. Honorable Mention: For crafting narrative title tags, here are examples to learn from. Kate Spade and Victoria\u2019s Secret add colorful adjectives to their title tags to make them more interesting and aligned with their brand, while still catering to search engines. Totes \u2013 Smart, Carry-all Tote Bags for Timeless Style | Kate Spade New York Very Sexy Platinum For Him Cologne \u2013 Victoria\u2019s Secret Lowe\u2019s and Wayfair include verbs to incite action and describe how their offerings make people feel or how to use a product; consider including a relevant call-to-action. Queen Mattresses You\u2019ll Love | Wayfair Build a Deck-Top Pond \u2013 Lowe\u2019s These brands are also purposely including natural and relatable language that\u2019s similar to the way their customers talk, which helps their metadata resonate with readers. \u201cBrands need storytelling to captivate an audience whose digital attention is always being fought for. On the other hand, brands similarly need content to be found by search engines and to engage in social media. I would expect savvy brands to be optimizing their content for maximum exposure in search using keywords that a consumer might naturally use. At the same time, optimizing for the maximum shareability of their content in social media using a combination of hashtags, keywords, and perhaps more narrative title tags to garner interest and emotion. The lure to a company\u2019s content, whether it be through title tags and meta descriptions for search engines or customizing the way the content looks when it is shared on each social network, should be optimized for each channel to ensure maximum exposure.\u201d Most ecommerce brands fail to move beyond keyword-driven title tags. Instead, include a balance of storytelling and keywords in your title tags and other metadata. Writing a single title tag or meta description may seem insignificant, but the combined impact of optimizing all the pages across a website can make a noticeable difference. The websites of 48 leading ecommerce companies were crawled using Screaming Frog to determine how many pages from a sampling of 500 were optimized properly for SEO. Every ecommerce brand analyzed had a majority of their metadata optimized correctly. According to the crawl report, each ecommerce company had at least 80 percent of their site optimized with an accurate title tag, meta description, and H1 and H2 headers. Despite most pages being optimized correctly, there were still over 45,000 issues with metadata detected. Brands most often had issues with their meta descriptions being too long or too short, missing an H2 tag, or their title tags being too brief, which is a missed opportunity to share useful information about the content included on a page. Pay attention to these important details as some of these optimizations impact how the search engines rank a website, influence a person\u2019s decision to visit a page or both. Keep pace with the leading ecommerce brands by ensuring your website is fully optimized with the proper metadata. Too often ecommerce sites showcase their products with only a product name, a duplicated description of the item from the manufacturer, and an image. Whether a product or a category page, including original copy is useful for providing information to shoppers and giving the search engines insights about the page. To determine any consistent on-page elements found on product pages, the top five most trafficked pages on each site, as reported by Ahrefs, were manually reviewed. Upon review, 54 percent of the top 50 ecommerce companies had original copy included on their most visited product and category pages. Most of the 27 brands that had copy on their top pages had over 100 words included either at the bottom of a category page or as part of an in-depth product description. These are additional elements that consistently appeared on the top performing product pages that likely impacts their performance in search: Expert Reflections:Rebekah Radice, Founder and CMO of RadiantLA \u201cThat data is a strong case for the creation of original content. Unfortunately, this is one of the many challenges companies face. To combat a bandwidth issue, start with a simple search. Go to your Google Analytics dashboard and choose, \u201cBehavior -> Site Content -> All Pages.\u201d What you\u2019re looking for is top performing (trafficked) pages. Choose your top five pages based on relevance to your audience, unique pageviews, and bounce rate (the higher the more important to update). Now make minor tweaks by looking to the page content and asking if the introduction (first paragraph) explains the true nature of the page? Is the struggle you\u2019re solving for the reader clear? Are your keywords added naturally? Your goal is to update the content only as much is necessary to match the actual intent of your audience. The better you can make that connection, the better those top performing pages will convert.\u201d Honorable Mention: Gap includes useful copy on some of their category pages to serve both the search engines and its customers, as seen here at the bottom of their baby clothes page. The company includes over 300 words of copy on certain category pages that naturally integrate relevant keywords about the focus of the page. For their customers, the copy is organized into different sections providing details about the collection, its unique features, and tips on how to style the products effectively. Gap should continue this approach and add relevant copy across more of their most important category pages. Aim to both provide utility to readers with the copy included on product pages and enough keyword-rich text to provide the right context to the search engines. Integrate original copy across every page of a website to drive more traffic and improve the on-site experience for visitors. Sharing on social media primarily drives awareness and engagement but doesn\u2019t have a direct impact on how a site ranks in search. However, the greater visibility social media provides may indirectly bring content to the attention of content creators, editors, site owners, and others who have the ability to feature this content and potentially drive links to the original resource. To determine if this correlation exists, 48 of the top ecommerce sites were reviewed using the most shared report from BuzzSumo. This report listed the number of links and social shares each page on these websites had earned, which were then organized by the top 40 most shared pages on social media. The number of links the top 20 pages had was compared to the total links the next 20 pages had to determine if more social shares coincided with a greater number of links. After reviewing this data, it became clear that most of the pages analyzed had more links when they had a higher number of shares on social media. For instance, Apple has 12,034 links on their top 20 most shared pages as compared to 7,195 links on the next 20 most shared pages \u2014 a difference of 4,839 links. Brands of all sizes should act on this data by developing product pages and content on their website that have elements ideal for sharing on social media. Too often, businesses create content, but neglect to come up with a proper distribution plan. Consider the many ways of gaining traction on social media like working with influencers, adding visual media, and including original information. There is a clear connection between the number of social shares and the backlinks a page earns. Create content that\u2019s social media friendly to indirectly drive links. Although an organization can indirectly impact the external links driven to their site, they do have direct control of their own internal links. An internal link is a link that points to another page on the same site helping the search engines understand how the site is organized and visitors easily navigate its pages. Linking to relevant phrases naturally throughout a website can help search engines better grasp the flow of PageRank and authority. The SEMrush site audit statistics report was calculated to determine the percentage of internal links included on 500 pages for 49 of the leading ecommerce brands. A majority of the top ecommerce brands analyzed have a reasonable amount of internal links across their sites. Thirty-nine out of the top 49 brands had 50+ internal links included on their pages, 38 companies had at least one and 35 companies had between two and five links. It is surprising to see that most brands embraced a technical SEO detail like internal linking, which indicates how important this element is to serve customers and Google. Although the average number of internal links per site varied significantly, most of these links pointed to related products, corresponding category pages, or relevant content. Follow in the footsteps of these leading brands and add internal links throughout your website to create a simple navigation structure. Don\u2019t overdo it by including too many links on each page for the sake of including them, instead focus on adding links that provide value or assist with organization. Honorable Mention: Office Depot is an example of a brand with the optimal balance of internal links across their website. About half of their pages have 50+ internal links and the other half only have one internal link per page, while the rest of their site has two to 50 links across each page. This is a balanced approach as some pages shouldn\u2019t include too many links to ensure a visitor takes action, while others should include lots of links to provide options. When reviewing the links included on your website, ensure there are a diverse mix of quality internal links to match the different types of pages. For example, a blog post might include eight to 14 links to related content and products, while a product page only has four internal links included to recommended products. Brands should include a variety of quality internal links across their websites to help create a simple navigation structure for both visitors and search engines. Toxic links are spam links that are harmful to the credibility of a website in search. It is important for any ecommerce site to monitor the quality of their backlink profile to ensure they are able to flag toxic links for removal. The SEMrush backlink audit identified the number of toxic links each of the top 50 ecommerce websites had and then was compared to the site\u2019s number of organic keywords and estimated average monthly organic traffic as calculated by SpyFu. This test proved that there isn\u2019t a clear negative or positive correlation between the number of toxic links to organic keywords and monthly traffic. Some brands had a higher number of keywords and traffic even with a high percentage of toxic links, while others had the opposite arrangement. The test did reveal a potential impact of toxic links like how six of the top 10 sites with the highest percentage of toxic links ranked for less than 50,000 keywords. It\u2019s unclear if the presence of toxic links was the only cause for these lower number of organic keywords, but it\u2019s important to recognize that it may have been a factor. The brands with the highest amount of toxic links are Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods with 48,000 toxic links and North Face with nearly 26 percent of all their links identified as toxic. These organizations should audit their website to crawl all their existing links and begin manually identifying which are toxic and should be immediately disavowed. As a benchmark for how many bad links are common to have on a site, recognize that 74 percent of the leading ecommerce brands have link profiles that are less than 2 percent toxic. The other 26 percent of leading ecommerce brands had link profiles that were over 2 percent toxic, highlighting how prevalent the problem can become if not addressed properly. Every website has toxic links, but they mostly make up a small percentage of a site\u2019s total links. Run an analysis quarterly to identify which links need to be removed. According to Google, the average time it takes to fully load a mobile landing page is 22 seconds. A visitor\u2019s tolerance for a slow loading website on any device is low and Google takes a site\u2019s load time into consideration when ranking its pages. Both Pingdom and Google\u2019s Mobile Speed Test were used to determine the load time for 48 leading ecommerce brands on desktop and mobile. According to the analysis of the ecommerce leaders, their average mobile load time is 9.52 seconds and the average desktop load time is 2.94 seconds, faster than the industry average. Most organizations from this analysis optimized their sites effectively, but others still must fix a range of issues to reduce load time to a reasonable length. The leading ecommerce brands lose an average of 26 percent of their visitors due to slow mobile page speeds, which can result in a significant loss of revenue. Neglecting to decrease mobile load times will continue to diminish the number of conversions a site drives in the long term as more transaction occur on devices. Use Pingdom or Google\u2019s Mobile Speed Test to determine your site\u2019s load time and to identify areas in need of improvement like page size, the number of redirects, and more. Honorable Mention: Nike had the best overall load time out of the 50 brands reviewed with a load time on desktop of 1.27 seconds and six seconds on mobile. Faster is better. Decrease the load time across devices below three seconds for the best customer experience and to slightly impact the search rankings. Large enterprise ecommerce sites use faceted navigation to make it easy for visitors to sort through options on a page like filtering a sweaters page by size, brand, or color. Faceted navigation makes it easier for customers to find the products they\u2019re looking for, which often means they\u2019re more likely to convert. Businesses fail to properly tag the navigation structure on their site leading to the search engines ranking multiple versions of the same pages. There are a few ways to alert the search engines as to how to crawl and index existing pages correctly like adding a noindex tag, adding canonical tags to identify which version of a series of pages deserves credit, disavowing sections of the site with the robots.txt, or by nofollowing all internal links that shouldn\u2019t be crawled. Each approach has pros and cons, as analyzed on Moz\u2019s blog, but there isn\u2019t one ideal solution other than initially building the navigation with the right JavaScript. Screaming Frog was used to crawl 500 pages of each site to determine which ecommerce brands are optimizing their faceted navigation with the right SEO tags. Most of the ecommerce brands analyzed did have these SEO tags on some of the pages on their websites. The use of these tags on certain pages may not have been for correcting issues with navigation, but without direct access to the site, we cannot be sure. Most of the leading ecommerce brands embrace the use of these SEO tags to ensure that the navigation for customers isn\u2019t negatively impacting their search rankings. When correcting issues with navigation on a website, add the appropriate SEO tags to alert Google to which pages to consider and which to ignore. Google recently announced that it will begin showing \u201cnot secure\u201d warnings in Chrome for any websites that allow a user to enter data on an HTTP page. Eventually, Google plans to show this warning for all HTTP pages on a site. Providing security for visitors should be a key priority for an ecommerce site as customers need to trust that their private information will be kept safe. These warnings from Chrome and any hesitation a visitor might have shopping on a website can greatly decrease a site\u2019s conversion rate. Each of the 50 leading ecommerce websites were manually reviewed to see if they were secured with HTTPS or not. Most top ecommerce brands are using HTTPS to secure their entire website against misuse and to integrate more effectively with Chrome and tech that requires it. Despite most organizations working to keep their sites secure, major brands like Carter\u2019s, Gap, Ralph Lauren, Ulta, Neiman Marcus, and others don\u2019t have HTTPS across their entire website, leaving customers at risk and reducing their conversion rates in the process. Expert Reflections:Aaron Agius, Co-Founder and Managing Director at Louder.Online \u201cI wish I could say I\u2019m surprised that sites (even industry leaders) aren\u2019t moving to HTTPS, given the benefits of doing so. It isn\u2019t just the upcoming addition of the \u2018Not Secure\u2019 notification in Chrome. Google has made it clear for some time that they\u2019re counting HTTPS as a ranking signal and indexing secure pages over unsecured ones. But making the move isn\u2019t as simple as installing a security certificate and calling it a day. Going to HTTPS requires changing internal links, adding the proper canonical links to your <head> section, making sure your CDN is HTTPS compatible and much more. Every step introduces potential complications; large sites are especially at risk, given their sheer number of moving parts. Errors in the process can lead to major crawling issues, duplicate content, and UX problems, which is why it\u2019s a good idea to work with an SEO professional who\u2019s familiar with HTTPS migrations \u2014 no matter what size your company is.\u201d Upgrade to HTTPS to encrypt sensitive data sent across a website and properly integrate with Chrome and other technology to protect visitors and maintain their trust. Understanding the consistent challenges ecommerce leaders face with SEO can help prioritize what issues your organization should look out for. The Varvy SEO tool was used to review 44 of the most prevalent ecommerce retailers to identify the presence of a sitemap, valid HTML, image alt text, and other SEO issues. Reviewing each of the 44 sites illustrated that leading ecommerce firms are dealing with an average of five major SEO-related issues. The most prominent issues these companies had across their websites were: The brands that were the most SEO friendly with only two issues detected were: Improving a website is an ongoing process that even top ecommerce brands need to continually work at. Identify the SEO issues facing your website and start optimizing. By 2020, there will be 200 billion monthly voice search queries, according to Mary Meeker\u2019s Trends Report, highlighting why brands should integrate with popular voice services now. Google Home and Alexa are the two leading voice assistants that are competing aggressively to dominate the growing voice search industry. Brands can create customized experiences by developing an Alexa Skill or a Google Action to seamlessly integrate their own apps and offerings with these services. Beyond ranking organically for voice search, an integration at this level can help a brand better connect with consumers using these platforms. Both the marketplace for Alexa Skills and Google Actions was manually reviewed to determine which ecommerce brands have built integrations on these platforms. After reviewing the 50 leading ecommerce brands, a vast majority of these organizations don\u2019t have any integrations with Alexa or Google Home. The lack of major ecommerce brands developing integrations with these services presents an opportunity for your enterprise to start experimenting with these platforms. Known as the first-mover advantage, by getting active and achieving success on a particular platform, in this case Alexa and/or Google Home, allows an organization to have a competitive edge before a network becomes oversaturated. Honorable Mention: Lowe\u2019s and Best Buy were the only brands with integrations on both Alexa and Google Home, focused on their connected devices, like smart thermostats. Get ahead of the curve and develop a useful integration with one of the leading voice assistant services to reach customers as this technology continues to grow in popularity. At least 50 percent of Google\u2019s global search queries are now from mobile devices, which should act as a reminder as to why it\u2019s essential to optimize for mobile search. Varvy\u2019s Mobile SEO tool was used to review 43 of these top retailers to identify the common optimizations made and the frequent issues these organizations faced. The most common mobile SEO challenges experienced by these brands were: According to Varvy, the tap targets across these sites weren\u2019t large enough as the mobile screen is small and needs big buttons for people to easily navigate by tapping. The rest of the common issues were speed-related errors as every brand had problems with browser caching and almost every site had render blocking CSS or JavaScript that slowed down the page load time. Most of the analyzed brands made the following optimizations for an optimal mobile experience: Pay attention to load time and the usability of a mobile site to help customers navigate the shopping experience and search engines accurately crawl it. Schema is code that can be added to any website to better inform the search engines about how to serve the site\u2019s content in the search results. Whether a site\u2019s pages showcase recipes, reviews, or music, adding schema will help the search engines understand the relevancy of a page as related to a search query. Consumers benefit, too, as the results for a page that\u2019s been marked up with structured data will more accurately reflect the type of information the site offers. For example, this recipe for True Texas Chili on Epicurious has been marked up as a recipe to appear in search with an image, ratings, reviews, and calorie count. The SEMrush Site Audit tool was used to crawl 500 pages from each of the 49 most successful ecommerce sites to determine how prominent the use of schema markup is, as well as open graph, Twitter cards, and microformats. A majority of the analyzed companies, 31 out of 49, use schema on at least 1 percent of their pages. Here\u2019s the breakdown of the frequency of schema markup used across the pages on these websites. It\u2019s clear that adding schema is widely adopted by top ecommerce sites, but most could certainly improve in terms of adding it to a larger percentage of their pages. The reason schema isn\u2019t more widely adopted across a larger portion of pages on many sites is because the process of adding markup can be time consuming. To best approach adding schema to your site, start small by first adding markup to the most important pages based on the sales, conversions, or traffic. In terms of the other types of markup used, Open Graph from Facebook is the most widely used, since the social network is a prevalent marketing medium. Start by adding schema and other relevant types of markup language to the most important pages to best present your site\u2019s content. Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) allow brands to load their pages quickly on mobile devices directly from Google search results. Available for any website to use for free, AMP pages load instantly, provide smooth scrolling, keep a page\u2019s existing styling and branding, and offer the ability to monetize ads. According to Google, these pages load roughly four times faster and use one-tenth the data of pages and objects not built in AMP. A major benefit is that Google gives AMP pages priority in mobile search because it offers a better experience for users. AMP isn\u2019t a ranking signal but more of a preferred format by Google. The first three pages of mobile search results were reviewed manually and a 500-page crawl of each site was completed to detect the use of AMP by the top 49 ecommerce companies. Only three of the 49 reviewed companies, Overstock, JCrew, and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, were using AMP on their website. This lack of AMP adoption for the moment is an opportunity for your organization to turn on AMP across relevant pages and stand out in search for the right reasons. Honorable Mention: While manually reviewing the mobile search results of these brands, it was surprising to see how often AMP pages would appear for these companies via Retale. A mobile deals and discounts app, Retale is the online version of a printed flyer showcasing current offers and coupons from a range of retailers. It appears that Retale also creates local listing pages for many of these brands with AMP to ensure their retail location\u2019s address, phone number, store hours, and weekly offers are featured prominently in Google search. It\u2019s unclear if Retale charges retailers for creating AMP pages for their local stores, but since this feature is free, it\u2019d be easy for these brands to implement them on their own site. These brands would likely earn more of the benefits of AMP by adding it on their website as compared to having their local listings managed by a third party. Implement AMP on your company\u2019s site to provide a seamless, fast experience for customers searching on mobile and to prioritize your pages and content in search. Combine these insights from the top 50 ecommerce brands with an ongoing audit of your site\u2019s progress to achieve success with search. Analyze where your organization stands on a quarterly basis and refer back to this data to evaluate how these ecommerce companies are approaching the same challenges. When evaluating this data, don\u2019t duplicate what the leading brands are doing exactly, but instead, apply the lessons learned to your company\u2019s unique circumstances. After analyzing these findings, it\u2019s time to take action and begin making the necessary optimizations to correct any errors and start experimenting to test new opportunities. Being more informed about the progress of industry leaders, changing technology, and evolving consumer needs will enable an enterprise to succeed with SEO.",

You can get that story across if you follow the three fundamental principles of a three-act play:</p> \n <p>Here is an in-depth breakdown of how you could use social media storytelling to build ongoing relationships, engagement and boost your sales.</p> \n <p>Do you know the difference between music and noise? The answer is simply the formula. A good and effective formula changes noise into music. In the same way the formula you employ in your marketing matters. According to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Epic-Content-Marketing-Different-Customers/dp/0071819894\">Joe Pulizzi</a> author of Epic Content Marketing, You need to know your customers to create a connection. It will also help you tailor a story that resonates with them.</p> \n <p>This means knowing your customers beyond being on a first name basis over email. It means understanding what motivates your target audience and customers. Loyalty to your brand will only develop when they feel connected to the organization and feel that you as a brand care for them as much as they care for you.</p> \n <p>Kathy Ireland, for example, gained celebrity status as a supermodel but attributes her success in business by simply knowing her customers, respecting them and doing everything she can to address their needs in a very unglamorous niche of busy moms.</p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.thinkgeek.com/\">ThinkGeek</a> is another company that truly understands their customer base. They carry a wide variety of thought-provoking products which have huge nerd appeal. With over a million followers on Twitter and Facebook respectively you can see they really engage their audience.</p> \n <p>They are successful because they unabashedly have the same interests as their customers, and are consistent across all their posts. In other words, they come across as human.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>They share behind the scenes activities and historical events to engage their audience without the intent of selling.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>They speak their customer\u2019s language with references to geek culture.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>So how do you understand and learn how your audience engages with a social media platform? Here are three ways to do that:</p> \n <p>Before you can talk about what your customers want, you need to define the problem that stands in their way. There are 3 levels to the problem: the external which most companies tend to address, the internal which is why most customers buy and the philosophical which provides the why the problem is wrong.</p> \n <p>In other words, emotional engagement is as important if not more so than rational engagement. The Dollar Shave Club launch is an example. Their launch video is a great example of how to frame a problem and emphasize the pain point your potential customer\u2019s experience. It is also a fine example of the power of emotion-driven storytelling.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>They launched with an \u201cexplainer video\u201d that went viral just by marrying a simple to the point explanation with a bit of humor driven emotion.</p> \n <p>So how do you define a problem on social media?</p> \n <p>Businesses need to understand that people do not call or ask for help to resolve their physical problems. for example \u2013 fixing a broken hot water system, repairing a car that doesn\u2019t start or mowing a lawn. The external problems may cause a sense of frustration, fear, jealousy etc but there is more than just that motivating them.</p> \n <p>In identifying those motivations talking about resolving the feelings of frustration, or tension you\u2019ll see a greater response to your social media marketing. In other words, when you position the purchase of your product or service to resolve a person\u2019s external, internal and philosophical problems with an action, you are likely to create passionate advocates for your brand like Apple and Coca-Cola.</p> \n <p>So for example when a brand like <a href=\"https://www.blog2social.com/en/howto/\">Blog2Social</a> identifies the issue that WordPress users have with scheduling and cross-promoting their blog posts on social media they could narrate that issue and how it can be solved manually before they introduce their plugin that provides the same result through automation saving time and money. So they could address the three levels of problems like so \u2013</p> \n <p>In the early editions of the Star Wars movie series Luke Skywalker is portrayed as the hero that is unable to reach his Jedi potential until he apprentices under Jedi Masters Obi-Wan \u201cBen\u201d Kenobi and Yoda. Characters like Yoda in the movie serve as a guide to the main character. In the same way, a guide can play a powerful and vital role in the customer experience via social media. <a href=\"https://storybrand.com/workshop/\">Donald</a> Miller, author, and Founder of Storybrand marketing advocates for making customers the hero of your story.</p> \n <p>Why?</p> \n <p>Because a <a href=\"https://www.politicalavenue.com/108642/GAME-DESIGN-BOOK-COLLECTION/Character%20Development%20And%20Storytelling%20For%20Games,%20Lee%20Sheldon.pdf\">hero cannot solve his problems</a>. If he does, then there was no problem. A hero will always have a need. They will, therefore, require someone along the way to help them fill the gap for them to acquire success.</p> \n <p>David Ogilvy is quoted as having said that a good advertisement is one which sells the product without drawing attention to itself. Therefore, it makes sense to take the position of a guide in your storytelling, especially on social media.</p> \n <p>Consider the following responses from the <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions/b2b-sales-strategy-guides/the-state-of-sales-report\">LinkedIn State of Sales Report</a> regarding the most important factor for closing a deal:</p> \n <p>So again we see that taking the position of a guide can only help close more sales.</p> \n <p>Customers are prouder of brands that give them the chance to be heroes. They will see the solution in you as you put yourself in a position to help them achieve their goals. In fact, they tend to buy products from the brands that in their stories come to fill the gaps in customer\u2019s live hence making them winners. So use empathy and authority to help position you as the guide. Customers will feel that you understand what they are going through and that you are in their way to help them.</p> \n <p>For example, Steve Kamb founder of Nerd Fitness doesn\u2019t just share stories of how his students have benefited from the weight loss approach he advocates.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>He also provides advice on how to handle challenges that many in his audience face like in this post.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Ian Cleary founder of Razorsocial does a similar thing by showing his audience how they can gain social media and content success through the best use of tools and automation.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p></p> \n <p>In 2012 <a href=\"http://www.hopehiv.org/\">We See HOPE</a>\u2019s Phil Wall told his story at <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgebradt/2011/04/13/qliktech-ceo-galvanizes-team-delivers-50-growth/#5b1802483ab6\">QlikTech\u2019s </a>annual meeting. The story wasn\u2019t really about Phil but rather about the orphans and vulnerable young people that his charity helps in Africa. He also talked about those that do the actual helping and those that raise the money to help. At the end of his talk, the 1,100 attendees were compelled to action.</p> \n <p>His story had 3 simple yet essential parts \u2013</p> \n <p>If you know your customers and have defined the problem they encounter, have positioned yourself as a guide you need to provide them with a plan of action to overcome the challenge.</p> \n <p>The idea here is to break down the solution into bite-sized pieces that people can understand and act on easily. People\u2019s brains don\u2019t cope very well with ambiguity or confusion. So by providing them with steps, you are helping your audience gain clarity and understanding of how their challenge can be overcome.</p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TonyRobbins/\">Tony Robbins</a>, for example, does this regularly on his social media accounts. Take the following post that also provides credibility as it is a repost from Inc.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RobertKiyosaki/\">Robert Kiyosaki</a> does similar things on his Facebook account like this post:</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>According to <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/psychology-of-the-cta/\">Jeremy Smith,</a> audiences today expect a call to action.</p> \n <p>So how do you do add an effective call to action?</p> \n <p>By making it obvious to your audience. Most social media platforms have made it easy by creating suitable user interfaces. All you need to do is craft a suitable call to action.</p> \n <p>Your <a href=\"https://maximizesocialbusiness.com/how-to-create-social-media-calls-to-action-9328/\">call to action</a> should encourage your audience to engage with you further.</p> \n <p>So make them an offer they\u2019ll want. Your offer will depend on your business and where the prospect is at in the sales process so consider what you will offer \u2013 white papers, ebooks, email course, discount coupons or free consultations.</p> \n <p>A good way to think about it is to answer the question \u2013 What\u2019s in it for them?</p> \n <p>People on most social media platforms are there to socialize not to buy. So give your audience a reason to act once you have built a relationship with them. This is where storytelling comes in.</p> \n <p>According to author <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Developing-Story-Ideas-Michael-Rabiger/dp/0240807367\">Michael Rabiger</a> a story requires tension or conflict for the hero to overcome. So build your calls to action by starting with the customer as the hero.</p> \n <p>Then ensure you have answered these questions in your story as you consider the call to action:</p> \n <p>Once you have the answers your call to action essentially becomes a roadmap for how a customer can achieve a positive outcome and avoid a negative one. So take the time to carefully craft a picture of opposing futures. If your audience isn\u2019t inspired by them they will not buy. Consider using visual media where possible.</p> \n <p>Social media storytelling is a powerful way of engaging your audience and building trust before a sale. This is especially necessary if you are selling a product or service that is upwards of a few hundred dollars. Consultative purchases are a good example of this. In such instances, a lot of education and information is required for enough trust to be built before a purchase.</p> \n <p>HubSpot, for example, has leveraged the opportunity to build trust with its target audience by offering a number of resources and insights that help businesses with their inbound marketing.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>By positioning themselves as a guide and providing plans of action they routinely are able to get their audience to act on their calls to action.</p> \n <p>The key to boosting sales with social media, however, lies in storytelling but even before that with knowing the profile of your target audience and how they interact and relate to different platforms, as each one requires different uses. It\u2019s also fundamental to understand the \u201cculture\u201d or idiosyncrasies of each.</p> \n</div>",

ThinkGeek is another company that truly understands their customer base. They carry a wide variety of thought-provoking products which have huge nerd appeal. With over a million followers on Twitter and Facebook respectively you can see they really engage their audience. They are successful because they unabashedly have the same interests as their customers, and are consistent across all their posts. In other words, they come across as human. They share behind the scenes activities and historical events to engage their audience without the intent of selling. They speak their customer\u2019s language with references to geek culture. So how do you understand and learn how your audience engages with a social media platform? Here are three ways to do that: Before you can talk about what your customers want, you need to define the problem that stands in their way. There are 3 levels to the problem: the external which most companies tend to address, the internal which is why most customers buy and the philosophical which provides the why the problem is wrong. In other words, emotional engagement is as important if not more so than rational engagement. The Dollar Shave Club launch is an example. Their launch video is a great example of how to frame a problem and emphasize the pain point your potential customer\u2019s experience. It is also a fine example of the power of emotion-driven storytelling. They launched with an \u201cexplainer video\u201d that went viral just by marrying a simple to the point explanation with a bit of humor driven emotion. So how do you define a problem on social media? Businesses need to understand that people do not call or ask for help to resolve their physical problems. for example \u2013 fixing a broken hot water system, repairing a car that doesn\u2019t start or mowing a lawn. The external problems may cause a sense of frustration, fear, jealousy etc but there is more than just that motivating them. In identifying those motivations talking about resolving the feelings of frustration, or tension you\u2019ll see a greater response to your social media marketing. In other words, when you position the purchase of your product or service to resolve a person\u2019s external, internal and philosophical problems with an action, you are likely to create passionate advocates for your brand like Apple and Coca-Cola. So for example when a brand like Blog2Social identifies the issue that WordPress users have with scheduling and cross-promoting their blog posts on social media they could narrate that issue and how it can be solved manually before they introduce their plugin that provides the same result through automation saving time and money. So they could address the three levels of problems like so \u2013 In the early editions of the Star Wars movie series Luke Skywalker is portrayed as the hero that is unable to reach his Jedi potential until he apprentices under Jedi Masters Obi-Wan \u201cBen\u201d Kenobi and Yoda. Characters like Yoda in the movie serve as a guide to the main character. In the same way, a guide can play a powerful and vital role in the customer experience via social media. Donald Miller, author, and Founder of Storybrand marketing advocates for making customers the hero of your story. Why? Because a hero cannot solve his problems. If he does, then there was no problem. A hero will always have a need. They will, therefore, require someone along the way to help them fill the gap for them to acquire success. David Ogilvy is quoted as having said that a good advertisement is one which sells the product without drawing attention to itself. Therefore, it makes sense to take the position of a guide in your storytelling, especially on social media. Consider the following responses from the LinkedIn State of Sales Report regarding the most important factor for closing a deal: So again we see that taking the position of a guide can only help close more sales. Customers are prouder of brands that give them the chance to be heroes. They will see the solution in you as you put yourself in a position to help them achieve their goals. In fact, they tend to buy products from the brands that in their stories come to fill the gaps in customer\u2019s live hence making them winners. So use empathy and authority to help position you as the guide. Customers will feel that you understand what they are going through and that you are in their way to help them. For example, Steve Kamb founder of Nerd Fitness doesn\u2019t just share stories of how his students have benefited from the weight loss approach he advocates. He also provides advice on how to handle challenges that many in his audience face like in this post. Ian Cleary founder of Razorsocial does a similar thing by showing his audience how they can gain social media and content success through the best use of tools and automation. In 2012 We See HOPE\u2019s Phil Wall told his story at QlikTech\u2019s annual meeting. The story wasn\u2019t really about Phil but rather about the orphans and vulnerable young people that his charity helps in Africa. He also talked about those that do the actual helping and those that raise the money to help. At the end of his talk, the 1,100 attendees were compelled to action. His story had 3 simple yet essential parts \u2013 If you know your customers and have defined the problem they encounter, have positioned yourself as a guide you need to provide them with a plan of action to overcome the challenge. The idea here is to break down the solution into bite-sized pieces that people can understand and act on easily. People\u2019s brains don\u2019t cope very well with ambiguity or confusion. So by providing them with steps, you are helping your audience gain clarity and understanding of how their challenge can be overcome. Tony Robbins, for example, does this regularly on his social media accounts. Take the following post that also provides credibility as it is a repost from Inc. Robert Kiyosaki does similar things on his Facebook account like this post: According to Jeremy Smith, audiences today expect a call to action. So how do you do add an effective call to action? By making it obvious to your audience. Most social media platforms have made it easy by creating suitable user interfaces. All you need to do is craft a suitable call to action. Your call to action should encourage your audience to engage with you further. So make them an offer they\u2019ll want. Your offer will depend on your business and where the prospect is at in the sales process so consider what you will offer \u2013 white papers, ebooks, email course, discount coupons or free consultations. A good way to think about it is to answer the question \u2013 What\u2019s in it for them? People on most social media platforms are there to socialize not to buy. So give your audience a reason to act once you have built a relationship with them. This is where storytelling comes in. According to author Michael Rabiger a story requires tension or conflict for the hero to overcome. So build your calls to action by starting with the customer as the hero. Then ensure you have answered these questions in your story as you consider the call to action: Once you have the answers your call to action essentially becomes a roadmap for how a customer can achieve a positive outcome and avoid a negative one. So take the time to carefully craft a picture of opposing futures. If your audience isn\u2019t inspired by them they will not buy. Consider using visual media where possible. Social media storytelling is a powerful way of engaging your audience and building trust before a sale. This is especially necessary if you are selling a product or service that is upwards of a few hundred dollars. Consultative purchases are a good example of this. In such instances, a lot of education and information is required for enough trust to be built before a purchase. HubSpot, for example, has leveraged the opportunity to build trust with its target audience by offering a number of resources and insights that help businesses with their inbound marketing. By positioning themselves as a guide and providing plans of action they routinely are able to get their audience to act on their calls to action. The key to boosting sales with social media, however, lies in storytelling but even before that with knowing the profile of your target audience and how they interact and relate to different platforms, as each one requires different uses. It\u2019s also fundamental to understand the \u201cculture\u201d or idiosyncrasies of each.",

        "structuredText": "<div> \n <p>It\u2019s finally happening. After nearly a decade of delays, the Food and Drug Administration is <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/07/fda-head-says-trump-creating-broader-nutrition-policy-244650\">expected to implement</a> an Obama-era policy that will require restaurants and other food outlets with 20 or more locations to post calorie counts beginning May 2018. </p> \n <p>Any big chain \u2014 from grocery stores to movie theaters, amusement parks to vending machines, and restaurants \u2014 will have to show how many calories come with their sandwiches, popcorn, cocktails, and French fries. Up front. Right on the menus. </p> \n <p>In some eateries, menu labeling is already happening. Several major chains started to move in this direction because the FDA was expected to finalize this regulation years ago. It\u2019s why you can see that your <a href=\"https://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/espresso/caffe-latte\">Grande Latte at Starbucks</a> has 190 calories, your <a href=\"https://www.panerabread.com/en-us/menu-categories/sandwiches-panini.html#roasted-turkey-apple-cheddar-sandwich\">turkey, apple, and cheddar sandwich at Panera</a> has 710 calories, and your <a href=\"http://nutrition.mcdonalds.com/usnutritionexchange/nutritionfacts.pdf\">McDonald\u2019s Big Mac packs 530 calories</a>, for example. </p> \n <p>But we\u2019ll soon be saturated in calorie data \u2014 everywhere. These changes aren\u2019t expected to cause Americans to suddenly clean up their diets, but they could have profound indirect effects on how we think about food and nutrition, what we choose from the menu, and ultimately what restaurants serve. </p> \n <p>Americans do a lot of their eating outside of the home these days. More than half of the money spent on food goes to restaurants and convenient on-the-go meals \u2014 not to groceries cooked at home. </p> \n <p>Make no mistake: When we dine out, we eat more. People typically consume <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/12/3/7324047/how-to-count-calories\">20 to 40 percent more calories</a> in restaurants compared with what they\u2019d eat at home. We do that because it\u2019s easy to do in restaurants. As Tuft University researchers found, in the <a href=\"http://www.andjrnl.org/article/S2212-2672%2815%2901736-0/abstract\">Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics</a>, restaurant dishes at nonchain establishments across the country typically contained 1,200 calories \u2014 about half of the 2,000 or 2,500 calories recommended for moderately active women and men in an entire day. For these reasons, the American propensity to dine out has been <a href=\"http://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2017/03/29/portion-sizes\">linked with the obesity epidemic</a>. </p> \n <p>For a long time, consumers were left to operate blindly when it came to knowing how many calories they were consuming. Unlike the nutrition facts panels that come with preprepared foods we eat at home, there was no such transparency around restaurant food. </p> \n <p>Then along came the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Buried among its many provisions were rules requiring \"retail food establishments\" with 20 or more locations to post \"on the menu listing the item for sale, the number of calories contained in the standard menu item,\u201d as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/11/25/7279689/obamacare-menu-calorie-labels\">Vox\u2019s Sarah Kliff reported</a>. Another section in the law mandated vending machines \"provide a sign in close proximity to each article of food or the selection button that includes a clear and conspicuous statement disclosing the number of calories contained in the article.\" </p> \n <p>The hope was that these regulations would help people calculate how many calories they were eating, and maybe make an impact on obesity. </p> \n <p>The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the food industry, was in charge of finalizing and implementing menu labeling. But the Obamacare mandates, even under President Barack Obama, were beset by delays because of intense lobbying from various factions of the food industry. </p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/pizza-chains-are-making-a-desperate-push-to-avoid-posting-calories-on-menus/2017/04/06/080a8d5e-18b0-11e7-bcc2-7d1a0973e7b2_story.html?utm_term=.22efc03b23d4\">American pizza makers</a> have pushed for, among other things, only posting calories for serving sizes they determine, instead of the actual serving sizes people are going to eat. Convenience stores and supermarkets argued menu labeling, while appropriate for restaurants, would be <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-menu-labeling-impact-0503-biz-20170502-story.html\">too expensive and burdensome</a> for them. Movie theaters for their part tried to keep their <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/battling-the-popcorn-lobby/2012/03/20/gIQAhC8uPS_blog.html?utm_term=.628e784fc3be\">1,000-calorie popcorns</a> out of the calorie postings. </p> \n <p>On Thursday, the FDA finally released <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/11/09/2017-24246/guidance-menu-labeling\">draft guidance</a> about how the industry will have to comply with the menu labeling rule by May 2018.

        "text": "It\u2019s finally happening. After nearly a decade of delays, the Food and Drug Administration is expected to implement an Obama-era policy that will require restaurants and other food outlets with 20 or more locations to post calorie counts beginning May 2018. Any big chain \u2014 from grocery stores to movie theaters, amusement parks to vending machines, and restaurants \u2014 will have to show how many calories come with their sandwiches, popcorn, cocktails, and French fries. Up front. Right on the menus. In some eateries, menu labeling is already happening. Several major chains started to move in this direction because the FDA was expected to finalize this regulation years ago. It\u2019s why you can see that your Grande Latte at Starbucks has 190 calories, your turkey, apple, and cheddar sandwich at Panera has 710 calories, and your McDonald\u2019s Big Mac packs 530 calories, for example. But we\u2019ll soon be saturated in calorie data \u2014 everywhere. These changes aren\u2019t expected to cause Americans to suddenly clean up their diets, but they could have profound indirect effects on how we think about food and nutrition, what we choose from the menu, and ultimately what restaurants serve. Americans do a lot of their eating outside of the home these days. More than half of the money spent on food goes to restaurants and convenient on-the-go meals \u2014 not to groceries cooked at home. Make no mistake: When we dine out, we eat more. People typically consume 20 to 40 percent more calories in restaurants compared with what they\u2019d eat at home. We do that because it\u2019s easy to do in restaurants. As Tuft University researchers found, in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, restaurant dishes at nonchain establishments across the country typically contained 1,200 calories \u2014 about half of the 2,000 or 2,500 calories recommended for moderately active women and men in an entire day. For these reasons, the American propensity to dine out has been linked with the obesity epidemic. For a long time, consumers were left to operate blindly when it came to knowing how many calories they were consuming. Unlike the nutrition facts panels that come with preprepared foods we eat at home, there was no such transparency around restaurant food. Then along came the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Buried among its many provisions were rules requiring \"retail food establishments\" with 20 or more locations to post \"on the menu listing the item for sale, the number of calories contained in the standard menu item,\u201d as Vox\u2019s Sarah Kliff reported. Another section in the law mandated vending machines \"provide a sign in close proximity to each article of food or the selection button that includes a clear and conspicuous statement disclosing the number of calories contained in the article.\" The hope was that these regulations would help people calculate how many calories they were eating, and maybe make an impact on obesity. The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the food industry, was in charge of finalizing and implementing menu labeling. But the Obamacare mandates, even under President Barack Obama, were beset by delays because of intense lobbying from various factions of the food industry. American pizza makers have pushed for, among other things, only posting calories for serving sizes they determine, instead of the actual serving sizes people are going to eat. Convenience stores and supermarkets argued menu labeling, while appropriate for restaurants, would be too expensive and burdensome for them. Movie theaters for their part tried to keep their 1,000-calorie popcorns out of the calorie postings. On Thursday, the FDA finally released draft guidance about how the industry will have to comply with the menu labeling rule by May 2018. Health advocates said they were pleased to see the rule was left mostly intact. \u201cI was relieved to see details of the guidance for FDA,\u201d said Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. \u201cIt didn\u2019t substantively change the way calories will be disclosed.\u201d This came as a surprise, because the Trump administration had pushed back the implementation of the rule just before it was supposed to go into effect last May. CSPI has sued the FDA over menu labeling, arguing that its delays were not legal. The nonprofit put the lawsuit on hold in September because the administration reassured the group that they planned to move forward with the May 2018 deadline. \u201cSo our agreement with the agency \u2014 that has been signed off on by a judge \u2014 is also reassuring,\u201d said Wootan. But the fact that the guidance was released far ahead of the rule\u2019s implementation date suggests businesses will have plenty of time to comply (and little space to argue that they didn\u2019t have enough time to meet the requirements of the regulation). The FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb also pledged his personal interest in getting this job done, as Politico\u2019s Helena Bottemiller Evich reported, and announced his agency\u2019s commitment to nutrition. \u201cAs someone who enjoys eating out with my family and picking up the occasional take-out meal, I \u2014 like many Americans \u2014 want to know what\u2019s in the food I eat,\u201d Gottlieb said in a statement. \u201cFDA takes seriously the authority Congress granted to us in overseeing federal food labeling standards, including our mandate to make calorie information available on menus.\u201d \u201cNow there\u2019s a different administration in place that didn\u2019t drive calorie labeling from the beginning saying they\u2019re going to implement it in 2018,\u201d said Jason Block, a physician and researcher at Harvard Medical School who has been studying calorie labeling. \u201cI think most of us are fairly confident that it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d The evidence we have on calorie labeling\u2019s impact on health is pretty mixed. The studies and meta-analyses either suggest that calorie labeling has had little impact on people's food choices or that the available studies are too poorly designed to really tell. Researchers have also found that people who are already calorie-conscious do pay attention to labels, but those who aren't don't. In other words, just having that information displayed doesn't change people's behaviors. So health wonks don\u2019t expect people will immediately start making healthier food choices when menu labels come out. But calorie labeling is expected to do two other things: push food producers to reformulate products so that they aren\u2019t so hideously high in calories, and change consumer attitudes about nutrition. Researchers have found that after a menu labeling was implemented in Seattle in 2009, food purveyors tweaked their recipes and lowered calories, for example.

La possibilit\u00e9 de consulter les infos trafic et m\u00e9t\u00e9o est bien entendu disponibles, tout comme celle de t\u00e9l\u00e9charger des plans de villes (afin d\u2019avoir constamment une carte sur soit) ainsi que celle de pouvoir consulter ses calories ! Une des applications Apple Watch les plus compl\u00e8tes donc, pens\u00e9e pour les touristes souvent perdus dans leurs tentatives d\u2019explorations.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Voil\u00e0 une des applications Apple Watch qui plaira tr\u00e8s certainement aux ferroviphile.

De nombreux moyens de paiements sont autoris\u00e9s (CB, ch\u00e8que-vacances\u2026), mais surtout, il est possible de payer son billet au moment voulu ! Une aubaine non ?</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Plus besoin de pr\u00e9senter le c\u00e9l\u00e8bre site de r\u00e9servation en ligne. TripAdvisor est devenu depuis quelques ann\u00e9es l\u2019un des piliers incontournables des applications Apple Watch de tourisme. R\u00e9server une chambre d\u2019h\u00f4tel ou trouver le restaurant de ses r\u00eaves, que ce soit \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de chez vous ou \u00e0 l\u2019autre bout du monde, n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi simple.

De plus si vous manquez d\u2019inspiration pour sortir, la fonctionnalit\u00e9 \u201cpr\u00e8s d\u2019ici\u201d se chargera de d\u00e9tecter pour vous les diverses attractions disponibles dans les environs.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Recherchez un vol partout dans le monde, et ce avec des centaines de compagnies a\u00e9riennes !

Point fort par rapport \u00e0 d\u2019autres applications Apple Watch, elle propose des offres jumel\u00e9es avec des h\u00f4tels dans plus de 197 pays, et la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9server une voiture \u00e0 votre arriv\u00e9e directement avec l\u2019application est comprise.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Cette application permet de localiser \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s tout ce qui se trouve autour de vous, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019une banque, d\u2019un h\u00f4pital, d\u2019une station essence ou bien m\u00eame d\u2019un h\u00f4tel, d\u2019un restaurant ou d\u2019une station de taxis ! L\u2019application se sert du GPS de votre Apple Watch et indique via des points d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats les r\u00e9sultats de vos recherches. De plus l\u2019application vous permet d\u2019utiliser vos propres termes pour rechercher ce que vous d\u00e9sirez via Siri (chose encore rare sur les <a href=\"https://www.objetconnecte.net/deux-nouvelles-apple-watch-sport-pour-l2834/\">Apple Watch</a>). Pratique.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Tout sportif r\u00e9gulier connait cette application con\u00e7ue sp\u00e9cialement con\u00e7ue pour la course \u00e0 pied, le v\u00e9lo et la marche. Comme les bracelets et ceintures connect\u00e9s, elle enregistre la moindre de vos activit\u00e9s physiques : distance, dur\u00e9e, vitesse, changement d\u2019altitude, calories br\u00fbl\u00e9es et plus encore\u2026 Runtastic comprend diversentrainements \u00e0 adapter en fonction de vos performances ainsi qu\u2019un coach vocal.

Dans cette application,les chercheurs ont s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9 12 exercices de 30 secondes entrecoup\u00e9s de pause de 10 secondes. Pendant ces 7 minutes, vous ferez de l\u2019exercice comme si vous en faisiez pendant 1 heure ! En plus, contrairement \u00e0 d\u2019autres applications Apple Watch, ces entra\u00eenements sont simples et ne n\u00e9cessitent aucun mat\u00e9riel, ce qui signifie que vous n\u2019avez plus d\u2019excuse pour ne pas vous y mettre !</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Cette application agit comme un coach personnel. Choisissezparmi les 100 entra\u00eenements propos\u00e9s, puis diffusez-les sur vos appareils gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l\u2019airplay. Des vid\u00e9os et conseils sont disponibles avec les exercices afin d\u2019offrir un coaching complet. Comme pour beaucoup d\u2019applications Apple Watch d\u00e9di\u00e9es au sport, la possibilit\u00e9 de surveiller votre temps d\u2019effort ainsi que de regarder vos calories est bien entendu pr\u00e9vue. \u00c0 noter que Nike Training Club se destine plut\u00f4t \u00e0 un public f\u00e9minin.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Human ne fait pas r\u00e9ellement partie des applications Apple Watch d\u00e9di\u00e9es au sport, cependant elle offre un certain concept pour le moins \u2026 int\u00e9ressant. Son but ? Vous faire bouger au moins 30 minutes par jour, cela afin de rester en bonne sant\u00e9 ! L\u2019application calcule votre temps d\u2019activit\u00e9 total de la journ\u00e9e et, en cas de sous-activit\u00e9, vous incitera \u00e0 bouger tant que vous n\u2019aurez pas atteint cet objectif. Human enregistre vos donn\u00e9es et cr\u00e9\u00e9e donc par la suite un journal quotidien de vos d\u00e9placements, mais aussi de votre temps d\u2019inactivit\u00e9, il est m\u00eame possible de retracer ses parcours et de les partager sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Strava est une de ses applications Apple Watch qui s\u2019adressent aux coureurs ainsi qu\u2019aux cyclistes aguerris souhaitant d\u00e9fier les autres membres de la communaut\u00e9. En effet, au-del\u00e0 du fait de calculer vos statistiques (vitesse, distance, calories brul\u00e9es\u2026) et de mesurer votre fr\u00e9quence cardiaque, il est \u00e9galement possible de d\u00e9fier ses amis ou simplement d\u2019essayer de battre les diff\u00e9rents records. Par exemple, si vous vous rendez dans un parc, vous pourrez regarder les divers records des autres coureurs sur ce lieu.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Shazam est l\u2019une des applications Apple Watch les plus utilis\u00e9es tous les jours. Exactement identique \u00e0 celle de l\u2019iPhone, vous pourrez donc \u201cshazamer\u201d les musiques que vous entendez avec votre smartwatch, que vous poss\u00e9diez du r\u00e9seau ou non.Il sera \u00e9galement possible de consulter les paroles des chansons, ainsi que de les partager sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>\u201cCe n\u2019est pas juste une application pour DJ, c\u2019est du deejaying r\u00e9invent\u00e9 pour les \u00e9crans tactiles\u201d explique le magazine Wired. En effet, Pacemaker permet de mixer vos morceaux (\u00e0 partir d\u2019iTunes ou de Spotify) simplement du bout des doigts ! Ajoutez votre musique, cliquez sur play et \u00e9coutez ! C\u2019est un peu comme avoir un DJ personnel \u00e0 son poignet. Vous pourrez notamment rajouter \u00e0 vos morceaux des effets live et autres modifications, mais surtout il sera possible d\u2019activerle mode Autopilot, une sorte de DJ particulier qui mixera pour vous.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Les applications Apple Watch servent aussi \u00e0 se cultiver ! Instapaper permet de sauvegarder des articles dans le but de les lire plus tard en mode hors ligne, et ce, dans une mise en page impeccable. Plut\u00f4t pratique pour les globe-trotters toujours entre deux avions. De plus il est possible de choisir la police, les couleurs et les options d\u2019interligne afin de vous procurer le plus grand confort lors de votre lecture. Si \u00e0 un quelconque moment, vos yeux semblent trop fatigu\u00e9s pour continuer leurs t\u00e2ches, vous pourrez activer le syst\u00e8me de synth\u00e8se vocale et simplement \u00e9couter vos articles !</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>La fameuse application de prise de note et d\u2019organisation du travail a \u00e9galement eu droit \u00e0 sa version Apple Watch. Cette derni\u00e8re propose toutes les fonctionnalit\u00e9s pr\u00e9sentes sur celle du smartphone, avec bien entendu un syst\u00e8me vocal tr\u00e8s au point. Toutes vos notes et recherches seront automatiquement synchronis\u00e9es sur tous les autres appareils poss\u00e9dant l\u2019application. Bref, Evernote sur une smartwatch.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Oublier son mot de passe fait partie des probl\u00e8mes du quotidien\u2026 1password a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 dans le but de supprimer cet incident souvent emb\u00eatant. En effet, cette application stocke toutes vos informations et vous permet, par la suite, de vous connecter en un simple clic ! Identifiants, carte de cr\u00e9dit ou notes s\u00e9curis\u00e9es, tout est enregistr\u00e9 puis utilis\u00e9 l\u00e0 o\u00f9 vous le souhaitez, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019il vous suffira de vous rendre sur le site qui vous int\u00e9resse, et l\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rera automatiquement les informations n\u00e9cessaires. Elle fait partie des applications Apple Watch qui chiffrent toutes vos donn\u00e9es gr\u00e2ce au chiffrement authentifi\u00e9 AES 256-bit, et prot\u00e8gent ces derni\u00e8res m\u00eame si votre appareil est perdu ou vol\u00e9. L\u2019option de Touch ID est \u00e9galement disponible.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Sur l\u2019iPhone, \u201cJust Press Record\u201d une application tr\u00e8s efficace pour r\u00e9aliser des enregistrements rapides : appuyez sur le bouton d\u2019enregistrement, capturez de l\u2019audio, arr\u00eatez l\u2019enregistrement, et synchronisez tout \u00e7a directement sur votre Cloud. Avec watchOS 2, tout cela vient \u00e0 votre poignet, et vous pouvez enregistrer sans avoir votre iPhone \u00e0 port\u00e9e de main. Et en plus, la prochaine fois que vous vous connecterez, vos enregistrements seront transf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 votre iPhone.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Sky Guide est une des applications Apple Watch les plus belles et les plus pr\u00e9cises de guides d\u2019\u00e9toiles et de constellations. L\u2019application compagnon vous donne un calendrier des \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e0 venir, et des notifications (facultatives) concernant ce qui est sur le point de se produire dans votre emplacement.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Cette application est id\u00e9ale pour trouver rapidement des commerces de proximit\u00e9 par cat\u00e9gorie en appuyant sur un bouton : banque, bar, spa, zoo\u2026 Bref, tous les points d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat. L\u2019application permet m\u00eame d\u2019utiliser vos propres termes de recherche via Siri par contr\u00f4le vocal (actuellement de chose rare sur Apple Watch).</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Kitchen Stories est probablement la meilleure application Apple Watch \u00e0 poss\u00e9der pour tous les amoureux de cuisine, mais qui oublient souvent la liste de course elle offre la possibilit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er une liste de course directement depuis la montre. On peut ainsi cocher les ingr\u00e9dients que l\u2019on a d\u00e9j\u00e0, ou que l\u2019on ach\u00e8te, sans avoir besoin de sortir l\u2019iPhone. Et puis bien s\u00fbr, elle vous donne acc\u00e8s \u00e0 tout plein de recettes. C\u2019est b\u00eate, mais c\u2019est foutrement pratique.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Trivial Crack est le jeu le plus t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9 au monde, il \u00e9tait donc logique qu\u2019elle rejoigne les applications Apple Watch. Comme sur iPhone, il est possible de jouer avec vos amis en les d\u00e9fiant dans diverses cat\u00e9gories : g\u00e9ographie, histoire, art, science, divertissement et sport. Mais dans ce jeu, les connaissances ne suffisent pas toujours, puisqu\u2019il faut savoir faire preuve d\u2019intelligence lors des duels, cela afin de grappiller des points suppl\u00e9mentaires.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Rules! est une application de puzzle, avec une mini-jeu sp\u00e9cial qui la fait rentrer dans les applications Apple Watch. Il vous faudra atteindre des objectifs journaliers en r\u00e9alisant dix niveaux de jeu. Rules! s\u2019appuyant sur les couleurs, une aide pour les personnes souffrant de daltonisme a m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue !</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Peak est un programme d\u2019entra\u00eenement personnalis\u00e9 qui, \u00e0 travers divers jeux, vous aidera \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer vos capacit\u00e9s c\u00e9r\u00e9brales : la m\u00e9moire, la concentration, le langage, la cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 ainsi que le raisonnement et l\u2019agilit\u00e9 mentale. Diff\u00e9rents jeux et exercices de 45 secondes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7us sp\u00e9cialement pour l\u2019inclure dans le catalogue des applications Apple Watch. Suivez vos performances et regardez vos points forts comme vos faiblesses, s\u2019am\u00e9liorer au fil des jours.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Ce jeu, devenu un v\u00e9ritable best-seller des applications Apple Watch, pr\u00e9sente l\u2019histoire de l\u2019astronaute Taylor. Apr\u00e8s un atterrissage catastrophique, il se retrouve en situation de d\u00e9tresse sur une lune d\u00e9sol\u00e9e. Vous \u00eates la seule personne \u00e0 pouvoir communiquer avec lui via un syst\u00e8me de notification. Vous pourrez d\u00e9sormais r\u00e9pondre directement \u00e0 Taylor via votre Apple Watch, sans avoir n\u00e9cessairement besoin d\u2019une connexion internet. De plus il est possible de plonger dans les \u00e9v\u00e9nements ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 l\u2019histoire, afin de d\u00e9couvrir ce qui se passerait si vous effectuiez un choix diff\u00e9rent. Lifenine est un jeu ouvert et tr\u00e8s libre, cependant prenez bien en compte que chaque d\u00e9cision que vous prendrez, influencera sur la survie de l\u2019astronaute Taylor.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Il s\u2019agit tout simplement de la version de 2048, mais pour Apple Watch. Vous pourrez par exemple commencer une partie chez vous sur votre smartphone, et la terminer dans les transports sur votre smartwatch. Plut\u00f4t pratique pour les amoureux de l\u2019application qui, au moindre moment de libert\u00e9, se pr\u00e9cipiteront sur leur montre pour jouer.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Runeblade est un jeu con\u00e7u pour l\u2019Apple Watch sp\u00e9cifiquement, ce qui est assez rare pour le signaler. Le but est simple, traverser diff\u00e9rentes zones de jeux en se d\u00e9barrassant des ennemis que vous allez rencontrer. Vous gagnerez de l\u2019argent qu\u2019il faudra ensuite \u00e9changer contre diverses comp\u00e9tences. L\u2019application est \u00e9galement disponible sur iPhone, mais a surtout pour but de montrer l\u2019univers du jeu avant de vous y plonger sur la montre connect\u00e9e.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Si vous \u00eates du genre \u00e0 oublier les d\u00e9tails importants (le mot de passe du WiFi, un nouveau num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone \u2026), Cheatsheet vous permet de faire une liste de petites notes pour les stocker sur votre Apple Watch. Chaque liste peut avoir son propre ic\u00f4ne, afin de les rendre plus facile \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre, et vous pouvez les configurer afin qu\u2019elles apparaissent sur l\u2019\u00e9cran principal de la montre.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Un dictionnaire sur le poignet peut sembler \u00eatre une id\u00e9e saugrenue. Apr\u00e8s tout, pas besoin de ce genre d\u2019applications Apple Watch pour trouver l\u2019orthographe ou le sens d\u2019un mot. Cependant, l\u2019avantage principal de cette application est l\u2019utilisation du micro de la montre : vous pourrez, en effet, \u00e9noncer un mot pour le retrouver instantan\u00e9ment dans le dictionnaire. Un fois que le mot est entr\u00e9 dans le dictionnaire, vous pouvez acc\u00e9dez \u00e0 une d\u00e9finition et m\u00eame acc\u00e9der \u00e0 des synonymes. Par ailleurs, elle sera d\u2019une grande utilit\u00e9 aux amoureux de la langue qui souhaitent diversifier leur vocabulaire gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la fonction \u201cmot du jour\u201d.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Reminders a mis du temps \u00e0 se frayer un chemin parmi les applications Apple Watch, malgr\u00e9 son succ\u00e8s sur iPhone. Mais elle est bien l\u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui, et ce depuis watchOS3. Bien qu\u2019elle soit en retard sur le march\u00e9 des montres connect\u00e9es,l\u2019application reste tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressante.</p> \n <p>Tout d\u2019abord, elle pr\u00e9sente les diff\u00e9rentes listes que vous cr\u00e9ez par ordre alphab\u00e9tique.

Plus besoin de pr\u00e9senter le c\u00e9l\u00e8bre site de r\u00e9servation en ligne.

L\u2019application se sert du GPS de votre Apple Watch et indique via des points d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats les r\u00e9sultats de vos recherches.

Human ne fait pas r\u00e9ellement partie des applications Apple Watch d\u00e9di\u00e9es au sport, cependant elle offre un certain concept pour le moins \u2026 int\u00e9ressant. Son but ? Vous faire bouger au moins 30 minutes par jour, cela afin de rester en bonne sant\u00e9 ! L\u2019application calcule votre temps d\u2019activit\u00e9 total de la journ\u00e9e et, en cas de sous-activit\u00e9, vous incitera \u00e0 bouger tant que vous n\u2019aurez pas atteint cet objectif. Human enregistre vos donn\u00e9es et cr\u00e9\u00e9e donc par la suite un journal quotidien de vos d\u00e9placements, mais aussi de votre temps d\u2019inactivit\u00e9, il est m\u00eame possible de retracer ses parcours et de les partager sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux. Strava est une de ses applications Apple Watch qui s\u2019adressent aux coureurs ainsi qu\u2019aux cyclistes aguerris souhaitant d\u00e9fier les autres membres de la communaut\u00e9. En effet, au-del\u00e0 du fait de calculer vos statistiques (vitesse, distance, calories brul\u00e9es\u2026) et de mesurer votre fr\u00e9quence cardiaque, il est \u00e9galement possible de d\u00e9fier ses amis ou simplement d\u2019essayer de battre les diff\u00e9rents records. Par exemple, si vous vous rendez dans un parc, vous pourrez regarder les divers records des autres coureurs sur ce lieu. Shazam est l\u2019une des applications Apple Watch les plus utilis\u00e9es tous les jours. Exactement identique \u00e0 celle de l\u2019iPhone, vous pourrez donc \u201cshazamer\u201d les musiques que vous entendez avec votre smartwatch, que vous poss\u00e9diez du r\u00e9seau ou non.Il sera \u00e9galement possible de consulter les paroles des chansons, ainsi que de les partager sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux. \u201cCe n\u2019est pas juste une application pour DJ, c\u2019est du deejaying r\u00e9invent\u00e9 pour les \u00e9crans tactiles\u201d explique le magazine Wired. En effet, Pacemaker permet de mixer vos morceaux (\u00e0 partir d\u2019iTunes ou de Spotify) simplement du bout des doigts ! Ajoutez votre musique, cliquez sur play et \u00e9coutez ! C\u2019est un peu comme avoir un DJ personnel \u00e0 son poignet. Vous pourrez notamment rajouter \u00e0 vos morceaux des effets live et autres modifications, mais surtout il sera possible d\u2019activerle mode Autopilot, une sorte de DJ particulier qui mixera pour vous. Les applications Apple Watch servent aussi \u00e0 se cultiver ! Instapaper permet de sauvegarder des articles dans le but de les lire plus tard en mode hors ligne, et ce, dans une mise en page impeccable. Plut\u00f4t pratique pour les globe-trotters toujours entre deux avions. De plus il est possible de choisir la police, les couleurs et les options d\u2019interligne afin de vous procurer le plus grand confort lors de votre lecture. Si \u00e0 un quelconque moment, vos yeux semblent trop fatigu\u00e9s pour continuer leurs t\u00e2ches, vous pourrez activer le syst\u00e8me de synth\u00e8se vocale et simplement \u00e9couter vos articles ! La fameuse application de prise de note et d\u2019organisation du travail a \u00e9galement eu droit \u00e0 sa version Apple Watch. Cette derni\u00e8re propose toutes les fonctionnalit\u00e9s pr\u00e9sentes sur celle du smartphone, avec bien entendu un syst\u00e8me vocal tr\u00e8s au point. Toutes vos notes et recherches seront automatiquement synchronis\u00e9es sur tous les autres appareils poss\u00e9dant l\u2019application. Bref, Evernote sur une smartwatch. Oublier son mot de passe fait partie des probl\u00e8mes du quotidien\u2026 1password a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 dans le but de supprimer cet incident souvent emb\u00eatant. En effet, cette application stocke toutes vos informations et vous permet, par la suite, de vous connecter en un simple clic ! Identifiants, carte de cr\u00e9dit ou notes s\u00e9curis\u00e9es, tout est enregistr\u00e9 puis utilis\u00e9 l\u00e0 o\u00f9 vous le souhaitez, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019il vous suffira de vous rendre sur le site qui vous int\u00e9resse, et l\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rera automatiquement les informations n\u00e9cessaires. Elle fait partie des applications Apple Watch qui chiffrent toutes vos donn\u00e9es gr\u00e2ce au chiffrement authentifi\u00e9 AES 256-bit, et prot\u00e8gent ces derni\u00e8res m\u00eame si votre appareil est perdu ou vol\u00e9. L\u2019option de Touch ID est \u00e9galement disponible. Sur l\u2019iPhone, \u201cJust Press Record\u201d une application tr\u00e8s efficace pour r\u00e9aliser des enregistrements rapides : appuyez sur le bouton d\u2019enregistrement, capturez de l\u2019audio, arr\u00eatez l\u2019enregistrement, et synchronisez tout \u00e7a directement sur votre Cloud. Avec watchOS 2, tout cela vient \u00e0 votre poignet, et vous pouvez enregistrer sans avoir votre iPhone \u00e0 port\u00e9e de main. Et en plus, la prochaine fois que vous vous connecterez, vos enregistrements seront transf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 votre iPhone. Sky Guide est une des applications Apple Watch les plus belles et les plus pr\u00e9cises de guides d\u2019\u00e9toiles et de constellations. L\u2019application compagnon vous donne un calendrier des \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e0 venir, et des notifications (facultatives) concernant ce qui est sur le point de se produire dans votre emplacement. Cette application est id\u00e9ale pour trouver rapidement des commerces de proximit\u00e9 par cat\u00e9gorie en appuyant sur un bouton : banque, bar, spa, zoo\u2026 Bref, tous les points d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat. L\u2019application permet m\u00eame d\u2019utiliser vos propres termes de recherche via Siri par contr\u00f4le vocal (actuellement de chose rare sur Apple Watch). Kitchen Stories est probablement la meilleure application Apple Watch \u00e0 poss\u00e9der pour tous les amoureux de cuisine, mais qui oublient souvent la liste de course elle offre la possibilit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er une liste de course directement depuis la montre. On peut ainsi cocher les ingr\u00e9dients que l\u2019on a d\u00e9j\u00e0, ou que l\u2019on ach\u00e8te, sans avoir besoin de sortir l\u2019iPhone. Et puis bien s\u00fbr, elle vous donne acc\u00e8s \u00e0 tout plein de recettes. C\u2019est b\u00eate, mais c\u2019est foutrement pratique. Trivial Crack est le jeu le plus t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9 au monde, il \u00e9tait donc logique qu\u2019elle rejoigne les applications Apple Watch. Comme sur iPhone, il est possible de jouer avec vos amis en les d\u00e9fiant dans diverses cat\u00e9gories : g\u00e9ographie, histoire, art, science, divertissement et sport. Mais dans ce jeu, les connaissances ne suffisent pas toujours, puisqu\u2019il faut savoir faire preuve d\u2019intelligence lors des duels, cela afin de grappiller des points suppl\u00e9mentaires. Rules! est une application de puzzle, avec une mini-jeu sp\u00e9cial qui la fait rentrer dans les applications Apple Watch. Il vous faudra atteindre des objectifs journaliers en r\u00e9alisant dix niveaux de jeu. Rules! s\u2019appuyant sur les couleurs, une aide pour les personnes souffrant de daltonisme a m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue !

Diff\u00e9rents jeux et exercices de 45 secondes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7us sp\u00e9cialement pour l\u2019inclure dans le catalogue des applications Apple Watch. Suivez vos performances et regardez vos points forts comme vos faiblesses, s\u2019am\u00e9liorer au fil des jours. Ce jeu, devenu un v\u00e9ritable best-seller des applications Apple Watch, pr\u00e9sente l\u2019histoire de l\u2019astronaute Taylor. Apr\u00e8s un atterrissage catastrophique, il se retrouve en situation de d\u00e9tresse sur une lune d\u00e9sol\u00e9e. Vous \u00eates la seule personne \u00e0 pouvoir communiquer avec lui via un syst\u00e8me de notification. Vous pourrez d\u00e9sormais r\u00e9pondre directement \u00e0 Taylor via votre Apple Watch, sans avoir n\u00e9cessairement besoin d\u2019une connexion internet. De plus il est possible de plonger dans les \u00e9v\u00e9nements ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 l\u2019histoire, afin de d\u00e9couvrir ce qui se passerait si vous effectuiez un choix diff\u00e9rent. Lifenine est un jeu ouvert et tr\u00e8s libre, cependant prenez bien en compte que chaque d\u00e9cision que vous prendrez, influencera sur la survie de l\u2019astronaute Taylor. Il s\u2019agit tout simplement de la version de 2048, mais pour Apple Watch. Vous pourrez par exemple commencer une partie chez vous sur votre smartphone, et la terminer dans les transports sur votre smartwatch. Plut\u00f4t pratique pour les amoureux de l\u2019application qui, au moindre moment de libert\u00e9, se pr\u00e9cipiteront sur leur montre pour jouer. Runeblade est un jeu con\u00e7u pour l\u2019Apple Watch sp\u00e9cifiquement, ce qui est assez rare pour le signaler. Le but est simple, traverser diff\u00e9rentes zones de jeux en se d\u00e9barrassant des ennemis que vous allez rencontrer. Vous gagnerez de l\u2019argent qu\u2019il faudra ensuite \u00e9changer contre diverses comp\u00e9tences. L\u2019application est \u00e9galement disponible sur iPhone, mais a surtout pour but de montrer l\u2019univers du jeu avant de vous y plonger sur la montre connect\u00e9e. Si vous \u00eates du genre \u00e0 oublier les d\u00e9tails importants (le mot de passe du WiFi, un nouveau num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone \u2026), Cheatsheet vous permet de faire une liste de petites notes pour les stocker sur votre Apple Watch. Chaque liste peut avoir son propre ic\u00f4ne, afin de les rendre plus facile \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre, et vous pouvez les configurer afin qu\u2019elles apparaissent sur l\u2019\u00e9cran principal de la montre. \u00a0 Un dictionnaire sur le poignet peut sembler \u00eatre une id\u00e9e saugrenue. Apr\u00e8s tout, pas besoin de ce genre d\u2019applications Apple Watch pour trouver l\u2019orthographe ou le sens d\u2019un mot. Cependant, l\u2019avantage principal de cette application est l\u2019utilisation du micro de la montre : vous pourrez, en effet, \u00e9noncer un mot pour le retrouver instantan\u00e9ment dans le dictionnaire. Un fois que le mot est entr\u00e9 dans le dictionnaire, vous pouvez acc\u00e9dez \u00e0 une d\u00e9finition et m\u00eame acc\u00e9der \u00e0 des synonymes. Par ailleurs, elle sera d\u2019une grande utilit\u00e9 aux amoureux de la langue qui souhaitent diversifier leur vocabulaire gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la fonction \u201cmot du jour\u201d. Reminders a mis du temps \u00e0 se frayer un chemin parmi les applications Apple Watch, malgr\u00e9 son succ\u00e8s sur iPhone. Mais elle est bien l\u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui, et ce depuis watchOS3. Bien qu\u2019elle soit en retard sur le march\u00e9 des montres connect\u00e9es,l\u2019application reste tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressante. Tout d\u2019abord, elle pr\u00e9sente les diff\u00e9rentes listes que vous cr\u00e9ez par ordre alphab\u00e9tique. Cela est bien plus pratique que l\u2019ordre arbitraire parfois dur \u00e0 comprendre de l\u2019application d\u2019Apple. Ensuite, vous pouvez utiliser l\u2019application pour ajouter ou modifier des objets. Ainsi, plus besoin de passer par votre iPhone pour cr\u00e9er de nouvelles listes ou ajouter des objets \u00e0 une liste pr\u00e9existante. L\u2019application de timer d\u2019Apple est tr\u00e8s facile \u00e0 utiliser, mais elle se limite seulement \u00e0 un minuteur. De plus, elle ne permet pas de mettre en place plusieurs chronom\u00e8tres en m\u00eame temps, sauf si vous achetez plusieurs Apple Watch, \u00e9videmment. MultiTimer se pr\u00e9sente comme un bien meilleur choix parmi les applications Apple Watch de timers. M\u00eame sous sa forme gratuite, l\u2019application propose six minuteurs. Elles s\u2019adaptent ensuite \u00e0 l\u2019affichagfe de la montre et s\u2019affichent sur son \u00e9cran principal. Vous pouvez en afficher autant que vous voulez selon les autres notifications pr\u00e9sentes. \u00a0 Avec l\u2019application de calendrier par d\u00e9faut d\u2019Apple, vous pouvez regarder vos rendez-vous sur votre montre. Fantastical 2 va plus loin en vous permettant d\u2019ajouter de nouveaux \u00e9v\u00e9nements sans passer par votre t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Cela se fait directement par commande vocale, rendant le processus on en peut plus simple. L\u2019application est optimis\u00e9e pour comprendre au mieux vos paroles, ce qui lui permettra de d\u00e9chiffrer facilement des commandes simples comme \u201cd\u00e9jeuner demain \u00e0 midi\u201d.",

It\u2019s represented by the unique collection of digital apps each customer assembles with their smart devices. The apps they use most frequently are also the most capable of delivering an outcome of value. For example, I use my Apple TV app to navigate AppleTV because I can never keep a separate remote handy, and navigation is easier using the app because it has a voice interface \u2013 so the app saves me time.

DXEs form around specific customer needs and desires. Forrester defines the customer experience (CX) ecosystem as the web of relations among all aspects of a company \u2014 including its customers, employees, partners, and operating environment \u2014 that determine the quality of the customer experience. The DXE represents both the digital products and services that customers use to achieve their outcomes and the digital operational elements of the CX ecosystem companies use to deliver value to customers.

While these apps are in my personal value ecosystem, they also form a broader digital experience ecosystem, working together to deliver the outcome \u2013 a great autocross day. Digital experience ecosystems constantly evolve \u2013 retail stores now offer banking services, airlines offer cruise vacations, agri-businesses offer advice on farm management. When evolving into a digital business, you must consider markets outside of your own immediate business \u2013 because the digital leader of those markets will not only shape your customer\u2019s expectations, they may well be competing with you very soon.</p> \n <p>Digital operations ecosystems increase operational agility in service of customers. Behind the scenes, businesses assemble myriad capabilities to support their business model \u2014 increasingly the digital components of such business capabilities integrate the business with other companies in the market to create an operational ecosystem, with each company dependent upon others for survival. While the ultimate focus of this ecosystem is creating customer value, it\u2019s more immediate effect is to drive operational agility in service of customers.

Keinen Anspruch haben Privatsender wie Radio 24 oder Radio Energy.</p> \n <p>Die SRG selber verteilt ihre Einnahmen nach dem Solidarit\u00e4tsprinzip: Obschon die Deutschschweiz rund 70 Prozent der Gesamtbev\u00f6lkerung ausmacht, erh\u00e4lt Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen von jedem Franken Einnahmen lediglich rund 43 Rappen. Der Rest geht in die franz\u00f6sische, italienische und r\u00e4toromanische Schweiz. Ohne Finanzausgleich m\u00fcssten Haushalte in der italienischsprachigen Schweiz rund 2300 Franken Billag-Geb\u00fchr pro Jahr bezahlen.</p> \n</div> \n<div> \n <p>Die SRG finanzierte sich 2016 zu rund 75 Prozent aus Geb\u00fchrengeldern: Aus dem Billag-Topf erhielt das Non-Profit-Unternehmen 1,24 Milliarden Franken, was mehr als das Doppelte von 1990 ist. Weitere 19 Prozent des Budgets stammen aus TV-Werbung und anderer kommerzieller T\u00e4tigkeit. 6 Prozent sind u\u0308brige Ertra\u0308ge, mehrheitlich Bundessubventionen fu\u0308r Programme des Auslandauftrags.</p> \n <h4>Steigende Einnahmen der SRG</h4> \n <h5>In Milliarden Franken, 1984\u20132016</h5> \n <p>Warum erhielt die SRG seit den 80ern Jahr f\u00fcr Jahr mehr Geb\u00fchrengelder? Die Anzahl Zahlender stieg dank dem Bev\u00f6lkerungswachstum von alleine. Zudem wurde die Billag-Geb\u00fchr in vielen Schritten erh\u00f6ht. Das Geld wurde von der SRG in den 90er-Jahren in zus\u00e4tzliche Sender (Radio Virus, Spartenkan\u00e4le, Swiss Info, SRF 2, SRF Info, Schweiz 4, S+ etc.), den digitalen Wandel, Sportrechte sowie in Eigenproduktionen wie den \u00abBestatter\u00bb, \u00abDie gr\u00f6ssten Schweizer Talente\u00bb oder \u00abGotthard\u00bb investiert. Im Gegensatz zu den Geb\u00fchreneinnahmen gingen die kommerziellen Ertr\u00e4ge in den letzten Jahren stark zur\u00fcck. Gr\u00fcnde: Frankenst\u00e4rke, ausl\u00e4ndische TV-Werbefenster und Konkurrenz durch digitale Werbeplattformen (Google, Facebook), welche die klassische Fernsehwerbung teilweise ersetzen. Kommt erschwerend hinzu: Die SRG darf im Onlinebereich und im Radio keine Werbung machen. Ab 2019 wird der SRG-Anteil an den Billag-Geb\u00fchren auf 1,2 Mrd. Fr. pro Jahr begrenzt und nur noch an die Teuerung angepasst \u2013 so will es das revidierte RTVG. Die SRG muss ein Sparpaket von 50 Millionen Franken schn\u00fcren.</p> \n</div> \n<div> \n <p>Den Vorwurf h\u00f6rt man oft: Die SRG gebe zu viel Geb\u00fchrengelder f\u00fcr \u00abseichte\u00bb Unterhaltungsformate wie \u00abGlanz &amp; Gloria\u00bb, Mainstream-TV-Serien und Allerwelts-Shows aus statt f\u00fcr relevante Informationen, Kultur, Brauchtum, Bildung und Wissenschaft.

Seitens der SRG heisst es dann: Falsch, man habe in den letzten 15 oder 20 Jahren keinen einzigen Sender er\u00f6ffnet. Zumindest damit hat die SRG recht. Die 24 Radio- und Fernsehsender und drei weitere Plattformen, die aktuell im Betrieb sind, wurden bis auf zwei Ausnahmen (Radio SRF 4 News, RTS Info) alle vor der Jahrhundertwende lanciert. Die Radiosender der ersten Programmketten stammen aus den 30er-Jahren, das Fernsehen startete in den 50ern. Bis in die 80er-Jahre blieb die Radio- und TV-Landschaft unver\u00e4ndert; 1983 liberalisierte der Bundesrat das Mediengesetz: Private und kommerzielle Lokalradios wurden erlaubt. Die SRG f\u00fchrt als Reaktion die dritte Programmkette f\u00fcr ein jugendliches Publikum ein. Der gr\u00f6sste Ausbau erfolgte zwischen 1995 und 2000. Es wurden Radiospartenprogramme, zweite und dritte TV-Senderketten und eine Onlineplattform lanciert. Die Expansion trieb vor allem der damalige SRG-Generaldirektor Armin Walpen an. Heute ist die SRG mit einem Jahresumsatz von 1,6 Milliarden Franken das mit Abstand gr\u00f6sste Medienunternehmen der Schweiz.</p> \n <h4>So wuchs die SRG auf 27 Sendegef\u00e4sse</h4> \n <h5>1930\u20132017</h5> \n</div> \n<div> \n <p>Dem Grundgedanken des Service public entsprechend, hat die \u00d6ffentlichkeit \u2013 nicht der Staat \u2013 die Kosten f\u00fcr den \u00f6ffentlichen Rundfunk zu decken. In den meisten L\u00e4ndern Europas wird das \u00f6ffentliche Fernsehen und Radio gr\u00f6sstenteils \u00fcber Geb\u00fchren finanziert. Deutschland f\u00fchrte 2013 als erstes Land in Europa eine Haushaltsabgabe ein, die vom Ger\u00e4tebesitz unabh\u00e4ngig ist. Diesem Modell folgt die Schweiz im kommenden Jahr, die Geb\u00fchr betr\u00e4gt 451 Franken. Ab 2019 bezahlen die Privathaushalte eine Abgabe von 365 Franken.</p> \n <p>Im europ\u00e4ischen Vergleich bezahlen die Schweizer die h\u00f6chsten Rundfunkgeb\u00fchren. In Deutschland zum Beispiel betr\u00e4gt die j\u00e4hrliche Haushaltsabgabe 227 Franken.</p> \n <h4>Rundfunkgeb\u00fchren im Vergleich</h4> \n <h5>J\u00e4hrliche Geb\u00fchren pro Haushalt in Franken, 2017</h5> \n <p>W\u00e4re die Schweiz ein einsprachiges Land, w\u00fcrde eine Geb\u00fchr von knapp 270 Franken reichen, wie eine schon etwas \u00e4ltere <a href=\"https://www.efk.admin.ch/images/stories/efk_dokumente/publikationen/evaluationen/Evaluationen%20%2812%29/5284_SRG-Bericht_de.pdf\">Untersuchung von 2006</a> der eidgen\u00f6ssischen Finanzkontrolle zeigte.

Eine Publicom-Studie von 2015 weist diesen Vergleich in kaufkraftbereinigten Werten, normiert auf die Kaufkraftparit\u00e4t der Schweiz, aus.</p> \n <h4>Einnahmen aus Geb\u00fchren pro Kopf</h4> \n <h5>Kaufkraftbereinigt in Franken, 2015</h5> \n <p>Im europ\u00e4ischen Vergleich erh\u00e4lt die SRG \u2013 bezogen auf die Einwohnerzahl \u2013 nach den deutschen Rundfunkanstalten die zweith\u00f6chsten Aufwendungen aus \u00f6ffentlichen T\u00f6pfen. Die H\u00f6he der Abgaben ist gerade in kleineren L\u00e4ndern relativ hoch. Dies ist unter anderem mit der Fixkostendegression im Medienmarkt zu erkl\u00e4ren. In bev\u00f6lkerungsstarken L\u00e4ndern verteilen sich die hohen Fixkosten (Infrastruktur und Personal) auf mehr Personen und Haushalte, sodass die Geb\u00fchren dort niedriger sind.</p> \n</div> \n<div> \n <p>Tagesaktuelle SRF-Infosendungen wie \u00abSchweiz aktuell\u00bb, \u00abTagesschau\u00ab oder \u00ab10vor10\u00bb dominieren den Anteil der Programmstatistik von SRF 1.

Eigentlich noch immer stolze Zahlen f\u00fcr die SRF-Sender. Allerdings zeigt sich im Langzeitvergleich: Seit 2000 verloren sie rund 600\u2019000 Zuschauer des Tagespublikums. Die Schweizer Privaten verloren 334\u2019000. Und das bei gleichbleibendem Gesamtpublikum: 1994 sowie 2016 schalteten 3,4 Millionen Deutschschweizer (fast 65 Prozent) mindestens einmal pro Tag ein TV-Ger\u00e4t an \u2013 nur schauen sie heute weniger lang und nutzen immer mehr Pay-TV. Die Mediapulse-Kategorie Playback, Games, DVD (Pay-TV, Teleclub, VoD, Apple-TV, Netflix etc.) legte von 505\u2019000 Nutzern pro Tag im Jahr 2000 auf 1,83 Millionen im Jahr 2016 zu. Im Schnitt schauten die SRF-Zuschauer im Jahr 2000 rund 45 Minuten lang das heimische Programm, 2016 waren es noch 38 Minuten.</p> \n <h4>Zuschauer pro Tag in der Deutschschweiz</h4> \n <h5>In Millionen, 2000\u20132016</h5> \n <p>Der Zuschauerschwund zeigt sich auch in einzelnen Sendungen auf SRF 1: So verlor die \u00abTagesschau\u00bb-Hauptausgabe zwischen 2011 und 2016 fast 100\u2019000 Zuschauer. Dennoch: Fast jeder zweite Deutschschweizer Fernsehzuschauer hat im abgelaufenen Jahr die Hauptausgabe der \u00abTagesschau\u00bb mindestens einmal gesehen. Sie erreicht t\u00e4glich immer noch rund 600\u2019000 Personen.</p> \n <p>Schaut man sich die Marktanteile in der Deutschschweiz an, konnten sich die SRF-Sender in den letzten 20 Jahren behaupten \u2013 zumindest als Gruppe. Jedoch wird hier im Gegensatz zum Radio deutlich: Die Schweiz guckt fremd. Und dieser Trend akzentuierte sich \u00fcber die vergangenen Jahre nochmals leicht. So sank der Marktanteil der SRF-Sender (als Gruppe) von 33 Prozent (2000) auf 31 Prozent (2016) \u2013 bei einem Zwischenhoch von 35 Prozent im Jahr 2006. Der Marktanteil der ausl\u00e4ndischen Sender stieg im selben Zeitraum von 60 Prozent auf 61 Prozent. Nichtsdestotrotz: Der SRG-Flaggschiff-Sender SRF 1 blieb mit einem Marktanteil von 19 Prozent mit Abstand der beliebteste Sender der Deutschschweiz, musste aber in den letzten Jahren einige Prozentpunkte Federn lassen.</p> \n <h4>TV-Marktanteile in der Deutschschweiz</h4> \n <h5>2000\u20132016</h5> \n <p>Kommen wir zu den Zuschauerzahlen einzelner TV-Sendungen. Quotenk\u00f6nig war 2016 der Film \u00abGotthard\u00bb. Die beiden Teile erreichten im Schnitt knapp eine Million Zuschauer. Es war der teuerste Schweizer Film \u00fcberhaupt. In ihm stecken 5,73 Millionen Franken Geb\u00fchrengelder. Insgesamt kostet \u00abGotthard\u00bb, eine Co-Produktion der Schweiz mit Deutschland und \u00d6sterreich, 11 Millionen Franken.

Zum Vergleich: Das Durchschnittsalter der Schweizer Bev\u00f6lkerung liegt bei rund 42 Jahren (2016), jenes des generellen Fernsehpublikums bei 52 Jahren. Besonders skurril: Selbst die Zambo-Jugendsendungen weisen ein Durchschnittsalter von \u00fcber 50 Jahren aus. Die mit Abstand j\u00fcngste SRF-Sendung ist das \u00abGuetnachtgschichtli\u00bb: Durchschnittsalter 40,4 Jahre.</p> \n <h4>Durchschnittsalter ausgew\u00e4hlter SRF 1-Sendungen</h4> \n <h5>2016</h5> \n</div> \n<div> \n <p>Im Zeitalter von Social Media h\u00f6rt niemand mehr Radio? Mitnichten. 86 Prozent der Deutschschweizer schalten es an einem durchschnittlichen Tag mindestens einmal ein. Vor zehn Jahren waren es sogar noch 91 Prozent. Fast zwei Stunden l\u00e4uft das Radio heute im Schnitt \u2013 mit Abstand am beliebtesten sind SRG-Programme.</p> \n <h4>Radio-Marktanteile in der Deutschschweiz</h4> \n <h5>2003\u20132017</h5> \n <p>Der Markt wird von der SRG dominiert. In der Deutschschweiz schalten pro Tag \u00fcber 2,9 Millionen Personen deren Sender ein. Zusammen erreichten die SRG-Programme in der ersten H\u00e4lfte dieses Jahres 63,7 Prozent Marktanteil. Alle Schweizer Privatradiosender zusammen kamen auf 31,6 Prozent, obwohl auch sie t\u00e4glich knapp 2,6 Millionen H\u00f6rer verzeichnen. Der Unterschied liegt in der H\u00f6rdauer: SRG-Sender laufen durchschnittlich gut 105 Minuten, Private nur knapp 59 Minuten, weshalb der Marktanteil kleiner ist. Ausl\u00e4ndische Programme spielen mit immerhin 1,3 Millionen H\u00f6rern pro Tag aber nur 18 Minuten H\u00f6rdauer eine untergeordnete Rolle (4,7 Prozent Marktanteil).</p> \n <h4>Marktanteile der SRF-Radiosender in der Deutschschweiz</h4> \n <h5>2003\u20132017</h5> \n <p>Die Dominanz der SRG in der Deutschschweiz hat vor allem mit zwei Sendern zu tun: SRF 1 alleine hat am Tag 1,53 Millionen H\u00f6rer (30,3 Prozent Marktanteil), bei SRF 3 sind es 1,2 Millionen (16,1 Prozent). Andere SRG-Sender sind im Vergleich dazu Nischenprodukte. So kommt SRF 4 News mit 235\u2019000 H\u00f6rern auf 0,8 Prozent. Und SRF Virus mit 100\u2019000 H\u00f6rern sogar nur auf 0,3 Prozent Marktanteil. Das hat auch mit der Altersverteilung der SRF-H\u00f6rerschaft zu tun. 30,1 Prozent sind \u00fcber 60 Jahre alt. Dennoch wird Radio l\u00e4ngst nicht nur von Rentnern geh\u00f6rt. Mehr als ein Viertel der H\u00f6rer sind unter 34, bei gut 11 Prozent handelt es sich gar um 15- bis 24-J\u00e4hrige.</p> \n</div> \n<div> \n <p>In der aktuellen No-Billag-Debatte wird viel \u00fcber das Programm und die Rolle der SRG gen\u00f6rgelt.

        "text": "Seit 1997 treibt die Billag im Auftrag des Bundes die Geb\u00fchren f\u00fcr Radio- und Fernsehnutzung ein. Die Geb\u00fchr ist kontinuierlich angestiegen, besonders stark zwischen 1990 und 1995. Heute betr\u00e4gt sie 451.10 Franken \u2013 das sind 61,3 Prozent mehr als noch 1990 (279.60 Franken). Die Teuerungsrate stieg im gleichen Zeitraum um 29 Prozent. Entwicklung der Radio- und TV-Geb\u00fchr In Franken, seit 1987 Die Erh\u00f6hung um 4,1 Prozent im Jahr 2003 kompensierte die Ausf\u00e4lle durch die Geb\u00fchrenbefreiung der Bez\u00fcger von AHV- und IV-Erg\u00e4nzungsleistungen. Die Mehreinnahmen im Jahr 2007 gingen an die privaten Anbieter. Was \u00e4ndert sich mit dem revidierten Radio- und Fernsehgesetz (RTVG)? Ab 2019 werden die Rechnungen an alle Haushalte geschickt, unabh\u00e4ngig davon, ob jemand Ger\u00e4te besitzt oder nicht. Weil alle bezahlen, wird der Betrag pro Haushalt auf 365 Franken sinken. Insgesamt werden die Billag-Einnahmen mit der neuen Abgabe ungef\u00e4hr gleich hoch bleiben. K\u00fcnftig werden mehr Haushalte und Firmen zahlungspflichtig. Gegenw\u00e4rtig zahlen 35\u2019000 Unternehmen die Billag-Geb\u00fchr, bald sind es \u00fcber 100\u2019000. Ab 2019 treibt neu die Firma Serafe die Geb\u00fchren ein, nicht mehr die Billag. Insgesamt trieb die Billag 2016 rund 1,37 Milliarden Franken ein. Mit rund 90 Prozent am meisten davon fliesst zur SRG (1,24 Mrd. Fr.). Aus den Geb\u00fchren wird aber auch die Billag selber finanziert (55,4 Millionen). Die 34 privaten Radio- und TV-Stationen erhalten aus dem Topf nur unwesentlich mehr: 61 Millionen. Ab 2019 sollen sie neu immerhin 81 Millionen Franken erhalten, so steht es im teilrevidierten RTVG. Der Billag-Nachfolger Serafe muss k\u00fcnftig mit 18 Millionen Franken pro Jahr f\u00fcr die Inkasso-Aufgabe auskommen. So werden die Geb\u00fchrengelder verteilt In Millionen Franken pro Jahr, 2016 Welche der Privaten haben Anspruch auf die Billag-Millionen? Es sind Lokalradios in Berg- und Randregionen, nicht gewinnorientierte Lokalradios sowie Regionalfernseh-Stationen. Sie erhalten erst seit 2007 einen Anteil der Geb\u00fchren. Keinen Anspruch haben Privatsender wie Radio 24 oder Radio Energy. Die SRG selber verteilt ihre Einnahmen nach dem Solidarit\u00e4tsprinzip: Obschon die Deutschschweiz rund 70 Prozent der Gesamtbev\u00f6lkerung ausmacht, erh\u00e4lt Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen von jedem Franken Einnahmen lediglich rund 43 Rappen. Der Rest geht in die franz\u00f6sische, italienische und r\u00e4toromanische Schweiz. Ohne Finanzausgleich m\u00fcssten Haushalte in der italienischsprachigen Schweiz rund 2300 Franken Billag-Geb\u00fchr pro Jahr bezahlen. Die SRG finanzierte sich 2016 zu rund 75 Prozent aus Geb\u00fchrengeldern: Aus dem Billag-Topf erhielt das Non-Profit-Unternehmen 1,24 Milliarden Franken, was mehr als das Doppelte von 1990 ist. Weitere 19 Prozent des Budgets stammen aus TV-Werbung und anderer kommerzieller T\u00e4tigkeit. 6 Prozent sind u\u0308brige Ertra\u0308ge, mehrheitlich Bundessubventionen fu\u0308r Programme des Auslandauftrags. Steigende Einnahmen der SRG In Milliarden Franken, 1984\u20132016 Warum erhielt die SRG seit den 80ern Jahr f\u00fcr Jahr mehr Geb\u00fchrengelder? Die Anzahl Zahlender stieg dank dem Bev\u00f6lkerungswachstum von alleine. Zudem wurde die Billag-Geb\u00fchr in vielen Schritten erh\u00f6ht. Das Geld wurde von der SRG in den 90er-Jahren in zus\u00e4tzliche Sender (Radio Virus, Spartenkan\u00e4le, Swiss Info, SRF 2, SRF Info, Schweiz 4, S+ etc.), den digitalen Wandel, Sportrechte sowie in Eigenproduktionen wie den \u00abBestatter\u00bb, \u00abDie gr\u00f6ssten Schweizer Talente\u00bb oder \u00abGotthard\u00bb investiert. Im Gegensatz zu den Geb\u00fchreneinnahmen gingen die kommerziellen Ertr\u00e4ge in den letzten Jahren stark zur\u00fcck. Gr\u00fcnde: Frankenst\u00e4rke, ausl\u00e4ndische TV-Werbefenster und Konkurrenz durch digitale Werbeplattformen (Google, Facebook), welche die klassische Fernsehwerbung teilweise ersetzen. Kommt erschwerend hinzu: Die SRG darf im Onlinebereich und im Radio keine Werbung machen. Ab 2019 wird der SRG-Anteil an den Billag-Geb\u00fchren auf 1,2 Mrd. Fr. pro Jahr begrenzt und nur noch an die Teuerung angepasst \u2013 so will es das revidierte RTVG. Die SRG muss ein Sparpaket von 50 Millionen Franken schn\u00fcren. Den Vorwurf h\u00f6rt man oft: Die SRG gebe zu viel Geb\u00fchrengelder f\u00fcr \u00abseichte\u00bb Unterhaltungsformate wie \u00abGlanz & Gloria\u00bb, Mainstream-TV-Serien und Allerwelts-Shows aus statt f\u00fcr relevante Informationen, Kultur, Brauchtum, Bildung und Wissenschaft. So sieht die Realit\u00e4t aus: Ausgaben der SRG (Radio und TV) nach Sparten In Franken, 2016 2016 kam eine Studie der Freien Universit\u00e4t Berlin zum Schluss, dass das Programm der SRG deutlich weniger politische Themen beinhaltet, verglichen mit deutschen \u00f6ffentlich-rechtlichen Sendern. Die Erkl\u00e4rung der SRG damals: das bescheidene Budget. Alleine die deutsche ARD verf\u00fcge \u00fcber 8,4 Milliarden Franken und produziere an einem Tag bis zu zw\u00f6lf Nachrichtensendungen. Die SRG setzt auf Schweizer Eigenproduktionen in Radio, TV und Online. 2016 verwendete sie 85 Prozent ihrer Ausgaben f\u00fcr Produktionen, welche die Unternehmenseinheiten selbst herstellen. Der gr\u00f6sste Kostenfaktor ist der Personalaufwand: Er machte 41,3 Prozent (666,6 Millionen Franken) des gesamten Betriebsaufwandes aus (mehr zu den L\u00f6hnen der SRG-Mitarbeiter). Ausgew\u00e4hlte Kostenbl\u00f6cke F\u00fcr das Gesch\u00e4ftsjahr 2016 Bei der SRG betr\u00e4gt der durchschnittliche Brutto-Jahreslohn 107\u2019354 Franken (2016). Bei einem Durchschnittsalter von 45 Jahren erscheint das als eher hoch. Der Grund: Die rund 6000 Mitarbeiter sind gut ausgebildet: 42 Prozent haben einen Hochschul- oder Fachhochschulabschluss, bei den Journalisten sind es 65 Prozent.

Der gr\u00f6sste Teil des Personals untersteht einem komfortablen Gesamtarbeitsvertrag. SRG-Mitarbeitende mit 100%-Pensum m\u00fcssen keine Billag-Geb\u00fchren zahlen und haben Anspruch auf 5,4 Wochen Ferien im Jahr. Der tiefste Jahreslohn betrug vergangenes Jahr 52\u2019000 Franken, der h\u00f6chste 536\u2019314 Franken. Das entspricht einem Verh\u00e4ltnis von 1 zu 10,3. F\u00fcr das Gesch\u00e4ftsjahr 2016 erhielt Roger de Weck 536\u2019314 Franken (Vorjahr 557\u2019434 Fr.). De Weck ist diesen Herbst zur\u00fcckgetreten. Mit diesem Gehalt (Fixlohn inkl.

Immer mehr Sender, Gef\u00e4sse, Werbem\u00f6glichkeiten und die Expansion ins Internet: Ein Hauptargument der SRG-Kritiker ist der stete Ausbau. Seitens der SRG heisst es dann: Falsch, man habe in den letzten 15 oder 20 Jahren keinen einzigen Sender er\u00f6ffnet. Zumindest damit hat die SRG recht. Die 24 Radio- und Fernsehsender und drei weitere Plattformen, die aktuell im Betrieb sind, wurden bis auf zwei Ausnahmen (Radio SRF 4 News, RTS Info) alle vor der Jahrhundertwende lanciert. Die Radiosender der ersten Programmketten stammen aus den 30er-Jahren, das Fernsehen startete in den 50ern. Bis in die 80er-Jahre blieb die Radio- und TV-Landschaft unver\u00e4ndert; 1983 liberalisierte der Bundesrat das Mediengesetz: Private und kommerzielle Lokalradios wurden erlaubt. Die SRG f\u00fchrt als Reaktion die dritte Programmkette f\u00fcr ein jugendliches Publikum ein. Der gr\u00f6sste Ausbau erfolgte zwischen 1995 und 2000. Es wurden Radiospartenprogramme, zweite und dritte TV-Senderketten und eine Onlineplattform lanciert. Die Expansion trieb vor allem der damalige SRG-Generaldirektor Armin Walpen an. Heute ist die SRG mit einem Jahresumsatz von 1,6 Milliarden Franken das mit Abstand gr\u00f6sste Medienunternehmen der Schweiz. So wuchs die SRG auf 27 Sendegef\u00e4sse 1930\u20132017 Dem Grundgedanken des Service public entsprechend, hat die \u00d6ffentlichkeit \u2013 nicht der Staat \u2013 die Kosten f\u00fcr den \u00f6ffentlichen Rundfunk zu decken. In den meisten L\u00e4ndern Europas wird das \u00f6ffentliche Fernsehen und Radio gr\u00f6sstenteils \u00fcber Geb\u00fchren finanziert. Deutschland f\u00fchrte 2013 als erstes Land in Europa eine Haushaltsabgabe ein, die vom Ger\u00e4tebesitz unabh\u00e4ngig ist. Diesem Modell folgt die Schweiz im kommenden Jahr, die Geb\u00fchr betr\u00e4gt 451 Franken. Ab 2019 bezahlen die Privathaushalte eine Abgabe von 365 Franken. Im europ\u00e4ischen Vergleich bezahlen die Schweizer die h\u00f6chsten Rundfunkgeb\u00fchren. In Deutschland zum Beispiel betr\u00e4gt die j\u00e4hrliche Haushaltsabgabe 227 Franken. Rundfunkgeb\u00fchren im Vergleich J\u00e4hrliche Geb\u00fchren pro Haushalt in Franken, 2017 W\u00e4re die Schweiz ein einsprachiges Land, w\u00fcrde eine Geb\u00fchr von knapp 270 Franken reichen, wie eine schon etwas \u00e4ltere Untersuchung von 2006 der eidgen\u00f6ssischen Finanzkontrolle zeigte. Das heisst: Die Viersprachigkeit kostet rund 42 Prozent der Geb\u00fchren. Vergleichen lassen sich die \u00f6ffentlichen Rundfunkanstalten Europas auch bei den Einnahmen aus \u00f6ffentlichen Mitteln (Geb\u00fchren und/oder Haushaltsgelder) pro Kopf der Bev\u00f6lkerung. Eine Publicom-Studie von 2015 weist diesen Vergleich in kaufkraftbereinigten Werten, normiert auf die Kaufkraftparit\u00e4t der Schweiz, aus. Einnahmen aus Geb\u00fchren pro Kopf Kaufkraftbereinigt in Franken, 2015 Im europ\u00e4ischen Vergleich erh\u00e4lt die SRG \u2013 bezogen auf die Einwohnerzahl \u2013 nach den deutschen Rundfunkanstalten die zweith\u00f6chsten Aufwendungen aus \u00f6ffentlichen T\u00f6pfen. Die H\u00f6he der Abgaben ist gerade in kleineren L\u00e4ndern relativ hoch. Dies ist unter anderem mit der Fixkostendegression im Medienmarkt zu erkl\u00e4ren. In bev\u00f6lkerungsstarken L\u00e4ndern verteilen sich die hohen Fixkosten (Infrastruktur und Personal) auf mehr Personen und Haushalte, sodass die Geb\u00fchren dort niedriger sind. Tagesaktuelle SRF-Infosendungen wie \u00abSchweiz aktuell\u00bb, \u00abTagesschau\u00ab oder \u00ab10vor10\u00bb dominieren den Anteil der Programmstatistik von SRF 1. Wir haben das gesamte Programm des SRG-Hauptsenders auf 30 Sekunden heruntergebrochen: Das TV-Programm von SRF 1 in 30 Sekunden Gem\u00e4ss Programmstatistik 2016 So sieht die Statistik f\u00fcr SRF 2 aus. Dort dominieren Filme, Serien und Sport: Programmstatistik SRF zwei 2016 SRF 1, SRF 2 und SRF info erreichten 2016 rund 2,4 Millionen Zuschauer in der Deutschschweiz t\u00e4glich. Zum Vergleich: Die 23 Schweizer Privatsender sahen zusammen pro Tag 1,4 Millionen Personen. ARD schauten t\u00e4glich 846\u2019000 Deutschschweizer, RTL 812\u2019000. Eigentlich noch immer stolze Zahlen f\u00fcr die SRF-Sender. Allerdings zeigt sich im Langzeitvergleich: Seit 2000 verloren sie rund 600\u2019000 Zuschauer des Tagespublikums. Die Schweizer Privaten verloren 334\u2019000. Und das bei gleichbleibendem Gesamtpublikum: 1994 sowie 2016 schalteten 3,4 Millionen Deutschschweizer (fast 65 Prozent) mindestens einmal pro Tag ein TV-Ger\u00e4t an \u2013 nur schauen sie heute weniger lang und nutzen immer mehr Pay-TV. Die Mediapulse-Kategorie Playback, Games, DVD (Pay-TV, Teleclub, VoD, Apple-TV, Netflix etc.) legte von 505\u2019000 Nutzern pro Tag im Jahr 2000 auf 1,83 Millionen im Jahr 2016 zu. Im Schnitt schauten die SRF-Zuschauer im Jahr 2000 rund 45 Minuten lang das heimische Programm, 2016 waren es noch 38 Minuten. Zuschauer pro Tag in der Deutschschweiz In Millionen, 2000\u20132016 Der Zuschauerschwund zeigt sich auch in einzelnen Sendungen auf SRF 1: So verlor die \u00abTagesschau\u00bb-Hauptausgabe zwischen 2011 und 2016 fast 100\u2019000 Zuschauer. Dennoch: Fast jeder zweite Deutschschweizer Fernsehzuschauer hat im abgelaufenen Jahr die Hauptausgabe der \u00abTagesschau\u00bb mindestens einmal gesehen. Sie erreicht t\u00e4glich immer noch rund 600\u2019000 Personen. Schaut man sich die Marktanteile in der Deutschschweiz an, konnten sich die SRF-Sender in den letzten 20 Jahren behaupten \u2013 zumindest als Gruppe. Jedoch wird hier im Gegensatz zum Radio deutlich: Die Schweiz guckt fremd. Und dieser Trend akzentuierte sich \u00fcber die vergangenen Jahre nochmals leicht. So sank der Marktanteil der SRF-Sender (als Gruppe) von 33 Prozent (2000) auf 31 Prozent (2016) \u2013 bei einem Zwischenhoch von 35 Prozent im Jahr 2006. Der Marktanteil der ausl\u00e4ndischen Sender stieg im selben Zeitraum von 60 Prozent auf 61 Prozent. Nichtsdestotrotz: Der SRG-Flaggschiff-Sender SRF 1 blieb mit einem Marktanteil von 19 Prozent mit Abstand der beliebteste Sender der Deutschschweiz, musste aber in den letzten Jahren einige Prozentpunkte Federn lassen. TV-Marktanteile in der Deutschschweiz 2000\u20132016 Kommen wir zu den Zuschauerzahlen einzelner TV-Sendungen. Quotenk\u00f6nig war 2016 der Film \u00abGotthard\u00bb. Die beiden Teile erreichten im Schnitt knapp eine Million Zuschauer. Es war der teuerste Schweizer Film \u00fcberhaupt. In ihm stecken 5,73 Millionen Franken Geb\u00fchrengelder. Insgesamt kostet \u00abGotthard\u00bb, eine Co-Produktion der Schweiz mit Deutschland und \u00d6sterreich, 11 Millionen Franken. Auch der \u00abBestatter\u00bb, \u00abHappy Day\u00bb und die \u00abTagesschau\u00bb sind Zuschauermagnete. Auf der anderen Seite der Tabelle liegt die Sendung \u00abKulturzeit\u00bb, sie wird im Schnitt nur von 4000 Personen geschaut. Auch die \u00abSternstunde\u00bb-Sendungen und \u00abDeville\u00bb bleiben Nische.

Das Durchschnittsalter der SRF-1-Zuschauer betr\u00e4gt insgesamt 60,8 Jahre, jenes der SRF-2-Zuschauer 52,9 Jahre. Zum Vergleich: Das Durchschnittsalter der Schweizer Bev\u00f6lkerung liegt bei rund 42 Jahren (2016), jenes des generellen Fernsehpublikums bei 52 Jahren. Besonders skurril: Selbst die Zambo-Jugendsendungen weisen ein Durchschnittsalter von \u00fcber 50 Jahren aus. Die mit Abstand j\u00fcngste SRF-Sendung ist das \u00abGuetnachtgschichtli\u00bb: Durchschnittsalter 40,4 Jahre. Durchschnittsalter ausgew\u00e4hlter SRF 1-Sendungen 2016 Im Zeitalter von Social Media h\u00f6rt niemand mehr Radio? Mitnichten. 86 Prozent der Deutschschweizer schalten es an einem durchschnittlichen Tag mindestens einmal ein. Vor zehn Jahren waren es sogar noch 91 Prozent. Fast zwei Stunden l\u00e4uft das Radio heute im Schnitt \u2013 mit Abstand am beliebtesten sind SRG-Programme. Radio-Marktanteile in der Deutschschweiz 2003\u20132017 Der Markt wird von der SRG dominiert. In der Deutschschweiz schalten pro Tag \u00fcber 2,9 Millionen Personen deren Sender ein. Zusammen erreichten die SRG-Programme in der ersten H\u00e4lfte dieses Jahres 63,7 Prozent Marktanteil. Alle Schweizer Privatradiosender zusammen kamen auf 31,6 Prozent, obwohl auch sie t\u00e4glich knapp 2,6 Millionen H\u00f6rer verzeichnen. Der Unterschied liegt in der H\u00f6rdauer: SRG-Sender laufen durchschnittlich gut 105 Minuten, Private nur knapp 59 Minuten, weshalb der Marktanteil kleiner ist. Ausl\u00e4ndische Programme spielen mit immerhin 1,3 Millionen H\u00f6rern pro Tag aber nur 18 Minuten H\u00f6rdauer eine untergeordnete Rolle (4,7 Prozent Marktanteil). Marktanteile der SRF-Radiosender in der Deutschschweiz 2003\u20132017 Die Dominanz der SRG in der Deutschschweiz hat vor allem mit zwei Sendern zu tun: SRF 1 alleine hat am Tag 1,53 Millionen H\u00f6rer (30,3 Prozent Marktanteil), bei SRF 3 sind es 1,2 Millionen (16,1 Prozent). Andere SRG-Sender sind im Vergleich dazu Nischenprodukte. So kommt SRF 4 News mit 235\u2019000 H\u00f6rern auf 0,8 Prozent. Und SRF Virus mit 100\u2019000 H\u00f6rern sogar nur auf 0,3 Prozent Marktanteil. Das hat auch mit der Altersverteilung der SRF-H\u00f6rerschaft zu tun. 30,1 Prozent sind \u00fcber 60 Jahre alt. Dennoch wird Radio l\u00e4ngst nicht nur von Rentnern geh\u00f6rt. Mehr als ein Viertel der H\u00f6rer sind unter 34, bei gut 11 Prozent handelt es sich gar um 15- bis 24-J\u00e4hrige. In der aktuellen No-Billag-Debatte wird viel \u00fcber das Programm und die Rolle der SRG gen\u00f6rgelt. Doch in Umfragen und Studien schneidet das Unternehmen gut ab. Die Uni St. Gallen hat 14'500 Personen dazu befragt, welchen Beitrag die f\u00fchrenden privaten und staatlichen Unternehmen zum Gemeinwohl leisten. Die SRG landete im \u00abGemeinwohl-Atlas\u00bb 2017 auf Platz 18, deutlich vor allen anderen Medientiteln wie der NZZ (Rang 30), dem \u00abTages-Anzeiger\u00bb (42), \u00ab20 Minuten\u00bb (88) oder dem \u00abBlick\u00bb (103). In den letzten beiden Jahren hat sich das Image der SRG gem\u00e4ss dieser Erhebung sogar noch verbessert. Eine Umfrage im Auftrag des Bundesamts f\u00fcr Kommunikation (Bakom) hat ergeben, dass die Bev\u00f6lkerung die Angebote der SRG den Privaten vorzieht. Die Radiosender des Unternehmens erzielten in den Kategorien \u00abProfessionalit\u00e4t\u00bb, \u00abGlaubw\u00fcrdigkeit\u00bb und \u00abInformationsgehalt\u00bb die besten Werte. Dieselben St\u00e4rken, wenn auch mit weniger Punkten gew\u00fcrdigt, haben laut den Befragten auch die TV-Sender der SRG. Gem\u00e4ss einer im vergangenen September ver\u00f6ffentlichten Studie des Medienberatungsunternehmens Publicom sind die SRG und die NZZ die glaubw\u00fcrdigsten Medien. In der Deutschschweiz vertrauen die Nutzer der NZZ am meisten, in der Westschweiz und im Tessin den Radioprogrammen der SRG. \u00dcberraschend ist dabei laut Publicom, dass diese Einsch\u00e4tzungen unabh\u00e4ngig vom Alter der Befragten geteilt werden. Nicht nur beim Publikum, sondern auch bei Experten kommt die SRG mit ihrem Programm gut an. F\u00fcr das \u00abMedienqualit\u00e4tsrating 2016\u00bb analysierten Forscher 18\u2018000 redaktionelle Beitr\u00e4ge aller wichtigen Schweizer Zeitungen, Onlinemedien, Radio- und TV-Sendungen. Die h\u00f6chste Berichterstattungsqualit\u00e4t erzielten die SRG-Sendungen \u00abEcho der Zeit\u00bb, \u00abLe 12h30\u00bb und \u00abRendez-vous\u00bb. Sechs der ersten zehn Pl\u00e4tze des Rankings belegten SRG-Sendungen. Das \u00abJahrbuch Qualit\u00e4t der Medien 2017\u00bb des Forschungsinstituts \u00d6ffentlichkeit und Gesellschaft der Universit\u00e4t Z\u00fcrich stellt der SRG ebenfalls ein gutes Zeugnis aus. Ihre Radio- und Fernsehnachrichten f\u00fchren das Qualit\u00e4tsranking an, haben demnach eine h\u00f6here Relevanz, Vielfalt und Professionalit\u00e4t bei der Berichterstattung als andere Medien.",

Instead, the mantra of stores like Target is design appreciation for all, knowing [that] the design gene lives within all of us.\u201d The Pratt symposium focused on design as a state of mind that informs every discipline. \u201cHow people interact, select, and share design has become a norm. Design is experiential, aspirational, and essential in our daily lives,\u201d added Rosen.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Over an illustrious career trajectory, Millman has had the opportunity to investigate the relationship between design and branding. \u201cPutting this presentation together, a Winston Churchill quote came to mind: \u2018We shape our buildings; thereafter, they shape us.\u2019 I had the same question about branding and design. Is branding the birthplace of design or is design the birthplace of branding? I don\u2019t have an easy answer because, perhaps, it\u2019s a little of both. Branding is a very interesting profession. It\u2019s not actually a discipline; you don\u2019t do branding, you do a lot of other things that result in the development of a brand.\u201d</p> \n <p>Millman sees \u201cbranding as a process of manufacturing meaning. We create a construct around this thing, then people agree on those attributes, whether it\u2019s something that has to do with efficacy, pain relief, or athletic prowess. Design is the intentional communication of that meaning. Branding allows you to understand what something actually is and design gives you the sense of what it can do.\u201d</p> \n <p>Branding begins with the boldest gestures of a corporation in terms of ideas and works down to the tiniest iterations of every communication touchpoint. \u201cThe only way to build a great brand is from the inside, to understand the brand intention. Why do we need another brand of bottled water? Why do we need another running shoe? There must be a reason for that brand to exist.</p> \n <p>\u201cMy definition of branding is very simple,\u201d Millman continued. \u201cI wrote a book about the definition of branding from branding experts\u2019 opinions, interviewed 20 of the greatest minds in branding and got 20 definitions.

        "structuredText": "<div>  \n <p>True crime stories have a unique way of capturing the public\u2019s interest. Over the years, countless books, movies, television shows, documentaries, and media outlets have exposed the victims, murderers, and alleged murderers to the public through basic storytelling ingredients: orientation and context, crisis and conflict, and\u2014eventually\u2014resolution.</p> \n <p>It\u2019s no wonder that when the murder mystery of Hae Min Lee was brought to podcasting, it sparked interest in the medium overall. In 2014, the investigative podcast series <a href=\"https://serialpodcast.org/season-one\">Serial</a> launched its first season. Hosted by journalist Sarah Koenig, Serial was quickly ranked number one on iTunes and remained in the position for several weeks, later winning a <a href=\"http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/serial\">Peabody Award</a> in 2015.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p></p> \n <p>While Serial became many listeners\u2019 first introduction to podcasts, it certainly wasn\u2019t the only one with an audience. Since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/feb/12/broadcasting.digitalmedia\">its inception in 2004</a>, podcasting\u2019s popularity has steadily grown. But Serial did signal a trend. At the time of Serial\u2019s peak, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/18/serial-podcast-itunes-apple-downloads-streams\">Apple predicted</a> that users would listen to 7 billion podcasts in 2014 alone, compared with 1 billion subscribers in 2013. Indeed, there was a <a href=\"https://www.copyblogger.com/growth-of-podcasting/\">boost in the percentage</a> of Americans who listen to monthly podcasts, jumping to 17% by the end of 2015 from 12% mid-2013.</p> \n <p>As content marketers scramble to enhance their offering, many brands have also seen the branding potential of podcasting and some\u2014both business and consumer brands\u2014are already doing it successfully.</p> \n <p>But the challenge for many brands lies in defining and communicating their message, while avoiding the tendency to sell (or oversell) products or services. While there are various factors to consider for creating a sound strategy (no pun intended), these five lenses can help brands develop clear objectives for producing a podcast channel.</p> \n <p>Identifying which audience to engage and developing personas are great starting points for any type of content production from whitepaper to social media post. When podcasting, consider if the brand\u2019s target audience is niche or broad.</p> \n <p>eBay\u2019s <a href=\"http://creative.gimletmedia.com/shows/open-for-business/\">Open For Business</a>, for example, explores different aspects of building a business from the genetics behind entrepreneurship to tips for navigating failure. While sponsored by eBay, the podcast doesn\u2019t only share how a person can build their own storefront on eBay\u2019s marketplace, but also offers insight on building a business for self-starters who might want to start a side business or already have one up and running. It\u2019s relevant for eBay as a brand because they are demonstrating that they understand why sellers use their marketplace and what kind of core skills are necessary to become an entrepreneur.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p></p> \n <p>In contrast, General Electric\u2019s podcast <a href=\"http://themessagepodcast.com/\">The Message</a> holds the interest of a more general audience. The eight-episode series explores how a message from outer space, received 70 years ago, is deciphered and decoded. GE has since published a second series, a fictional thriller entitled Life After,that explores an afterlife where the deceased are digitally preserved. The podcasts use storytelling to engage a broader audience while sharing themes that reflect GE\u2019s work in science and technology.</p> \n <p>It\u2019s important to provide themes to help manage the expectations of the audience when they tune-in to the podcast; no one watches Game of Thrones and expects to see Carrie Bradshaw sporting a tutu. Similar to a television series, a newspaper column, or a blog, the podcast should have a cohesive theme\u2014a general concept or a distinct subject\u2014that speaks to your target audience.</p> \n <p>For brands, the theme should hold relevance for the target audience. Mattress startup Casper uses comedy to uncover what happens when your head hits the pillow during In Your Dreams. Virgin Atlantic\u2019s <a href=\"https://blog.virginatlantic.com/introducing-virgin-atlantics-first-podcast-venture/\">The Venture</a>, meanwhile, follows the journeys of entrepreneurs who have made waves in their industries, tapping into a traveler\u2019s sense of adventure.</p> \n <p>If defining a podcast\u2019s audience and theme are intrinsically linked and essential to a successful launch, providing value to the listener\u2014whether skewed towards entertaining, storytelling, or practical application\u2014is what keeps them coming back for future episodes. One listener might not glean the same value from one podcast as the next, so when it comes to brand building, ask how the value offered in the podcast reflects the value provided by the brand.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Take Tinder\u2019s podcast <a href=\"http://creative.gimletmedia.com/shows/dtr/\">DTR</a>, which is all about defining relationships and, more specifically dating, in the digital age. Although it offers an entertaining experience to just about anyone who tunes in, the value for the listener likely depends on one\u2019s relationship status. Single? There could be some nuggets of helpful information that can help navigate conversations with matched users. Already hitched? Listen and live vicariously through others\u2019 stories.</p> \n <p>Style can make or break a podcast. This includes everything from the host, participants, and discussion format to the language and tone, show length, and even the timbre of the host. These decisions impact the experience for the user and, like any branded experience, connects directly back to the brand. For branded podcasts, consider how outside voices can help build the brand\u2019s authenticity\u2014allowing others to speak on your behalf brings a humanizing element to the experience.</p> \n <p><a href=\"http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/podcasts/\">Exchanges by Goldman Sachs</a> features a dedicated host, a Goldman Sachs employee, and the occasional outside guest discussing a specific trend that might be influencing markets. The discussion brings various perspectives to light, creating an industry exposition that helps the listener understand that specific sector. The polished presentation and insightful information reflect Goldman\u2019s determination to make \u201c<a href=\"http://www.goldmansachs.com/who-we-are/progress/\">Progress Everyone\u2019s Business</a>.\u201d</p> \n <p>Another example is McAfee\u2019s podcast <a href=\"https://hackablepodcast.com/#/\">Hackable</a>, which shares information on information technology (IT), the Internet of Things, and hacking. Throughout the panel\u2019s discussion-style episodes, conversational snippets from guests help tell stories about cybercrime. For many listeners, the simplified language helps illustrate complex IT scenarios and leaves an impression that the brand is approachable, supporting their brand message that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/us/microsites/mcafee-brand/index.html\">Together is Power</a>.\u201d</p> \n <p>Since users can only subscribe at the main channel or feed level of the podcast, the architecture becomes especially relevant if there are several topics or themes to explore. Podcasts typically fall into one of three architecture models:</p> \n <p>One way to determine channel architecture is to revisit the audience and thematic needs. Is the audience for the themes the same or different? Is there specific information that is relevant for one group, but not another? If the brand typically appeals to one target audience, then Model 1 or 2 might make the most sense. But what if you have audiences of multiple demographics and interests? Would Model 3 be most logical? This is when having a deep understanding of the brand\u2019s personas is important.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Even if the right format seems elusive at first, remember that there\u2019s also room for growth and evolution within these structures. GE followed a single-channel model when it first published The Message, but once its second podcast Life After was introduced, that channel developed into one subscription base for two different series. NPR\u2019s top-ranked podcast This American Life started with its own channel and subsequently created a second channel with Serial. After two seasons of Serial, S-Town debuted as a co-production by Serial and This American Life, which transformed the architecture into Model 3.</p> \n <p>Whichever model works best, when it comes to producing a branded podcast, true crime, slice of life, business-oriented, or otherwise, there are many ways to approach a strategy that successfully reflects the voice of the brand while meeting business objectives.

Over the years, countless books, movies, television shows, documentaries, and media outlets have exposed the victims, murderers, and alleged murderers to the public through basic storytelling ingredients: orientation and context, crisis and conflict, and\u2014eventually\u2014resolution. It\u2019s no wonder that when the murder mystery of Hae Min Lee was brought to podcasting, it sparked interest in the medium overall. In 2014, the investigative podcast series Serial launched its first season. Hosted by journalist Sarah Koenig, Serial was quickly ranked number one on iTunes and remained in the position for several weeks, later winning a Peabody Award in 2015. While Serial became many listeners\u2019 first introduction to podcasts, it certainly wasn\u2019t the only one with an audience. Since its inception in 2004, podcasting\u2019s popularity has steadily grown. But Serial did signal a trend. At the time of Serial\u2019s peak, Apple predicted that users would listen to 7 billion podcasts in 2014 alone, compared with 1 billion subscribers in 2013. Indeed, there was a boost in the percentage of Americans who listen to monthly podcasts, jumping to 17% by the end of 2015 from 12% mid-2013. As content marketers scramble to enhance their offering, many brands have also seen the branding potential of podcasting and some\u2014both business and consumer brands\u2014are already doing it successfully. But the challenge for many brands lies in defining and communicating their message, while avoiding the tendency to sell (or oversell) products or services. While there are various factors to consider for creating a sound strategy (no pun intended), these five lenses can help brands develop clear objectives for producing a podcast channel. Identifying which audience to engage and developing personas are great starting points for any type of content production from whitepaper to social media post. When podcasting, consider if the brand\u2019s target audience is niche or broad. eBay\u2019s Open For Business, for example, explores different aspects of building a business from the genetics behind entrepreneurship to tips for navigating failure. While sponsored by eBay, the podcast doesn\u2019t only share how a person can build their own storefront on eBay\u2019s marketplace, but also offers insight on building a business for self-starters who might want to start a side business or already have one up and running. It\u2019s relevant for eBay as a brand because they are demonstrating that they understand why sellers use their marketplace and what kind of core skills are necessary to become an entrepreneur. In contrast, General Electric\u2019s podcast The Message holds the interest of a more general audience. The eight-episode series explores how a message from outer space, received 70 years ago, is deciphered and decoded. GE has since published a second series, a fictional thriller entitled Life After,that explores an afterlife where the deceased are digitally preserved. The podcasts use storytelling to engage a broader audience while sharing themes that reflect GE\u2019s work in science and technology. It\u2019s important to provide themes to help manage the expectations of the audience when they tune-in to the podcast; no one watches Game of Thrones and expects to see Carrie Bradshaw sporting a tutu. Similar to a television series, a newspaper column, or a blog, the podcast should have a cohesive theme\u2014a general concept or a distinct subject\u2014that speaks to your target audience. For brands, the theme should hold relevance for the target audience. Mattress startup Casper uses comedy to uncover what happens when your head hits the pillow during In Your Dreams. Virgin Atlantic\u2019s The Venture, meanwhile, follows the journeys of entrepreneurs who have made waves in their industries, tapping into a traveler\u2019s sense of adventure. If defining a podcast\u2019s audience and theme are intrinsically linked and essential to a successful launch, providing value to the listener\u2014whether skewed towards entertaining, storytelling, or practical application\u2014is what keeps them coming back for future episodes. One listener might not glean the same value from one podcast as the next, so when it comes to brand building, ask how the value offered in the podcast reflects the value provided by the brand. Take Tinder\u2019s podcast DTR, which is all about defining relationships and, more specifically dating, in the digital age. Although it offers an entertaining experience to just about anyone who tunes in, the value for the listener likely depends on one\u2019s relationship status. Single? There could be some nuggets of helpful information that can help navigate conversations with matched users. Already hitched? Listen and live vicariously through others\u2019 stories. Style can make or break a podcast. This includes everything from the host, participants, and discussion format to the language and tone, show length, and even the timbre of the host. These decisions impact the experience for the user and, like any branded experience, connects directly back to the brand. For branded podcasts, consider how outside voices can help build the brand\u2019s authenticity\u2014allowing others to speak on your behalf brings a humanizing element to the experience. Exchanges by Goldman Sachs features a dedicated host, a Goldman Sachs employee, and the occasional outside guest discussing a specific trend that might be influencing markets. The discussion brings various perspectives to light, creating an industry exposition that helps the listener understand that specific sector. The polished presentation and insightful information reflect Goldman\u2019s determination to make \u201cProgress Everyone\u2019s Business.\u201d Another example is McAfee\u2019s podcast Hackable, which shares information on information technology (IT), the Internet of Things, and hacking. Throughout the panel\u2019s discussion-style episodes, conversational snippets from guests help tell stories about cybercrime. For many listeners, the simplified language helps illustrate complex IT scenarios and leaves an impression that the brand is approachable, supporting their brand message that \u201cTogether is Power.\u201d Since users can only subscribe at the main channel or feed level of the podcast, the architecture becomes especially relevant if there are several topics or themes to explore. Podcasts typically fall into one of three architecture models: One way to determine channel architecture is to revisit the audience and thematic needs. Is the audience for the themes the same or different? Is there specific information that is relevant for one group, but not another? If the brand typically appeals to one target audience, then Model 1 or 2 might make the most sense. But what if you have audiences of multiple demographics and interests? Would Model 3 be most logical? This is when having a deep understanding of the brand\u2019s personas is important. Even if the right format seems elusive at first, remember that there\u2019s also room for growth and evolution within these structures. GE followed a single-channel model when it first published The Message, but once its second podcast Life After was introduced, that channel developed into one subscription base for two different series. NPR\u2019s top-ranked podcast This American Life started with its own channel and subsequently created a second channel with Serial. After two seasons of Serial, S-Town debuted as a co-production by Serial and This American Life, which transformed the architecture into Model 3. Whichever model works best, when it comes to producing a branded podcast, true crime, slice of life, business-oriented, or otherwise, there are many ways to approach a strategy that successfully reflects the voice of the brand while meeting business objectives. With careful consideration for the fundamental elements of target audience, theme, value, style, and architecture can help launch a brand into the world of podcasting. Cover image source: NeONBRAND",

I'm a huge advocate when it comes to personal branding -- it's how I built my first <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/marketing\">marketing</a> agency. I leveraged my personal <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/branding\">brand</a> and <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/245720\">bootstrapped its growth</a>, allowing me to avoid taking out a business loan or giving up equity to an investor. To this day, I retain 100 percent ownership of every business I operate.</p> \n<p>When done right, you are able to establish yourself as an authority, create an authentic voice and attract business through transparency and expertise. I've discussed ways to <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/287399\">build your personal brand</a> in the past and mentioned some <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/304811\">online personal branding tools</a> that you can use -- and now I want to talk about effective strategies. I spoke with several <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/entrepreneurs\">entrepreneurs</a> to come up with a list of a dozen ways you can elevate your personal brand in the upcoming year.</p> \n<p>I have been sending out a weekly newsletter for several years, but through my company, so it's geared toward online marketing.

Google s'engage donc dans la lutte contre les \u00abmauvaises publicit\u00e9s\u00bb qui font tant de tort aux acteurs du Web, qui pour la plupart vivent de la r\u00e9clame. C'est le cas \u00e9videmment de Google, dont les revenus sont quasi exclusivement publicitaires. Pour l'achat de mots-cl\u00e9s, l'activit\u00e9 principale du moteur de recherche Google, la question de la mauvaise pub ne se pose pas. Elle est n\u00e9anmoins le probl\u00e8me majeur de nombreux sites qui abusent de formats de plus en plus spectaculaires pour \u00e9merger. En promettant une navigation plus saine, Google cherche \u00e0 prendre le probl\u00e8me en amont, pour dissuader in fine les internautes d'avoir recours \u00e0 des bloqueurs de publicit\u00e9 type Adblock, une extension de navigateur qui filtre le contenu des pages Web pour bloquer notamment les banni\u00e8res, format le plus r\u00e9pandu sur Internet. Avec son nouveau Chrome, Google veut aussi inciter les sites les moins \u00abvertueux\u00bb en mati\u00e8re de pub \u00e0 faire \u00e9voluer leurs pratiques, dans le souci de l'internaute mais aussi des sites \u00e9ditoriaux qui d\u00e9pendent pour la grande majorit\u00e9 de la publicit\u00e9. Si un site \u00abpousse\u00bb des pubs intrusives, il sera mis en garde une premi\u00e8re fois par Google. Si les \u00e9carts se reproduisent, Chrome pourra bloquer toutes ses publicit\u00e9s. La m\u00e9thode peut potentiellement \u00abnettoyer\u00bb une partie du Web. L'implication de Google marque en tout cas un tournant dans la prise en compte de la probl\u00e9matique publicitaire par les grands acteurs du Web. Apple s'est lui aussi lanc\u00e9 dans une d\u00e9marche qui vise \u00e0 limiter la publicit\u00e9 jug\u00e9e trop intrusive. La derni\u00e8re version de son navigateur Safari (pour ordinateur et mobile) int\u00e8gre une fonctionnalit\u00e9, l'\u00abIntelligent Tracking Prevention\u00bb, qui traque encore plus s\u00e9v\u00e8rement qu'avant les cookies, petits fichiers qui suivent le surf des internautes pour les cibler publicitairement. Apple l'a mis en place en septembre dernier au nom de la protection des donn\u00e9es personnelles. Au grand dam des professionnels de la publicit\u00e9, mais aussi de nombreux \u00e9diteurs.",

I believe that process problems are the big barrier to mass use.</p> \n<p>We all know how to turn on a radio. Even my kids, digital natives though they are, could figure that out pretty easily. But \u201cturning on\u201d a podcast is more complicated. Assuming you know what podcasts are (and many still don\u2019t), it is not obvious where you find them.

The way to figure out how your processes can be improved is to start with mapping, from the customer\u2019s point of view.

In the early days of podcasting you had to be (or be friends with) a geek to figure out how to find and listen to podcasts. Then Apple started listing podcasts in iTunes, which made it easier for podcasts to be discovered.

This is called ethnographic research. It can be expensive, since it usually involves a lot of time for both the observations and the analysis. But even just sending your own staff out to observe, or, at a minimum, conducting in-depth interviews with users or prospects, will at least get you heading down the right path.

With Apple and Google both debuting augmented reality platforms (ARKit and ARCore, respectively), Facebook heavily invested in its Oculus headset and Amazon unveiling augmented shopping features, AR and VR is primed to change many parts of our everyday lives.</p> \n <p>Within the food industry, AR and VR have also begun to make headway. Although development costs are still high, more and more F&amp;B businesses are beginning to realize the potential of AR/VR and see it as a worthwhile investment. Three main areas \u2013 human resources, customer experiences, food products \u2013 have seen the most concentration of AR/VR development so far and will likely continue to push the envelope on what use cases AR &amp; VR have within the industry.</p> \n <p>Streamlining Employee Training</p> \n <p>One of the most tangible payoffs of AR/VR technology is using it for consistent and thorough employee training. The current process of developing training materials can not only be costly, but also vary in quality by team, store, or region. Many times, human resources face the conundrum of choosing between low-touch, high-efficiency (i.e. mass group workshops with the potential downside of low retention and lackluster individualized learning) or high-touch, high-cost (i.e. small group sessions with in-store, real-time training).</p> \n <p>Enter virtual reality. Virtual reality can create a detailed visual world for employees to safely interact with their to-be everyday job surroundings and mentally and physically learn the tasks required. These VR lessons range from managing Walmart\u2019s holiday rush to cooking noodles at Honeygrow to perfecting the espresso pull.</p> \n <p>On the flip side, augmented reality allows for side-by-side training and execution by layering additional information on top of an employee\u2019s direct view. For instance, a research study found AR to be effective in helping subjects visually estimate serving sizes. Maintenance and repair, a necessary evil of the food world, has benefited from equipping technicians with AR headsets to disassemble and reassemble products without being on-site.</p> \n <p>These new possibilities for learning and development for businesses small and large not only increase the effectiveness of training material, but also allow companies to employ a wider breadth of workers with different needs and learning styles. As headsets begin to decrease in price and more developers pour into AR/VR, it\u2019s likely more and more companies will begin to trial and A/B test these new learning platforms. Perhaps one day, we\u2019ll even view former mass conference workshops with the same nostalgia as the milk delivery man.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Creating Wonder in the Customer Experience</p> \n <p>\u201cExperiential marketing\u201d has fundamentally changed the purpose and construction of food and hospitality driven events. Millennials especially view experiences as a means of social capital, and sharing their attendance and participation at an en vogue experience is an important piece of their curated social identities. The success of events such as the Museum of Ice Cream and 29 Rooms have convinced many brands \u2013 Grey Goose, Red Bull, Zappos, to name a few \u2013 to begin reallocating advertising dollars to experiences and sponsorships.</p> \n <p>Augmented and virtual reality play naturally into this shift. Both are vehicles to activate all senses and immerse the consumer within a specific branded experience. VR experiences in particular have seen growing traction for use during food &amp; beverage events. A great example is the \u201cBoursin Sensorium\u201d, a CGI-based VR experience that paired motion (through moving chairs), scents and tasting samples of Boursin cheese. Patron tequila used 360 video to showcase the behind-the-scenes making process at its event booths and Innis &amp; Gunn beer used coordinated VR footage to complement the taste of its beer. Restaurants and bars are also taking notice: Baptise &amp; Bottle in Chicago unveiled a VR tour to pair with physical scotch; SubliMotion in Ibiza lets diners go skydiving in Samsung Gear VR; Space Needle has launched a sky-high VR bar.</p> \n <p>Augmenting the physical world with interesting and shareable content has been the focus of AR in experiential marketing. Remy Martin and Macallan both used holographic visuals for their Microsoft Hololens-specific \u201cRooted in Excellence\u201d experience and The Macallan gallery experience, respectively. Given Hololens\u2019 hefty price tag ($3,000 for the base Development Edition), most other brands have stuck with mobile AR \u2013 such as Coca Cola\u2019s Christmas magic campaign that gave users the ability to see virtual Santa and hidden scenes across branded bus stops in NYC or Patron\u2019s AR-enabled tasting experience with a mini bartender. Brick-and-mortar locations are also toying with fun AR elements, with London\u2019s City Social debuting cocktail coasters outfitted with augmented visuals and India-based chain Beer Caf\u00e9 using AR to educate drinkers on the origins, ABV, category and taste of each beer available.</p> \n <p>If the last few years are any indication, even more futuristic applications of AR/VR are soon to come. Visual enjoyment is a major part of any eating and drinking experience and brands have come to embrace virtual overlays \u2013 whether immersed in VR or augmented in AR \u2013 as a way to educate, inspire, and prompt consumers to action. In one extreme scenario, like the world Project Nourish paints, we could all be eating and sensing two entirely different things!</p> \n <p> </p> \n <p>Adding Interactivity to Products</p> \n <p>Since Bill Gates\u2019 famous 1996 essay, the adage \u201ccontent is king\u201d has been echoed and taken to heart by companies large and small. In recent years, the rise of platforms such and Instagram and Pinterest \u2013 and the social influencers and blogger celebrities it has created \u2013 have shown even more clearly that engaging with consumers digitally result in real action. Products and retail locations may still be static, but its content must extend beyond physical space to attract the attention of potential and returning buyers.</p> \n <p>Augmented reality can bridge this gap between consumer, product and product content. The ability to overlay additional information, visual stimulus and interaction on top of specific items give product companies the chance to combine the digital world with the physical one in a targeted and seamless way. Food and beverage companies have begun to utilize AR in innovative new ways: Treasury Wine Estates\u2019 line 19 Crimes brings each label\u2019s pictured convict to life in AR; Nestle used a character from the movie \u201cRio\u201d for an AR game available on 26 million boxes; Walmart and Kraft teamed up for an AR-backed summer sweepstakes to sell more Kraft products. One recent, poignant example was when chef &amp; restauranteur David Chang released his limited-edition Momofuku x Nike sneaker via Nike\u2019s AR app SNKRS, which would only allow fans buying access to the shoe when physically located at Fuku\u2019s East Village location.</p> \n <p>The potent ability of AR to enrich the knowledge and visuals of physical content goes beyond marketing purposes. Companies can use the technology to educate consumers on nutritional information and product composition or even make healthy but bland-looking foods appear more appealing. AR also allows physical content, like cookbooks, to merge with digital content for a simultaneous cross-medium experience as HoloYummy showcased with 3D dish renderings of Chef Dominique Crenn\u2019s book Metamorphosis of Taste.</p> \n <p>As consumers become more comfortable with AR, its presence will become a more continuous expectation. Instagram\u2019s rise to prominence resulted in an entire industry of specialists across the world, allowing for mass adoption for even small businesses. AR is at the base of the same mountain; big brands are already repeatedly using AR outreach, but it still needs momentum from creators, developers and marketers to make it accessible for anyone and everyone.</p>  \n</div>",

Many times, human resources face the conundrum of choosing between low-touch, high-efficiency (i.e. mass group workshops with the potential downside of low retention and lackluster individualized learning) or high-touch, high-cost (i.e. small group sessions with in-store, real-time training). Enter virtual reality. Virtual reality can create a detailed visual world for employees to safely interact with their to-be everyday job surroundings and mentally and physically learn the tasks required. These VR lessons range from managing Walmart\u2019s holiday rush to cooking noodles at Honeygrow to perfecting the espresso pull. On the flip side, augmented reality allows for side-by-side training and execution by layering additional information on top of an employee\u2019s direct view. For instance, a research study found AR to be effective in helping subjects visually estimate serving sizes. Maintenance and repair, a necessary evil of the food world, has benefited from equipping technicians with AR headsets to disassemble and reassemble products without being on-site. These new possibilities for learning and development for businesses small and large not only increase the effectiveness of training material, but also allow companies to employ a wider breadth of workers with different needs and learning styles. As headsets begin to decrease in price and more developers pour into AR/VR, it\u2019s likely more and more companies will begin to trial and A/B test these new learning platforms. Perhaps one day, we\u2019ll even view former mass conference workshops with the same nostalgia as the milk delivery man. Creating Wonder in the Customer Experience \u201cExperiential marketing\u201d has fundamentally changed the purpose and construction of food and hospitality driven events. Millennials especially view experiences as a means of social capital, and sharing their attendance and participation at an en vogue experience is an important piece of their curated social identities. The success of events such as the Museum of Ice Cream and 29 Rooms have convinced many brands \u2013 Grey Goose, Red Bull, Zappos, to name a few \u2013 to begin reallocating advertising dollars to experiences and sponsorships. Augmented and virtual reality play naturally into this shift. Both are vehicles to activate all senses and immerse the consumer within a specific branded experience. VR experiences in particular have seen growing traction for use during food & beverage events. A great example is the \u201cBoursin Sensorium\u201d, a CGI-based VR experience that paired motion (through moving chairs), scents and tasting samples of Boursin cheese. Patron tequila used 360 video to showcase the behind-the-scenes making process at its event booths and Innis & Gunn beer used coordinated VR footage to complement the taste of its beer. Restaurants and bars are also taking notice: Baptise & Bottle in Chicago unveiled a VR tour to pair with physical scotch; SubliMotion in Ibiza lets diners go skydiving in Samsung Gear VR; Space Needle has launched a sky-high VR bar. Augmenting the physical world with interesting and shareable content has been the focus of AR in experiential marketing. Remy Martin and Macallan both used holographic visuals for their Microsoft Hololens-specific \u201cRooted in Excellence\u201d experience and The Macallan gallery experience, respectively. Given Hololens\u2019 hefty price tag ($3,000 for the base Development Edition), most other brands have stuck with mobile AR \u2013 such as Coca Cola\u2019s Christmas magic campaign that gave users the ability to see virtual Santa and hidden scenes across branded bus stops in NYC or Patron\u2019s AR-enabled tasting experience with a mini bartender. Brick-and-mortar locations are also toying with fun AR elements, with London\u2019s City Social debuting cocktail coasters outfitted with augmented visuals and India-based chain Beer Caf\u00e9 using AR to educate drinkers on the origins, ABV, category and taste of each beer available. If the last few years are any indication, even more futuristic applications of AR/VR are soon to come. Visual enjoyment is a major part of any eating and drinking experience and brands have come to embrace virtual overlays \u2013 whether immersed in VR or augmented in AR \u2013 as a way to educate, inspire, and prompt consumers to action. In one extreme scenario, like the world Project Nourish paints, we could all be eating and sensing two entirely different things! Adding Interactivity to Products Since Bill Gates\u2019 famous 1996 essay, the adage \u201ccontent is king\u201d has been echoed and taken to heart by companies large and small. In recent years, the rise of platforms such and Instagram and Pinterest \u2013 and the social influencers and blogger celebrities it has created \u2013 have shown even more clearly that engaging with consumers digitally result in real action. Products and retail locations may still be static, but its content must extend beyond physical space to attract the attention of potential and returning buyers. Augmented reality can bridge this gap between consumer, product and product content. The ability to overlay additional information, visual stimulus and interaction on top of specific items give product companies the chance to combine the digital world with the physical one in a targeted and seamless way. Food and beverage companies have begun to utilize AR in innovative new ways: Treasury Wine Estates\u2019 line 19 Crimes brings each label\u2019s pictured convict to life in AR; Nestle used a character from the movie \u201cRio\u201d for an AR game available on 26 million boxes; Walmart and Kraft teamed up for an AR-backed summer sweepstakes to sell more Kraft products. One recent, poignant example was when chef & restauranteur David Chang released his limited-edition Momofuku x Nike sneaker via Nike\u2019s AR app SNKRS, which would only allow fans buying access to the shoe when physically located at Fuku\u2019s East Village location. The potent ability of AR to enrich the knowledge and visuals of physical content goes beyond marketing purposes. Companies can use the technology to educate consumers on nutritional information and product composition or even make healthy but bland-looking foods appear more appealing. AR also allows physical content, like cookbooks, to merge with digital content for a simultaneous cross-medium experience as HoloYummy showcased with 3D dish renderings of Chef Dominique Crenn\u2019s book Metamorphosis of Taste. As consumers become more comfortable with AR, its presence will become a more continuous expectation. Instagram\u2019s rise to prominence resulted in an entire industry of specialists across the world, allowing for mass adoption for even small businesses. AR is at the base of the same mountain; big brands are already repeatedly using AR outreach, but it still needs momentum from creators, developers and marketers to make it accessible for anyone and everyone.",

Le mie prime pubblicazioni in questo ambito risalgono agli anni '90. Ma solo ora abbiamo abbastanza potenza di calcolo per affrontare tali sistemi.

L\u00e0 fuori, ad esempio, ci sono miliardi di volte pi\u00f9 luce solare che sulla nostra terra. L'IA colonizzer\u00e0 prima il sistema solare poi, nel giro di pochi milioni di anni, l'intera Via Lattea. Lo spazio \u00e8 fatto per le IA progettate in modo adeguato, non per noi. Visto che l'universo visibile \u00e8 ancora molto giovane, e probabilmente invecchier\u00e0 ancora per milioni di anni, c\u2019\u00e8 tempo pi\u00f9 che sufficiente per le IA per colonizzare l\u2019universo e trasformarlo completamente.</p> \n <p>La fantascienza tradizionale non ha capito o non ha voluto capire come l'IA si svilupper\u00e0 concretamente. La fantascienza del secolo scorso era per lo pi\u00f9 antropocentrica. Autori come Isaac Asimov progettarono imperi galattici, ma dovettero inventare delle castronerie fisiche, come gli ipersalti e sistemi super-leggeri di velocit\u00e0, per rendere la breve durata di vita dell'uomo compatibile con le grandi distanze della Via Lattea. Per contro, le IA progettate adeguatamente non avranno problemi con la limitazione naturale della velocit\u00e0 della fisica.

Elon Musk tempo fa mi ha invitato a una festa famigliare, e abbiamo parlato del tema per ore. Ogni volta che incontro persone cos\u00ec influenti, cerco di placare le loro paure. In realt\u00e0 \u00e8 chiaro che l'IA non aumenta il potenziale di autodistruzione sulla terra. La massima capacit\u00e0 di autodistruzione \u00e8 gi\u00e0 stata raggiunta negli anni \u201860 con la bomba a idrogeno.

Allora avrei scritto: il fuoco ha grandi vantaggi, possiamo cucinare e tenerci al caldo di notte. Ma il fuoco pu\u00f2 anche causare incendi e bruciare altre persone.

Non esiste una ragione fisica oggi nota per cui ci\u00f2 sia in linea di principio impossibile. Supponiamo, quindi, che questa sia la verit\u00e0: cos\u00ec una mente tanto \u201ccaricata\u201d, in un primo momento ancora molto umana, si trover\u00e0 subito confrontata con grandi tentazioni. </p> \n <p>Ad esempio, non avere solo due occhi, ma averne un milione, inclusa una capacit\u00e0 visiva simile ai radar o una vista radiografica. Oppure ancora avere un udito per tutti i tipi di suoni che oggi non possiamo cogliere. Oppure aumentare di un milione di volte le capacit\u00e0 di calcolo del nostro cervello. Coloro che cedono a queste tentazioni diventano presto sovrumani e disumani, avvicinandosi all\u2019intelligenza artificiale pura che non porta appresso alcuna zavorra biologico evolutiva.</p> \n <p>Nell\u2019ambito dell\u2019espansione della sfera dell\u2019Intelligenza artificiale, che presto si diffonder\u00e0 a grande velocit\u00e0 dal sistema solare, lui o lei non sar\u00e0 pi\u00f9 in grado di competere con la vera IA, e l\u2019umanit\u00e0 non potr\u00e0 pi\u00f9 giocare un ruolo significativo. In futuro, le decisioni saranno probabilmente prese da coloro che sapranno sfruttare tutte queste potenzialit\u00e0 e le nuove capacit\u00e0 di calcolo. In entrambi i casi, la persona convenzionale come noi oggi la conosciamo non giocher\u00e0 pi\u00f9 un ruolo importante.

L'IA colonizzer\u00e0 prima il sistema solare poi, nel giro di pochi milioni di anni, l'intera Via Lattea. Lo spazio \u00e8 fatto per le IA progettate in modo adeguato, non per noi. Visto che l'universo visibile \u00e8 ancora molto giovane, e probabilmente invecchier\u00e0 ancora per milioni di anni, c\u2019\u00e8 tempo pi\u00f9 che sufficiente per le IA per colonizzare l\u2019universo e trasformarlo completamente. La fantascienza tradizionale non ha capito o non ha voluto capire come l'IA si svilupper\u00e0 concretamente. La fantascienza del secolo scorso era per lo pi\u00f9 antropocentrica. Autori come Isaac Asimov progettarono imperi galattici, ma dovettero inventare delle castronerie fisiche, come gli ipersalti e sistemi super-leggeri di velocit\u00e0, per rendere la breve durata di vita dell'uomo compatibile con le grandi distanze della Via Lattea. Per contro, le IA progettate adeguatamente non avranno problemi con la limitazione naturale della velocit\u00e0 della fisica. E anche il \"Beamen\" \u00e8 triviale per le IA - possono muoversi alla velocit\u00e0 della luce tra trasmettitore e ricevitore, proprio come facciamo da tempo nei nostri laboratori. \u00c8 interessante vedere come spesso le persone che non sono esperti di IA \u2013 tra cui molti filosofi, fisici e imprenditori \u2013 prendano la parola. Elon Musk tempo fa mi ha invitato a una festa famigliare, e abbiamo parlato del tema per ore. Ogni volta che incontro persone cos\u00ec influenti, cerco di placare le loro paure. In realt\u00e0 \u00e8 chiaro che l'IA non aumenta il potenziale di autodistruzione sulla terra. La massima capacit\u00e0 di autodistruzione \u00e8 gi\u00e0 stata raggiunta negli anni \u201860 con la bomba a idrogeno. Ci sono diverse potenze nel mondo che hanno a disposizione questa tecnologia e possono annientare la civilt\u00e0 come la conosciamo oggi entro due ore. Al momento il 95% della ricerca sull\u2019IA \u00e8 molto concentrata sui bisogni dell\u2019uomo, per rendere le persone pi\u00f9 longeve e pi\u00f9 sane, cos\u00ec come renderle pi\u00f9 dipendenti dal loro smartphone. C'\u00e8 quindi una grande necessit\u00e0 commerciale di costruire intelligenze artificiali in modo tale che siano vicine all\u2019uomo e rendano la loro vita pi\u00f9 semplice, altrimenti non verrebbero acquistate. Anche se le reti LSTM sono utilizzate per controllare tra l\u2019altro i droni, gli usi militari per\u00f2 rappresentano solo una frazione della ricerca attuale. Proprio come avrei firmato una lettera di questo tipo 750.000 anni fa quando l\u2019uomo riusc\u00ec a controllare il fuoco. Allora avrei scritto: il fuoco ha grandi vantaggi, possiamo cucinare e tenerci al caldo di notte. Ma il fuoco pu\u00f2 anche causare incendi e bruciare altre persone. Dobbiamo essere consapevoli dei pericoli e concentrarci sulla promozione degli aspetti positivi della nuova tecnologia. Gi\u00e0 da tempo siamo dei cyborg: indossiamo occhiali e orologi, recentemente abbiamo persino costruito impianti e protesi che reagiscono ai nostri segnali nervosi. Siamo in costante miglioramento grazie alla fusione con la tecnologia. Da decenni speculiamo che prima o poi si possa carpire la nostra mente dalle sinapsi del cervello e trapiantarla in un computer, per poter continuare a vivere in una simulazione, ad esempio in un paradiso virtuale, e mantenere comunque l'accesso alla realt\u00e0 attraverso sensori e attuatori. Non esiste una ragione fisica oggi nota per cui ci\u00f2 sia in linea di principio impossibile. Supponiamo, quindi, che questa sia la verit\u00e0: cos\u00ec una mente tanto \u201ccaricata\u201d, in un primo momento ancora molto umana, si trover\u00e0 subito confrontata con grandi tentazioni. Ad esempio, non avere solo due occhi, ma averne un milione, inclusa una capacit\u00e0 visiva simile ai radar o una vista radiografica. Oppure ancora avere un udito per tutti i tipi di suoni che oggi non possiamo cogliere. Oppure aumentare di un milione di volte le capacit\u00e0 di calcolo del nostro cervello. Coloro che cedono a queste tentazioni diventano presto sovrumani e disumani, avvicinandosi all\u2019intelligenza artificiale pura che non porta appresso alcuna zavorra biologico evolutiva. Nell\u2019ambito dell\u2019espansione della sfera dell\u2019Intelligenza artificiale, che presto si diffonder\u00e0 a grande velocit\u00e0 dal sistema solare, lui o lei non sar\u00e0 pi\u00f9 in grado di competere con la vera IA, e l\u2019umanit\u00e0 non potr\u00e0 pi\u00f9 giocare un ruolo significativo. In futuro, le decisioni saranno probabilmente prese da coloro che sapranno sfruttare tutte queste potenzialit\u00e0 e le nuove capacit\u00e0 di calcolo. In entrambi i casi, la persona convenzionale come noi oggi la conosciamo non giocher\u00e0 pi\u00f9 un ruolo importante. Tutto cambier\u00e0 e la storia della civilt\u00e0 dominata dall'uomo classico finir\u00e0 nei prossimi decenni.",

No security without total privacy surrender, eh?

Will they also have to strip naked in front of its all-seeing digital eye just to be granted access? Or will this AI-enhanced multi-layered biometric system end up making it harder to share devices between loved ones?

So while sensing emotional context might suggest some practical utility that smartphone users may welcome and enjoy, it\u2019s also potentially highly exploitable and could easily feel horribly invasive \u2014 opening the door to, say, a teenager\u2019s smartphone knowing exactly when to hit them with an ad because they\u2019re feeling low.</p> \n <p>If indeed on-device AI means locally processed emotion sensing systems could offer guarantees they would never leak mood data there may be less cause for concern.

And again, isn\u2019t AI supposed to be replacing drivers behind the wheel? Will a self-driving car require its rider to have driving insurance?

This discrepancy does not trouble the big data-mining businesses that have made it their mission to amass massive data-sets so they can fuel business-critical AI efforts behind the scenes. But for smartphone users asked to sleep beside a personal device that\u2019s actively eavesdropping on bedroom activity, for e.g., the equation starts to look rather more unbalanced. And even if YOU personally don\u2019t mind, what about everyone else around you whose \u201creal-world sounds\u201d will also be being snooped on by your phone, regardless of whether they like it or not. Have you asked them if they want an AI quantifying the noises they make? Are you going to inform everyone you meet that you\u2019re packing a wiretap?",

Adem\u00e1s se ha convertido\u00a0adem\u00e1s en arte y en una herramienta para la protesta en el activismo online. \u00a0Internet est\u00e1 lleno de p\u00e1ginas que explican c\u00f3mo utilizarlos adecuadamente para impulsar cambios sociales con mensajes sencillos, con datos y claro componente audiovisual. As\u00ed se han usado en campa\u00f1as recientes como la del #BlackLivesMatters, #MeToo o a favor y en contra de la independencia catalana. Pero ni las piezas de autor ni las activistas son las m\u00e1s compartidas en los m\u00f3viles y en internet, donde se prefiere recurrir a personajes de la cultura popular para lanzar mensajes llenos de humor en los que acaban participando figuras como Rajoy, Obama o los Minions. Las productoras han entrado en el juego y han convertido sus contenidos en peque\u00f1os anuncios que la gente comparte. Solo HBO, la productora de 'Juego de Tronos', tiene m\u00e1s de 7.000 gifs en Giphy, uno de los principales repositorios. Arte con el GIF Adem\u00e1s de llenar las webs de gatitos y actitudes compulsivas, con el formato GIF\u00a0tambi\u00e9n se ha hecho arte. Es el GIF Art, que tiene a artistas tan ilustres como\u00a0Bill Domonkos,\u00a0conocido porque ha animado obras cl\u00e1sicas como \u2018La muerte de Ofelia\u2019, del prerrafaelita John Everett, o Raphaelle Martin, que ha dado\u00a0movimiento a cuadros de Magritte,\u00a0o tambi\u00e9n Joe Maccarone, Carl Burton y Rebecca Mock.\u00a0 Tambi\u00e9n se organizan festivales y proyectos culturales como el\u00a0Gift it Up, un festival online organizado por Europeana y la Digital Public Library of America para popularizar el patrimonio de im\u00e1genes de Europa y EEUU m\u00e1s desconocido (manuscritos, fotos antiguas...) y\u00a0que lleva ya cuatro ediciones.

        "text": "Cold winter nights have me craving warm and filling meals and nothing pairs with a slice of my husband\u2019s homemade bread like a bowl (or two!) of tomato soup. Used in dishes, sauces, salads, drinks, and eaten raw, thousands of cultivars of the tomato are grown worldwide to meet modern consumption demands. However, this culinary vegetable was not originally warmly received by Anglo-Americans, who didn\u2019t think it was easily adapted to their palates.[i] Though a \u201cNew World\u201d cultivar, the tomato had quite a journey over time and space before becoming a consistent cultivar of antebellum American Southern cuisine. The cultivated tomato originated in Central America and was a late addition to the food supply of Mesoamericans, for no pre-Columbian archeological evidence of its cultivation has been uncovered. It first appears in written record in 1519, mentioned in Spanish explorer Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s\u2019s diary of his infamous conquest of Mexico. Although cultivated in Continental Europe since the 1540s, fundamentally altering foodways of the Spanish and Italians, Englishmen remained wary of the tomato for over two hundred years, growing them only for curiosity and for the beauty of the fruit. The Central American fruit\u2019s first appearance in a published English recipe was under the name love appleand used to dress haddock \u201cafter the Spanish Way\u201d by Hannah Glasse in the 1758 supplement to The Art of Cookery.[ii] By the 1780s, other tomato recipes appeared in British cookery manuscripts and the 1797 Encyclopedia Britannicaannounced the tomato was \u201cin daily use; being either boiled in soups or broths, or served up boiled as garnishes to flesh-meats.\u201d[iii] Despite their late bloom in English cuisine, white colonists rather commonly ate tomatoes in Jamaica and probably throughout the Caribbean. In the early eighteenth century, English naturalist Henry Barham confessed that he had eaten five or six raw tomatoes at a time in Jamaica, \u201cfull of pulpy juice, and of small seeds, which you swallow with the pulp, and have something of a gravy taste.\u201d[iv] The first known reference of the tomato in the mainland British North American colonies was by English herbalist William Salmon on his 1710 expedition of Carolina.[v] Linguistic evidence suggests the tomato was likely introduced to the American South from the Caribbean. Late seventeenth-century English, French, and German manuscripts all refer to the fruit as the love apple. and in fact the word tomatodid not receive linguistic prominence in England until the mid-nineteenth century. In contrast, almost all eighteenth-century Southern references used some variation of the Spanish- and Portuguese-origin-word for tomato.[vi] Part of indigenous gardens throughout the Caribbean, tomatoes were slowly adopted into the m\u00e9lange of colonial cooking. Contrary to prominent Southern food historian Sam Hillard\u2019s claims in his Hog Meat and Hoe Cake that the \u201ctomato was little used as a vegetable in antebellum times,\u201d tomato usage is well-documented in the early nineteenth-century American South.[vii] Among recipe manuscripts of antebellum Charlestonians, tomato cookery paralleled that of English cookery\u2013tomatoes were stewed with other ingredients such as fish, shrimp, beef, or egg dishes. Tomatoes also stood alone\u2013served fried, stewed, baked, or chopped. The most frequently reoccurring recipes for tomatoes, however, called for them to be preserved. For example, the receipt book of Mary Motte Alston Pringle includes three recipes for preserving tomatoes\u2013two for pickling and one for canning\u2013as well as a recipe for tomato catsup. In her recipe \u201cto Preserve Tomatoes,\u201d Pringle advocates scalding ripe tomatoes in hot water to easily remove the skins, boiling them in sugar or salt, then drying inch-thick cakes in the sun before packing the slices away in bags to hang in a dry place. This preparation suggests a later use for application in a dish calling for stewed tomatoes such as \u201cKnuckled Veal\u201d or \u201cBaked Shrimp and Tomatoes.\u201d[viii] Such recipes suggest the considerable effort required to transcend seasonality because of the centrality of tomatoes to dishes consumed in the antebellum South; women like Mary Motte Alston Pringle found the tomato a valuable component to their cuisine patterns and therefore practiced several methods to ensure its availability out of season. If this article has got you hankering for tomatoes in your next meal, an antebellum Southerner would advise you get a move on! In her recipe book, The Carolina Housewife 1847), Sarah Rutledge notes \u201cthe art of cooking tomatoes lies mostly in cooking them enough. In whatever way prepared, they should be put on some hours before dinner.\u201d[ix] To this twenty-first century academic, that means simmering on low in the crockpot!

Wieso es nun zur schlechten finanziellen Lage kam, ob noch Rettung f\u00fcr den Sender besteht und was man in Zukunft vielleicht am Konzept \u00fcberdenken sollte \u2013 dar\u00fcber philosophieren die beiden K\u00fcHe und k\u00fcmmern sich zudem um weitere kleine Neuigkeiten rund um die Flimmerkiste[30:00]. Das Segment Film widmet sich in Folge 27 dem von Herrn Hammes in Episode 26 so hochgelobten Kassenschlager \u201eAvatar\u201c. Dieser gilt n\u00e4mlich inzwischen weltweit als erfolgreichster Film [40:45] und hat \u201eTitanic\u201c auf Platz zwei verwiesen. Doch l\u00e4sst sich der erfolgreichste Film so einfach bestimmen? Nicht, wenn es um gewisse Faktoren geht, die man eigentlich mit einrechnen m\u00fcsste. Welche das sind, verraten die Beiden in investigativer Art und Weise. Zugleich wird ein Blick nach Deutschland geworfen \u2013 welcher Streifen konnte hier wohl die meisten Zuschauer in die Lichtspielh\u00e4user locken? Eine in der Tat \u00fcberraschende Top-20-Liste\u2026 Die Liste mit den Kandidaten, die den \u201eKuH der Woche\u201c[1:04:27] dieses Mal nicht landen konnten, ist lang. Doch ganz ohne Zweifel blieb nur ein Anw\u00e4rter f\u00fcr diese Auszeichnung \u00fcbrig: ein Synchrondolmetscher des MDR. Er \u00fcbersetzte die Rede von Michael Jacksons Schwester LaToya beim \u201eSemperopernball 2009\u201c sagen wir\u2026 \u201einnerhalb seiner M\u00f6glichkeiten\u201c nahezu perfekt. Und weil es so sympathisch ist, rufen K\u00f6rber und Hammes direkt zum Contest auf, bei dem ihr entscheiden m\u00fcsst, wer die \u00fcbersetzte Rede besser in eine neue Form brachte. Das dazugeh\u00f6rige Voting ist am Ende des Artikels als Link zu finden. Weitere Themen: Kino-Charts und -Starts; Herr Hammes pr\u00e4sentiert als DVD-Tipp den Heath-Ledger-Film \u201eDie vier Federn\u201c; \u201eDenver-Clan\u201c-Biest Joan Collins mit Gastauftritt bei \u201eVerbotene Liebe\u201c; der neue dpa-Chef gibt Leitfaden f\u00fcr die Redaktion raus; mal wieder beweist sich der Titelschmutz als vision\u00e4r; auch die Radiolandschaft erh\u00e4lt jetzt ihre Preisverleihung; Quotentipp: \u201eUnser Star f\u00fcr Oslo\u201c. Ach ja\u2026 irgendwo versteckt sich auch kurz das Apple iPad in der Sendung. Das Voting: \u2013 K\u00f6rber vs. Hammes \u2013 wer hat die MDR-Dolmetscher-Rede am besten vorgetragen? Stimmt hier ab!

        "structuredText": "<div> \n <p>Not too long from now, you or I will wake up a few minutes earlier than normal because Alexa, our voice-controlled home help, will already know it\u2019s raining and that the traffic will be heavy.</p> \n <p>As we step outside, our smartphone will direct us to the nearest Uber or, if we prefer, a Tesla electric car that is part of a shared on-demand fleet to which we subscribe.</p> \n <p>When we approach the office, \u2018our\u2019 car will guide itself to the nearest parking space. At lunchtime, we will book a weekend break on Airbnb and order some new summer clothes from Farfetch to be delivered to our destination, by drone, on the day we arrive.</p> \n <p>After work, we will stop at the new Amazon supermarket to pick up dinner. There are no cashiers. Sensors monitor what we pick and our Amazon Prime account, activated by our smartphone as we enter, is charged. When we finally get home we will catch up on our favourite Netflix drama.</p> \n <p>All the while we will be monitored as never before. The amount of our personal data that the tech giants harvest will reach 180 zettabytes \u2014 180 followed by 21 zeros \u2014 in just a few years\u2019 time, predicts IDC, a market-research firm. Big data \u2014 the capture, storage and commercial exploitation of our digital identities, to which we all too often agree every time we sign up to a new product or service \u2014 is getting so big it is not just helping Silicon Valley to create new, once unimaginable digital services, it is driving a new industrial revolution. \u2018Data is the new oil that drives the future, just as oil did in the past,\u2019 says Jonathan Taplin, author of Move Fast and Break Things: How Google, Facebook and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.</p> \n <p>Oil, along with electricity, forged the modern globalised world. It created modern global road, air, sea and space travel, refrigeration, elevators, pharmaceuticals, plastics, fabrics, cosmetics, the chemicals that clean the water we drink and fertilise the fields where our food grows, and much more besides. It helped to spawn the great icons of modern capitalism \u2014 GE, Ford, General Motors, Toyota, Volkswagen, Boeing, Airbus, Nasa, Otis, Bayer, Shell, BP, Exxon Mobil, GSK, Astra Zeneca. And on and on.</p> \n <p>Now big data threatens the old order and those old icons. It is fast replacing finance as the driver of business and market behaviour. The big, well-capitalised companies of today and yesterday risk being replaced by smaller start-ups, many of which use data to make new markets that they dominate, instead of making things. Uber is now more valuable than many traditional carmakers, even though it does not make cars. Airbnb, which is scarcely a decade old, is already finding more of us holiday accommodation each year than Hyatt, even though it owns no hotels. Netflix, Apple and Amazon are gnawing at the big broadcasters and Hollywood even though they do not own huge studios and cable companies. Spotify and iTunes are doing the same to traditional record labels, even though they have no roster of artists.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>New data-driven retailers threaten the old order. Amazon knows so much about us and has such whizzy new ideas that it now challenges every retailer, including supermarkets, the one sector that has, so far, resisted its advance. At its new cashierless \u2018ghost\u2019 supermarkets, the first of which is due to open in Seattle this spring, not only will we not have to queue, the store will know the foods we like and direct us to them when we walk in \u2014 even offering money off our favourites. Fashion and grooming start-ups \u2014 whether big, like Net-A-Porter or Farfetch, or small, like Dollar Shave Club \u2014 are knocking lumps out of some of the world\u2019s poshest brands because they use data to better target consumers with their often cheaper wares.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>As the new start-ups grow, a new cadre of billionaires is emerging, replacing the oil-dependent industrial barons of the past. Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Google\u2019s Sergey Brin and Larry Page, Bill Gates at Microsoft, Elon Musk of Tesla and Alibaba\u2019s Jack Ma now top the Forbes and Fortune lists of the wealthiest business leaders on the planet.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>What makes the data that we generate more valuable than black gold is that it is unique, personal, live, accurate and, thanks to the plummeting cost of storing and transporting it, can be traded cheaply. Anyone can find out who we are, where we are, what we like and offer us tailored new products and services as and when we might want them. Most of them time we sign up. The one big difference between oil and data \u2014 that data will never run out \u2014 oddly makes it more valuable because firms know they will always be able to exploit it.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The fast take-up of the new wave of data-driven services tempts tech evangelists to argue that big data makes our lives better. It can. The more data it has, the better Silicon Valley can predict our behaviour \u2014 and serve up new products, many now using artificial intelligence. But, alas, the past 12 months have shown big data can and all too often does unleash a cascade of forces that are making the world more dangerous and volatile.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>At a simple level, the more bytes we generate and companies collect, the more vulnerable it makes us to theft. Many people reading this magazine will have had their credit card details stolen at least once. Most thefts occur from company websites. The more advanced data services become, the greater the risk of hacks. Data-driven automated cars that rely on car-to-car data sharing have been hacked and the hackers have taken control of the brakes and the steering.</p> \n <p>Social media originally promised liberation. Remember the Facebook revolutions of the Arab Spring? But it has proved an even more useful tool for stoking anger. Many US analysts argue it was fake news, possibly generated in Russia and targeted to key voters using personal data, that swung the presidential election in favour of Donald Trump. British firm Cambridge Analytica is at the centre of a probe over its alleged involvement. Whatever we may think of the Tweeter-in-Chief, few of us welcome the idea of Moscow using social media to pick political winners in the west.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Scariest of all, just as global powers have historically battled for the control of oil resources and oil trading routes, so latter-day nation states are conspiring to control the data and cyber networks upon which governments and their citizens depend. Earlier this month, UK politicians voiced concerns after Global Switch, the data centre company owned by the billionaire Reuben brothers, sold a 49 per cent stake to a consortium of Chinese investors, despite concerns about national security.</p> \n <p>Britain\u2019s National Security Strategy makes cybercrime a Tier 1 threat, on a par with international terrorism and military crises, and a higher risk than nuclear attack. Last year\u2019s WannaCry attack on the NHS was linked to North Korea.</p> \n <p>There are other concerns, too. By giving away our data so easily, we have handed the five biggest tech firms \u2014 Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft \u2014 the kind of monopoly that Standard Oil, created by John D Rockefeller, enjoyed in the early 20th century. They are five of the most valuable listed firms in the world and have enormous power. Amazon determines how we shop, Google how we acquire knowledge, Facebook how we communicate.

        "text": "Not too long from now, you or I will wake up a few minutes earlier than normal because Alexa, our voice-controlled home help, will already know it\u2019s raining and that the traffic will be heavy. As we step outside, our smartphone will direct us to the nearest Uber or, if we prefer, a Tesla electric car that is part of a shared on-demand fleet to which we subscribe. When we approach the office, \u2018our\u2019 car will guide itself to the nearest parking space. At lunchtime, we will book a weekend break on Airbnb and order some new summer clothes from Farfetch to be delivered to our destination, by drone, on the day we arrive. After work, we will stop at the new Amazon supermarket to pick up dinner. There are no cashiers. Sensors monitor what we pick and our Amazon Prime account, activated by our smartphone as we enter, is charged. When we finally get home we will catch up on our favourite Netflix drama. All the while we will be monitored as never before. The amount of our personal data that the tech giants harvest will reach 180 zettabytes \u2014 180 followed by 21 zeros \u2014 in just a few years\u2019 time, predicts IDC, a market-research firm. Big data \u2014 the capture, storage and commercial exploitation of our digital identities, to which we all too often agree every time we sign up to a new product or service \u2014 is getting so big it is not just helping Silicon Valley to create new, once unimaginable digital services, it is driving a new industrial revolution. \u2018Data is the new oil that drives the future, just as oil did in the past,\u2019 says Jonathan Taplin, author of Move Fast and Break Things: How Google, Facebook and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy. Oil, along with electricity, forged the modern globalised world. It created modern global road, air, sea and space travel, refrigeration, elevators, pharmaceuticals, plastics, fabrics, cosmetics, the chemicals that clean the water we drink and fertilise the fields where our food grows, and much more besides. It helped to spawn the great icons of modern capitalism \u2014 GE, Ford, General Motors, Toyota, Volkswagen, Boeing, Airbus, Nasa, Otis, Bayer, Shell, BP, Exxon Mobil, GSK, Astra Zeneca. And on and on. Now big data threatens the old order and those old icons. It is fast replacing finance as the driver of business and market behaviour. The big, well-capitalised companies of today and yesterday risk being replaced by smaller start-ups, many of which use data to make new markets that they dominate, instead of making things. Uber is now more valuable than many traditional carmakers, even though it does not make cars. Airbnb, which is scarcely a decade old, is already finding more of us holiday accommodation each year than Hyatt, even though it owns no hotels. Netflix, Apple and Amazon are gnawing at the big broadcasters and Hollywood even though they do not own huge studios and cable companies. Spotify and iTunes are doing the same to traditional record labels, even though they have no roster of artists.\u00a0 New data-driven retailers threaten the old order. Amazon knows so much about us and has such whizzy new ideas that it now challenges every retailer, including supermarkets, the one sector that has, so far, resisted its advance. At its new cashierless \u2018ghost\u2019 supermarkets, the first of which is due to open in Seattle this spring, not only will we not have to queue, the store will know the foods we like and direct us to them when we walk in \u2014 even offering money off our favourites. Fashion and grooming start-ups \u2014 whether big, like Net-A-Porter or Farfetch, or small, like Dollar Shave Club \u2014 are knocking lumps out of some of the world\u2019s poshest brands because they use data to better target consumers with their often cheaper wares.\u00a0 As the new start-ups grow, a new cadre of billionaires is emerging, replacing the oil-dependent industrial barons of the past. Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Google\u2019s Sergey Brin and Larry Page, Bill Gates at Microsoft, Elon Musk of Tesla and Alibaba\u2019s Jack Ma now top the Forbes and Fortune lists of the wealthiest business leaders on the planet.\u00a0 What makes the data that we generate more valuable than black gold is that it is unique, personal, live, accurate and, thanks to the plummeting cost of storing and transporting it, can be traded cheaply. Anyone can find out who we are, where we are, what we like and offer us tailored new products and services as and when we might want them. Most of them time we sign up. The one big difference between oil and data \u2014 that data will never run out \u2014 oddly makes it more valuable because firms know they will always be able to exploit it.\u00a0 The fast take-up of the new wave of data-driven services tempts tech evangelists to argue that big data makes our lives better. It can. The more data it has, the better Silicon Valley can predict our behaviour \u2014 and serve up new products, many now using artificial intelligence. But, alas, the past 12 months have shown big data can and all too often does unleash a cascade of forces that are making the world more dangerous and volatile.\u00a0 At a simple level, the more bytes we generate and companies collect, the more vulnerable it makes us to theft. Many people reading this magazine will have had their credit card details stolen at least once. Most thefts occur from company websites. The more advanced data services become, the greater the risk of hacks. Data-driven automated cars that rely on car-to-car data sharing have been hacked and the hackers have taken control of the brakes and the steering. Social media originally promised liberation. Remember the Facebook revolutions of the Arab Spring? But it has proved an even more useful tool for stoking anger. Many US analysts argue it was fake news, possibly generated in Russia and targeted to key voters using personal data, that swung the presidential election in favour of Donald Trump. British firm Cambridge Analytica is at the centre of a probe over its alleged involvement. Whatever we may think of the Tweeter-in-Chief, few of us welcome the idea of Moscow using social media to pick political winners in the west.\u00a0 Scariest of all, just as global powers have historically battled for the control of oil resources and oil trading routes, so latter-day nation states are conspiring to control the data and cyber networks upon which governments and their citizens depend. Earlier this month, UK politicians voiced concerns after Global Switch, the data centre company owned by the billionaire Reuben brothers, sold a 49 per cent stake to a consortium of Chinese investors, despite concerns about national security. Britain\u2019s National Security Strategy makes cybercrime a Tier 1 threat, on a par with international terrorism and military crises, and a higher risk than nuclear attack. Last year\u2019s WannaCry attack on the NHS was linked to North Korea. There are other concerns, too. By giving away our data so easily, we have handed the five biggest tech firms \u2014 Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft \u2014 the kind of monopoly that Standard Oil, created by John D Rockefeller, enjoyed in the early 20th century. They are five of the most valuable listed firms in the world and have enormous power. Amazon determines how we shop, Google how we acquire knowledge, Facebook how we communicate. Their concentrated authority also means they can see when a new product or service gains traction, allowing them to copy it or simply buy the upstart before it becomes too great a threat. That\u2019s what Facebook did with Instagram and WhatsApp. It made them an offer they couldn\u2019t refuse and swallowed them whole. \u2018The super-platforms wield too much power,\u2019 says Ariel Ezrachi of the University of Oxford and author of Virtual Competition: The Promise and Perils of the Algorithm-Driven Economy. Is there anything we can do? Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, author of the best-selling book, Big Data, and other data experts want a change in regulation.

Brunch allows you to choose two small dishes and one larger dish each, followed by pudding, along with bottomless pineapple sake or prosecco for \u00a335. Highlights include a tender and sticky Korean-style short rib, a buttermilk-fried chicken roll and miso aubergine. Go in a group and share for best results. Sat and Sun, 8am-3pm / 10am-3pm Golborne Road Danish restaurant Snaps & Rye combines its breakfast and brunch menu. Danish pastries and smoked salmon with scrambled eggs sit alongside a Full Danish consisting of bacon, liquorice syrup, hog's pudding, spinach, tomatoes, pickled mushrooms and what they like to call Bloody Viking Ketchup. The open sandwiches are also worth a look. 93 Golborne Road, W10 5NL; snapsandrye.com Saturday, midday-3.30pm\u00a0 Don\u2019t expect eggs Benedict at this Jason Atherton joint. This isn\u2019t standard brunch fare, but rather the same brand of modern tapas the restaurant does so well, served at brunch o\u2019clock. It comes in the guise of a \u00a320 Feed Me menu, which will see a surprise selection of head chef Frankie Van Loo\u2019s favourite plates brought to the table to share. These could include tangy piquillo croquettas, rare slices of Cumbrian lamb rump with goat\u2019s cured and spicy hummus, or a runny-yolked egg on brioche with chorizo jam and avocado. Make sure you end on the churros-esque cinnamon doughnuts, and do make the most of the extensive wine list. Know a great brunch spot we haven\u2019t included?

Brunch classics from Benedict to buttermilk pancakes are all served with flair while there\u2019s also a hefty offering of steaks from the grill to round things off. Oh, and since you\u2019re splashing out do make sure you sup some Champagne from the specially designed Kate Moss coupes\u2026</p> \n<p>Sat and Sun, 10am-4pm</p> \n<p>Brunch at the original Balthazar in Manhattan is a New York institution and its Covent Garden outpost is proving pretty popular too. Take in the bustle of the grand space as you pile in pastries from the adjoining bakery, fluffy pancakes drenched in maple syrup, or eggs whatever way.

Highlights include Nuno\u2019s now legendary crab-stuffed doughnuts, a mix-your-own steak tartare and black truffle scrambled eggs.

        "text": "Londoners love nothing more than a good brunch, be they brilliantly boozy or vibrant and virtuous. Ok, we\u2019ll admit the former are particularly popular. More restaurants across London are getting their brunch on than ever before, but while that means we are all spoilt for choice it also presents the need to prioritise finding the most pitch-perfect of them all. After all, no one wants to see in the weekend with a hard yolk or waste their cash on\u00a0a watery Bloody Mary. The best food in London, from roasts and pizza to healthy dishes, veggie dining and cakes With that in mind we have compiled the ultimate guide to London\u2019s best brunches \u2014 from Benedict, banana pancakes and avo on toast to limitless sushi, barbecue nosh and mid-morning tapas. Flick through the gallery above to see our selection in pictures, browse alphabetically, or use the map below to choose your destination by location. The brunches marked in red on the map are bottomless.\u00a0 Sat and Sun, midday-5pm For sheer decadence, it\u2019s hard to beat Mayfair\u2019s 34. Brunch classics from Benedict to buttermilk pancakes are all served with flair while there\u2019s also a hefty offering of steaks from the grill to round things off. Oh, and since you\u2019re splashing out do make sure you sup some Champagne from the specially designed Kate Moss coupes\u2026 Sat and Sun, 10am-4pm Brunch at the original Balthazar in Manhattan is a New York institution and its Covent Garden outpost is proving pretty popular too. Take in the bustle of the grand space as you pile in pastries from the adjoining bakery, fluffy pancakes drenched in maple syrup, or eggs whatever way. Choose between fresh juices or cocktails to wash it all down.\u00a0 4-6 Russell Street, WC2B 5HZ; balthazarlondon.com\u00a0 Sat and Sun, 9am-4pm So laid back it\u2019s almost horizontal, few places are better suited to brunch than Ben\u2019s Canteen.

Branches in Battersea and Earlsfield; benscanteen.com\u00a0 Sat and Sun, 11am-3pm Along with many of the main menu\u2019s slow-cooked, seductively spiced meats, tasty dips and fluffy breads, brunch has some special dishes to offer.

Crossrail Place, E14 5AR; bigeasy.co.uk\u00a0 Sat and Sun, 11am-4pm\u00a0 You\u2019ll need to book for the almighty brunches at Bistrotheque. Try classics with a twist such as avocado on toast with sriracha chilli sauce or go for something less tried and tested like crab rarebit with rocket and capers. The steak tartare is also exemplary.\u00a0 23-27 Wadeson Street, E2 9DR; bistrotheque.com Sat and Sun, 10am-4pm What you eat at Caravan will depend how virtuous or gluttinous you\u2019re feeling. Fresh fruits and almond milk porridge rub shoulders with eggs, spreads or a particularly delicious avocado, chilli, lemon and olive oil.

The heat is slightly less fierce now, but the brunch is still as good a call as any. Highlights include Nuno\u2019s now legendary crab-stuffed doughnuts, a mix-your-own steak tartare and black truffle scrambled eggs.

It\u2019s technically a breakfast (but it\u2019s so good we had to include it) so only runs until midday. Early bird catches the naan, and all that...

        "text": "El a\u00f1o 2020 ser\u00e1 clave para la implantaci\u00f3n del coche totalmente conectado. Para esa fecha la implantaci\u00f3n del sistema de comunicaci\u00f3n 5G va a permitir la conectividad total con los veh\u00edculos y entre los propios veh\u00edculos, con el objetivo final del coche aut\u00f3nomo de nivel 5, es decir, capaz de circular sin necesidad de la intervenci\u00f3n humana. Y aunque las marcas han creado planes bastante ambiciosos para ponerse a la cabeza de la carrera hacia el coche aut\u00f3nomo porque ya es posible recorrer una ciudad congestionada como Tokio en un coche aut\u00f3nomo, sin necesidad de tocar el volante ni los pedales, ni siquiera los intermitentes, todav\u00eda resulta un tanto complejo discernir a qu\u00e9 distancia se encuentran realmente delograreste gran cambio en el sector de la automoci\u00f3n.

Sin duda, la conducci\u00f3n automatizada traer\u00e1 muchas ventajas, pero para que podamos ir al volante de un coche sin conducir, es necesario mucho m\u00e1s que incorporar sistemas de asistencia a la conducci\u00f3n.

There has been a pub on the site since 1423 and the pie has been on the menu for an impressive number of those years \u2014 the recipe hasn\u2019t even changed in the last thirty of them. It boasts a rich filling under a flaky suet pastry lid.</p> \n<p>30 Bruton Place, W1J 6NL;&nbsp;theguinea.co.uk\u200b</p> \n<p>Likely to ring a bell with dedicated Arsenal fans, this pun-tastic pie shop started life as a hugely popular match day food stall operating in the front garden of a family home close to the old Highbury stadium. In 2012, Piebury Corner launched a permanent site in Holloway Road, with another opening in Kings Cross last year. An extensive menu boasts four types of steak pies alone (from Stilton to stout), spicy variations including a Porter-marinaded jerk chicken filling, with vegan and gluten free options available too.</p> \n<p>Some pies come with mash, some come with chips \u2013 but this pie comes with legions of celebrity fans and the weight of being one of most iconic dishes on the London dining scene. The Shepherd\u2019s Pie at <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/restaurants/the-ivy-review-100-years-of-playing-it-cool-a3696321.html\">The Ivy</a> has been serving up comfort food to many a famous face for decades, and is reportedly a favourite of one <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/gordon-ramsay\">Gordon Ramsay</a>. The magic of this pie is also what makes it nominally peculiar \u2013 it\u2019s not entirely a Shepherd\u2019s Pie. The dish is made with both lamb and beef mince \u2013 so wrong, but so right.</p> \n<p>\u200b1-5 West Street, WC2H 9NQ;&nbsp;the-ivy.co.uk</p> \n<p>Never mind the best pies in London, Putney Pies is laying all its cards on the table by purporting to serve \u201cthe finest pies in the land\u201d. It is certainly difficult to beat for atmospheric location, as diners make their way into an arched vault beside the river Thames, a setting ripe for pie-eating. Choose between shortcrust, puff or pot pies with fillings including classic steak and ale, a Mexican-inspired chilli pie, and a wild rabbit and apple pie.</p> \n<p>2 Putney High Street, SW15 1SL;&nbsp;putneypies.co.uk</p> \n<p>When it comes to pies, no man (or woman) should be left behind. Camden-based pie purveyors <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/restaurants/where-to-get-the-best-vegan-junk-food-in-london-a3745181.html\">Young Vegans</a> know this, and you can guess who they cater to. Their pies are totally animal product free, with fillings including seitan and ale, sweet potato, veggie curry and and \u201cAll Day Breakfast\u201d pie featuring scrambled tofu, smokey baked beans, caramelised onions and vegan sausage.</p> \n<p>60 Camden Lock Place, NW1 8AF;&nbsp;youngvegans.co.uk</p> \n<p>It\u2019s pie day every day at <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/restaurants/quo-vadis-soho-tried-and-tasted-a3679191.html\">Quo&nbsp;Vadis</a>, with chef Jeremy Lee knocking up a daily-changing seasonal special. Whether the pie be beef, chicken and tarragon or something else entirely, a glossy, flaky lid is par for the course. It gets better \u2014 the pie is half price every Monday, making it under a tenner.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>26-29 Dean Street,&nbsp;W1D&nbsp;3LL; quovadissoho.co.uk</p> \n<p>Residents of Battersea, don\u2019t get your hopes up on this one \u2013 the Battersea Pie Station is actually in <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/covent-garden\">Covent Garden</a>. Pies come in at low prices (a pleasant surprise considering its prime location in the heart of the market), with a plethora of additions available: if you\u2019re all mashed out, swap it in for glistening roasted potatoes with garlic and rosemary or a spinach, pea and feta salad. Nearby deskbound-lunchbreakers hit the jackpot as the Station offers delivery too. A steak and Meantime stout pie delivered to your door? Don\u2019t mind if we do.</p> \n<p>28 The Market, WC2E 8RA;&nbsp;batterseapiestation.co.uk</p> \n<p>It\u2019s impossible to list London\u2019s best pies without making reference to one of the capital\u2019s classic pie, mash and eel shops. While there are a scattering across the city, it\u2019s the&nbsp;Manze&nbsp;family which deserve special mention \u2014 the original shop opened by Michele&nbsp;Manze&nbsp;on Tower Bridge Road in 1891 is the oldest to still exist. If you\u2019re going to pay just one shop a visit, though, perhaps it should be M&nbsp;Manze&nbsp;in&nbsp;Walthamstow, which dates back to 1929 and has such a preserved interior that it\u2019s been awarded a Grade II listing.</p> \n<p>76 High Street,&nbsp;E17&nbsp;7LD\u200b;&nbsp;manze.co.uk</p> \n<p>Calum&nbsp;Franklin, executive head chef at <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/rosewood-london\">Rosewood London</a>\u2019s brasserie-style restaurant, is a master when it comes to British classics. His sausage rolls and a vast and varying selection of pies are among his biggest triumphs, especially his take on a pork pie, made with pork shoulder, pork leg, pancetta and smoked ham hock as well as fennel seeds. The salty, deep-flavoured meat and buttery pastry are a perfect pairing. So loved are they&nbsp;at the restaurant, that it will soon be opening The Pie Room, where visitors will be able to watch chefs make their legendary pies.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>252 High&nbsp;Holborn,&nbsp;WC1V&nbsp;7EN;&nbsp;holborndiningroom.com</p> \n<p>This <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/mayfair\">Mayfair</a>&nbsp;pub loves pies so much that it runs a pie club offering regular tastings, events and seasonal specials. Its take on the classic steak and kidney pie \u2014 fully encased in a rich suet crust \u2014 has won at the National Pie Awards numerous times, and it\u2019s not hard to see why.</p> \n<p>6-8 Mill Street, W1S 2AZ;&nbsp;windmillmayfair.co.uk</p> \n<p>Pies aren\u2019t all about meat and pastry \u2014 sometimes you just can\u2019t beat seafood and potatoes. Theatreland favourite <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/restaurants/grace-dent-reviews-j-sheekey-newly-tweaked-but-its-essence-continues-a3679086.html\">J Sheekey</a> has made its fish pie a signature, and it might be the capital's best. Think big chunks of juicy fish, plenty of creamy sauce and a crisped upper crust for extra bite.</p> \n<p>28-32 St Martin's Court, WC2N 4AL; j-sheekey.co.uk</p> \n<p>Nowhere in London is the pie more at home than in the East End. Family-run&nbsp;Goddards&nbsp;at Greenwich has been catering to the pie connoisseurs since 1890, and specialises in a traditional minced meat pie, mash and liquor (no, not whisky, but a traditional parsley sauce).

        "text": "It\u2019s National Pie Day in the States today, and that\u2019s got us thinking. Americans may like to think pie is as American as, well, apple pie, but us Brits have an illustrious history of pie making (and eating) that we\u2019re proudly continuing to this day. We\u2019re pretty sure we can serve them some humble pie (literally) in this respect \u2013 who needs cherry when you can have steak and kidney, pork or even eel? Take a look at some of the best places to get a hearty helping of pie in the capital. There\u00a0isn\u2019t much humble about flashy Bob Bob\u00a0Ricard\u00a0(see top of page), and its humble pie \u2013\u00a0made with truffle and sauternes \u2013\u00a0is no exception. Mushrooms, pecorino cheese, leeks and pearl barley add bulk and creaminess, while a prettily decorated crust gives a final flourish. Vegetarians are likely to be particularly smitten.\u00a0 1 Upper James Street,\u00a0W1F\u00a09DF;\u00a0bobbobricard.com Pies are in the Guinea\u2019s genes and the steak and kidney variety at this Mayfair pub is not only award-winning, it\u2019s also historic. There has been a pub on the site since 1423 and the pie has been on the menu for an impressive number of those years \u2014 the recipe hasn\u2019t even changed in the last thirty of them. It boasts a rich filling under a flaky suet pastry lid. 30 Bruton Place, W1J 6NL;\u00a0theguinea.co.uk\u200b Likely to ring a bell with dedicated Arsenal fans, this pun-tastic pie shop started life as a hugely popular match day food stall operating in the front garden of a family home close to the old Highbury stadium. In 2012, Piebury Corner launched a permanent site in Holloway Road, with another opening in Kings Cross last year. An extensive menu boasts four types of steak pies alone (from Stilton to stout), spicy variations including a Porter-marinaded jerk chicken filling, with vegan and gluten free options available too. Some pies come with mash, some come with chips \u2013 but this pie comes with legions of celebrity fans and the weight of being one of most iconic dishes on the London dining scene. The Shepherd\u2019s Pie at The Ivy has been serving up comfort food to many a famous face for decades, and is reportedly a favourite of one Gordon Ramsay. The magic of this pie is also what makes it nominally peculiar \u2013 it\u2019s not entirely a Shepherd\u2019s Pie. The dish is made with both lamb and beef mince \u2013 so wrong, but so right. \u200b1-5 West Street, WC2H 9NQ;\u00a0the-ivy.co.uk Never mind the best pies in London, Putney Pies is laying all its cards on the table by purporting to serve \u201cthe finest pies in the land\u201d. It is certainly difficult to beat for atmospheric location, as diners make their way into an arched vault beside the river Thames, a setting ripe for pie-eating. Choose between shortcrust, puff or pot pies with fillings including classic steak and ale, a Mexican-inspired chilli pie, and a wild rabbit and apple pie. 2 Putney High Street, SW15 1SL;\u00a0putneypies.co.uk When it comes to pies, no man (or woman) should be left behind. Camden-based pie purveyors Young Vegans know this, and you can guess who they cater to. Their pies are totally animal product free, with fillings including seitan and ale, sweet potato, veggie curry and and \u201cAll Day Breakfast\u201d pie featuring scrambled tofu, smokey baked beans, caramelised onions and vegan sausage. 60 Camden Lock Place, NW1 8AF;\u00a0youngvegans.co.uk It\u2019s pie day every day at Quo\u00a0Vadis, with chef Jeremy Lee knocking up a daily-changing seasonal special. Whether the pie be beef, chicken and tarragon or something else entirely, a glossy, flaky lid is par for the course. It gets better \u2014 the pie is half price every Monday, making it under a tenner.\u00a0 26-29 Dean Street,\u00a0W1D\u00a03LL; quovadissoho.co.uk Residents of Battersea, don\u2019t get your hopes up on this one \u2013 the Battersea Pie Station is actually in Covent Garden. Pies come in at low prices (a pleasant surprise considering its prime location in the heart of the market), with a plethora of additions available: if you\u2019re all mashed out, swap it in for glistening roasted potatoes with garlic and rosemary or a spinach, pea and feta salad. Nearby deskbound-lunchbreakers hit the jackpot as the Station offers delivery too. A steak and Meantime stout pie delivered to your door? Don\u2019t mind if we do. 28 The Market, WC2E 8RA;\u00a0batterseapiestation.co.uk It\u2019s impossible to list London\u2019s best pies without making reference to one of the capital\u2019s classic pie, mash and eel shops. While there are a scattering across the city, it\u2019s the\u00a0Manze\u00a0family which deserve special mention \u2014 the original shop opened by Michele\u00a0Manze\u00a0on Tower Bridge Road in 1891 is the oldest to still exist. If you\u2019re going to pay just one shop a visit, though, perhaps it should be M\u00a0Manze\u00a0in\u00a0Walthamstow, which dates back to 1929 and has such a preserved interior that it\u2019s been awarded a Grade II listing. 76 High Street,\u00a0E17\u00a07LD\u200b;\u00a0manze.co.uk Calum\u00a0Franklin, executive head chef at Rosewood London\u2019s brasserie-style restaurant, is a master when it comes to British classics. His sausage rolls and a vast and varying selection of pies are among his biggest triumphs, especially his take on a pork pie, made with pork shoulder, pork leg, pancetta and smoked ham hock as well as fennel seeds. The salty, deep-flavoured meat and buttery pastry are a perfect pairing. So loved are they\u00a0at the restaurant, that it will soon be opening The Pie Room, where visitors will be able to watch chefs make their legendary pies.\u00a0 252 High\u00a0Holborn,\u00a0WC1V\u00a07EN;\u00a0holborndiningroom.com This Mayfair\u00a0pub loves pies so much that it runs a pie club offering regular tastings, events and seasonal specials. Its take on the classic steak and kidney pie \u2014 fully encased in a rich suet crust \u2014 has won at the National Pie Awards numerous times, and it\u2019s not hard to see why. 6-8 Mill Street, W1S 2AZ;\u00a0windmillmayfair.co.uk Pies aren\u2019t all about meat and pastry \u2014 sometimes you just can\u2019t beat seafood and potatoes. Theatreland favourite J Sheekey has made its fish pie a signature, and it might be the capital's best. Think big chunks of juicy fish, plenty of creamy sauce and a crisped upper crust for extra bite. 28-32 St Martin's Court, WC2N 4AL; j-sheekey.co.uk Nowhere in London is the pie more at home than in the East End. Family-run\u00a0Goddards\u00a0at Greenwich has been catering to the pie connoisseurs since 1890, and specialises in a traditional minced meat pie, mash and liquor (no, not whisky, but a traditional parsley sauce). If you\u2019re seriously in the mood for pie, you can upgrade your pie and mash up to triple pie and mash, and still pay just \u00a38. A side of eels \u2013 hot or jellied \u2013 is naturally obligatory.\u00a0 22 King William Walk, SE10 9HU;\u00a0goddardsatgreenwich.co.uk Let\u2019s not forget that pies can be sweet, too.

You need to approach each goal differently from a design and development point of view.\u201d</p> \n <p>\u201cThe hierarchy of a Landing Page is critical to its success, so it\u2019s very important for the client to decide what their ultimate goal is in developing the page.\u201d</p> \n <p>This core goal is what will guide your entire design process and ensure that once you do launch, you know whether it was successful or not.</p> \n <p>The first thing you should do when building a new landing page? Know your goal.</p> \n <p>The second? Know your audience.</p> \n <p>Just like you need to be clear about what you want to get out of this page, you need to put yourself in your audience\u2019s shoes and think what they want to get out of it.

I think \u2018right\u2019 to them means whatever is considered conventional in that space,\u201d explains Simone.</p> \n <p>\u201cI think we all have a predetermined idea of what a landing page looks like but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s the right approach.\u201d</p> \n <p>\u201cDesign is critical here to cut-through the competition. You can achieve this through illustration, video, or typography\u2014there is no set formula.</p> \n <p>\u201cIn my opinion none of this should be formulaic because every business is different and more importantly every audience is different. Apple shouldn\u2019t be following the same formula as a small coffee brand and so on.\u201d</p> \n <p>\u201cClean and minimal is typically best, but often we undervalue remaining innovative,\u201d adds Shar.</p> \n <p>\u201cWe tend to reserve this for the main website itself, but it\u2019s important for landing pages and all digital advertising (banners and pop-ups) as well. My current favorite email capture page is by, Lenny.\u201d</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Once you\u2019ve grabbed a user\u2019s attention and convinced them to stick around, the real work begins.</p> \n <p>\u201cWhen it comes to designing great landing pages our main rule of thumbs is to consider the term \u2018surface delight\u2019 and to reduce the level of pain for the user. Questions we always try to ask ourselves are: \u2018does this make it a better experience?\u2019 and \u2018Does it add value to the brand?\u2019\u201d explains Jesper Balzer, Managing Director of <a href=\"http://ajukreizi.com/\">ajukreizi</a>, a Copenhagen-based agency that has worked with clients like Universal Music and Roskilde Festival.</p> \n <p>When Jesper and his team were commissioned by Foodscene to build a landing page for their complex food app, they decided to hone in on the emotions of the brand, using a fullscreen video to push users to download the app.</p> \n <p>The result is a conversion rate where 1/3 visitors from the landing page convert to paying customers.</p> \n <p>Similarly, when Simone was asked to creating a landing page for the Science Gallery Dublin there wasn\u2019t a clear \u2018ask\u2019 other than to get users engaged. So they focused on creating a unique user experience.</p> \n <p>\u201cThis may seem bizarre to some but the Science Gallery know their audience. They\u2019re young, curious and consider themselves different to the rest of their peers. So the brief was to create a landing page that resonated with this particular audience.\u201d</p> \n <p>\u201cOur job as designers and developers was to come up with a landing page that would act as a gateway into the exhibition microsite. If we did our jobs well, then our user would be so engaged by the landing page they\u2019d want to continue through to the site and explore the exhibition online before visiting the Science Gallery in reality.\u201d</p> \n <p></p> \n <p></p> \n <p>In both of these cases, the designer <a href=\"https://crew.co/blog/branding-for-small-businesses/\">channeled the client\u2019s brand</a> to create a page that enhanced the experience for users who were already interested.</p> \n <p>For Shar, utilizing what a brand already has\u2014the emotions connected to it, what customers already think of it\u2014is a core part of what makes a landing page successful.</p> \n <p>\u201cBranding is by far the biggest SEO strategy today, including a beautifully written story and visual experience that\u2019s consistent across all digital platforms. A brand\u2019s ties to people\u2019s search history and queries directly relate to who will see their content, especially their landing pages.</p> \n <p>A successful landing page is a living organism. You can\u2019t just set it and forget it, hoping that it does what you planned it to.</p> \n <p>Measuring and learning from data is one of the most important ways to get the most out of your campaign.</p> \n <p>And while you will already know what your key success metric is based on step 1, you can track other metrics to track to see whether or not your design is helping or hindering your cause.</p> \n <p>\u201cThe biggest design metric I think about is the bounce rate in relation to mobile versus desktop. If you find users leaving your landing pages on mobile quicker than desktop, there is likely a problem with the user experience on the mobile page,\u201d explains Shar.</p> \n <p>\u201cIf there are low conversions on the landing page all together, that could mean many things. But primarily it means you aren\u2019t presenting the users with the information they want or find valuable. Sometimes it\u2019s the smaller things like, your capture form is too long, or there is too much information on the landing page.\u201d</p> \n <p>Google Analytics will let you track things like bounce and exit rates. But if you want to go even deeper, both Simone and Jesper suggest using a service like Hotjar, which gives you a breakdown of where users are \u2018hot\u2019 or \u2018cold\u2019 on your site.</p> \n <p>\u201cThis is great for ascertaining drop off areas and even basic areas to watch out for like the user journey,\u201d explains Simone.</p> \n <p>To break it all down, a good landing page design needs 5 things:</p> \n <p>The one thing you should take away from all this is that landing pages can\u2019t be based on cookie cutter designs. Each page needs to balance your goals and what your users want and need.</p> \n <p>A great landing page design delights and informs. It gives your user what they were looking for instead of tricking them into signing up for something they don\u2019t.</p>  \n</div>",

And while you will already know what your key success metric is based on step 1, you can track other metrics to track to see whether or not your design is helping or hindering your cause. \u201cThe biggest design metric I think about is the bounce rate in relation to mobile versus desktop. If you find users leaving your landing pages on mobile quicker than desktop, there is likely a problem with the user experience on the mobile page,\u201d explains Shar. \u201cIf there are low conversions on the landing page all together, that could mean many things. But primarily it means you aren\u2019t presenting the users with the information they want or find valuable. Sometimes it\u2019s the smaller things like, your capture form is too long, or there is too much information on the landing page.\u201d Google Analytics will let you track things like bounce and exit rates. But if you want to go even deeper, both Simone and Jesper suggest using a service like Hotjar, which gives you a breakdown of where users are \u2018hot\u2019 or \u2018cold\u2019 on your site. \u201cThis is great for ascertaining drop off areas and even basic areas to watch out for like the user journey,\u201d explains Simone. To break it all down, a good landing page design needs 5 things: The one thing you should take away from all this is that landing pages can\u2019t be based on cookie cutter designs. Each page needs to balance your goals and what your users want and need. A great landing page design delights and informs.

Know your goal.</p> \n <p>The second? Know your audience.</p> \n <p>Just like you need to be clear about what you want to get out of this page, you need to put yourself in your audience\u2019s shoes and think what they want to get out of it. Why should they stick around and give you what you\u2019re after?</p> \n <p>The more you know about your target audience, the better chance a designer has at creating something that speaks directly to them.

Dai <a href=\"https://www.wired.it/mobile/app/2018/01/16/app-contraccettiva-gravidanze-indesiderate/\">media</a> sono stati riportati 37 casi, 51 sono invece quelli di cui si parla nel <a href=\"http://blog.naturalcycles.com/official-statement-on-the-current-media-attention/\">comunicato ufficiale</a> dell\u2019azienda produttrice, la Natural Cycles, la quale promette di rispondere in materia per ciascuno di quelli segnalati alla Medical Product Agency (Mpa), l\u2019agenzia per il controllo di farmaci e dispositivi medici svedese. Ma Natural Cycles ha da subito precisato anche come, a dispetto degli strilli dei giornali e della sua stessa certificazione europea rivendicata,nessun metodo contraccettivo \u00e8 efficace al 100%. Nel dettaglio la app finita sotto i riflettori rivendica percentuali di efficacia del 93% in media, 99% per un uso perfetto, in cui tradotto si utilizzino sempre protezione durante i giorni rossi, quelli pi\u00f9 fertili in cui si rischia di rimanere incinta (ma non \u00e8 detto che bastino, vedremo).</p> \n <p> Ma non c\u2019\u00e8 solo Natural Cycles: gli store di Google Play, Apple e simili abbondano di app che registrano i cicli mestruali, identificando i giorni fertili e stimano le probabilit\u00e0 dirimanere incinta. Ma non sono tutti uguali e non funzionano tutti allo stesso modo. Fino a che punto possiamo fidarcene?</p> \n <p>Da sole non bastano<br> Poco pi\u00f9 di un anno fa sul tema si esprimeva un <a href=\"http://www.jabfm.org/content/29/4/508.long\">paper</a> pubblicato su Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine. Nello studio i ricercatori <a href=\"https://www.wired.it/mobile/app/2016/07/05/app-periodo-fertile-non-sono-affidabili/\">avevano passato in rassegna</a> l\u2019efficacia di diverse app e siti presenti nei principali store e in rete, escludendo dalle analisi quelle che nei disclaimer invitavano a non utilizzarle come metodo contraccettivo.</p> \n <p> Negli store infatti abbondano le app che tracciano i giorni fertili, ma alcune sono per lo pi\u00f9 solo calendari per registrare le mestruazionie sintomi correlati. Dall\u2019analisi erano escluse anche le app che non dichiaravano di utilizzare un metodo basato sul riconoscimento della fertilit\u00e0 (in inglese, fertility awareness based methods, Fabm) evidence-based (ci torneremo). Il risultato lasciava spazio a poche interpretazioni: delle 40 analizzate <a href=\"http://www.jabfm.org/content/29/4/508/T2.expansion.html\">solo sei</a> erano in grado di raggiungere il punteggio massimo in termini di accuratezza \u2013 capacit\u00e0 di identificare i giorni fertili \u2013 e assenza di falsi negativi, ovvero giorni fertili scambiati come infertili. In sostanza, concludevano gli autori, affidarsi unicamente alle app per conoscere e gestire la propria fertilit\u00e0, senza essere preparate, potrebbe non essere sufficiente a evitare una gravidanza. Senza considerare che i <a href=\"https://www.wired.it/scienza/medicina/2014/04/30/mini-guida-alla-contraccezione/\">metodi contraccettivi</a> basati sulla fertilit\u00e0 hanno percentuali diverse di efficacia e che diversi fattori possono modificare queste percentuali.</p> \n <p>Riconoscere la fertilit\u00e0<br> Piacciono perch\u00e9 sono naturali, costano praticamente nulla e <a href=\"https://www.wired.it/lifestyle/salute/2014/12/11/miglior-metodo-contraccettivo-mio-smartphone/\">senza effetti collaterali</a> (non in senso classico, ma anche su questo torneremo dopo). Tutti i vari metodi basati sul riconoscimento della fertilit\u00e0 funzionano in modo simile e anche relativamente semplice: permettono di calcolare quando una donna \u00e8 nei suoi giorni fertili e dunque quella in cui pu\u00f2 rimanere incinta. Un\u2019informazione questa che pu\u00f2 pu\u00f2 essere usata in due modi diversi: per aumentare le probabilit\u00e0 di una gravidanza, per chi \u00e8 in cerca di un bambino, o per evitarla. In quest\u2019ultimo caso conoscere questa informazione significherebbe a sua volta che durante i giorni pi\u00f9 fertili o ci si astenga dall\u2019avere rapporti o si ricorra a contraccettivi che facciano da barriera fisica, come il preservativo. Parentesi: anche i preservativi non sono efficaci al 100%: l\u2019Organizzazione mondiale della sanit\u00e0 <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs351/en/\">parla</a> di percentuali che si aggirano intorno al 98% per un uso corretto, che scendono al una media dell\u201985% in media per i preservativi maschili. Percentuali nettamente pi\u00f9 basse si registrano nel caso del preservativo femminile: 90% in caso di uso corretto, d\u2019abitudine 79%.</p> \n <p>Tornano ai metodi basati sul riconoscimento dei propri giorni fertili ne esistono diversi, e diversi sono quelli su cui si basano molte delle appsul tema, che sono per lo pi\u00f9 utilizzate per registrare i sintomi e fare i calcoli al posto nostro, combinando i dati non solo relativi all\u2019ovulazione ma anche alla sopravvivenza dello sperma nell\u2019organismo umano (fino a 5 giorni) e tenendo conto pi\u00f9 o meno di margini di irregolarit\u00e0. In realt\u00e0 molto spesso le app permettono di registrare una gran quantit\u00e0 di dati: se si \u00e8 avuto un rapporto, ma anche la presenza di mal di testa, gonfiori e umore. La <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Fertility-Awareness-Based-Methods-of-Family-Planning#fertility\">lista-guida</a> compilata dall\u2019American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \u00e8 un buon punto di partenza per ricapitolare quali i metodi di riconoscimento della fertilit\u00e0 pi\u00f9 diffusi, anche tra le app. Tradizionalmente se ne identificano quattro, con possibili varianti al loro interno: il metodo del calendario (come quello dei giorni standard), il metodo del muco cervicale, il metodo della temperatura basale, il metodo sintotermico.</p> \n <p>I metodi<br> Il metodo dei giorni standard \u00e8 un esempio del <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/rhythm-method/about/pac-20390918\">metodo del calendario</a>, che mirano in generale a tener traccia solo temporale dei cicli mestruali per identificare i giorni pi\u00f9 fertili (come il caro vecchio Ogino-Knaus). Tradizionalmente, per un ciclo di durata compresa tra i 26 e i 32 giorni quelli tra l\u2019ottavo e il diciannovesimo vengono considerati come i pi\u00f9 fertili, a rischio gravidanza. Per tener traccia in quale giorno del mese ci troviamo esistono modi diversi: dalle CycleBeads, una sorta di collanine colorate, pi\u00f9 o meno digitali, che aiutano a identificare i giorni pi\u00f9 o meno fertili o, di nuovo alle app. Quanto funziona un metodo del genere? Fino al 95% nel migliore dei casi, intorno all\u201988% nella media.</p> \n <p>Il metodo del muco cervicale<br> Durante l\u2019ovulazione, il periodo pi\u00f9 fertile per una donna, le secrezioni del muco prodotto dalla cervice cambiano. In particolare aumentano appena prima, apparendo pi\u00f9 sottili e scivolose, spiegano i ginecologi, e diminuiscono subito dopo, cambiando di nuovo consistenza. Quando si osservano questi cambiamenti, in prossimit\u00e0 dell\u2019ovulazione, meglio astenersi dai rapporti se non si \u00e8 in cerca di un bambino. Nella versione delmetodo dei due giorni si considera la fertilit\u00e0 minore, e dunque la possibilit\u00e0 di rimanere incinta pi\u00f9 bassa, dopo due giorni di assenza di muco. Quanto funziona? Fino al 96% in modo correttissimo, 88% di media.</p> \n <p>Il metodo della temperatura basale<br> L\u2019idea di base \u00e8 che la temperatura basale della donna \u2013 quella a riposo \u2013 cambi un pochino durante l\u2019ovulazione, innalzandosi leggermente: da 0,2\u00b0C a 0,5\u00b0C. I giorni pi\u00f9 fertili sono quelli a cavallo di questo aumento delle temperature, e l\u2019aumento per due-tre giorni segnala che l\u2019ovulazione \u00e8 avvenuta. L\u2019inserimento di questo dato all\u2019interno di un cervello elettronico che tenga in considerazione altri fattori, quali sopravvivenza dello sperma e possibili irregolarit\u00e0 nel ciclo, come quello alla base di Natural Cycles appunto, permette di identificare i giorni pi\u00f9 o meno fertili, e pi\u00f9 meno dunque a rischio di gravidanza. Anche se Natural Cycles permette di <a href=\"http://ask.naturalcycles.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1969947\">integrare</a> le previsioni con test ormonali su striscette. Integrazioni simili, per il monitoraggio pi\u00f9 o meno diretto dei livelli ormonali, su secrezioni come muco e saliva, dell\u2019ovulazione, sono presenti anche per altre app che monitorano la fertilit\u00e0 (e in questo caso percentuali di efficacia andrebbero calcolate forse caso per caso e in confronto con altri metodi).

        "text": "You wouldn't think that a restaurant that had only been open one month would be heaving to the rafters on a Thursday evening. But that was exactly the scene at The Corner House in Canterbury in August 2016 when we sent our What's On Reporter Lauren MacDougall to check it out. The Corner House on Dover Street officially opened to diners on July 1, 2016, with a fascinating interior sympathetically restored to provide relaxed and characterful surroundings. Head chef, Matt Sworder already owns a successful restaurant in Minster, Thanet which is listed in both the Good Food and Michelin Guides as well as holding the prestigious accolade of Taste of Kent Best Restaurant 2015 and 2017 And now, a year and a half on, the city centre restaurant is following in the footsteps of its award winning sibling, nominated for 2018 Taste of Kent Restaurant of the Year. Sworder also previously worked as a chef in one of Gordon Ramsey's top restaurants, so expectations when we visited, needless to say, were high. And they did not disappoint: the food was virtually flawless, with not a single detail missed, the staff were vibrant, friendly and knowledgeable and the atmosphere was cosy, quaint yet exciting. The much anticipated restaurant serves the very best of what Kent has to offer - from Romney Marsh Lamb to locally caught seafood, from Kent Coffee to homemade 'secret recipe' ice cream. Naturally then, in keeping with the ethos of the restaurant that sharing is in fact caring, I opted for all of the sharing options on the menu. The sharing starter consisted of pork scratchings like I have never experienced before, dipped in a light and fruity apple sauce, thin slices of sausage roll, a moreish chicken liver parfait and a homemade terrine, all served on a wooden sharing board for two. It sounds like an absolute mouthful, but rest assured, the portion sizes were spot on, definitely leaving enough room to tackle the meaty main. Throughout the summer months, diners are offered a BBQ sharing platter, consisting of flat iron steak, chicken thigh kebabs and braised pork ribs served with triple cooked chips, super salad and an innovative range of homemade sauces. And this was the second sharing option I selected from the carefully thought out menu. The ribs were wonderful and meaty, nothing like the stingy variety you'd chomp on at a late night Chinese takeaway, the steak was cooked to medium rare perfection and sliced finely into easy to manage slices. The chicken was tender and the chips were also cooked well - not once, not twice, but three times. The stars of the show though were the little selection of homemade sauces offered with the platter, serving to pull the meaty components together with their unique flavour combinations. On offer was a barbecue mayonnaise, a mushroom ketchup and a classic ketchup, all presented in adorable little kilner jars. My only complaint would be that the jars were just too small - I was literally scraping the barrel to get the most of these little treats. The dessert, yes you guessed it a sharing one too, was a selection of little delights - chocolate brownie with brown bread ice cream, lemon posset, gypsy tart and a little jar of honeycomb ice cream. Again, here it's the homemade elements that really take centre stage. I had never heard of brown bread ice cream until dining at The Corner House, and this secret family recipe with its quirky crunchy texture was absolutely to die for. As well as fantastic local food, cooked to perfection, customers can also enjoy an award-winning range of local beers from Gadds' The Ramsgate Brewery and wines from The Chapel Down Winery in Tenterden at the restaurant. The menu even offers suggestions for the perfect drink to wash down their delightful food. In short, the restaurant is definitely one to add to the food bucket list and could certainly end up on a few prestigious foodie lists of its own if my experience was anything to go by. The Corner House is open Tuesday to Friday, 12pm - 2.30pm and 5.30pm - 9.30pm, Saturday, 12pm - 9.30pm and Sunday, 12pm - 3.30pm.",

It\u2019s a great place for a marketer to convey a message to a specific audience but at the same time, in order for that message to be effective, it needs to be paired with great visuals too.</p> \n <p>Social media marketers are always searching for the better and more effective ways to send their messages. For Instagram, however, in order to be successful, you need to focus primarily on the <a href=\"https://maximizesocialbusiness.com/create-perfect-visual-content-instagram-22953/\">quality of the visual content</a>. For this, you need the best tools and of course, the best resources you can find.</p> \n <p>Let us help you in this quest and ease all your research efforts. Today, we are going to learn together about some of the best design tools and resources you can use as a social media marketer if your campaigns include <a href=\"https://maximizesocialbusiness.com/how-to-grow-website-leads-with-instagram-26713/\">Instagram as a delivery channel</a>.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Yeah, I know, Photoshop is a bit old school for the young generations of social media marketers. Still, when it comes to design and photo manipulation, Adobe\u2019s professional software is still the best in the industry. You need experience and trained skills in order to master this tool professionally but in time, anything is possible.</p> \n <p>On the other hand, you don\u2019t even need to be a Photoshop master in order to be able to create great visual with it. And, since there are still many companies who are paying a subscription to Adobe, it\u2019s good to know how to handle it for day-to-day tasks. It\u2019s a good chance that you will have access to Photoshop if you work at a marketing agency. Or, that you will be asked to work with it from time to time.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>When you think about professionally designed banner ads, you think Bannersnack. It\u2019s a great online tool for designing Instagram sponsored ads and Instagram Stories ads with a huge database of templates and stock images you can choose from. It allows you to design a banner from scratch or, get inspired by their collection of templates and work in a really professional and easy to learn environment.</p> \n <p>What\u2019s really great about Bannersnack is that it has built-in presets for social media banner designs that are compatible with all recommendations. You can design an Instagram banner ad in just a few minutes or a full set of banners for all your social media accounts in the same amount of time. Last but not least, Bannersnack allows you to create static and animated banners from the same interface which can be saved in various file formats, including Html5.</p> \n <p>With your Bannersnack subscription, you get access also to analytics data that will help you track your banners in real time. This means that you can analyze your results and adapt to your audience with minimal efforts.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Do you already have some great photos stored on your phone? Want to publish them on Instagram but you are searching for a simple and yet effective tool to add some text and convey a message along with your great visuals?</p> \n <p>The easiest to use and at the same time, the most effective tool, in this case, may as well be InstaQuote. As the name suggests, the app allows you to create quotes you can share with your Instagram followers in just a few seconds. The only downside is that it is available only for iOS and not for Android. Therefore, you can use it as long as you have an iPhone, iPad or an iPod Touch. As an alternative that is available for both the major mobile operating systems, I suggest you use <a href=\"http://wordswag.co/\">Word Swag</a>.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>The Infographic is one of the greatest inventions of the last decade. It represents a great way to convey a message visually, especially when you want to transmit something more than a simple call to action or quote. The Infographic allows you to transform an entire article into just a single image.</p> \n <p>Ease.ly is the perfect tool to create Infographics the easy way. In no time, you can have one ready to be published and shared with an online audience. You don\u2019t even need to have professional designing skills.</p> \n <p>You can get started with a pre-built template or, you can start designing your Infographic from scratch. What\u2019s great about this tool is that it comes with an impressive number of shapes, objects, and icons that you can drag and drop into the editor, making all your work effortless and at the same time, enjoyable.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Let\u2019s say you have some great photos stored on your drive and you don\u2019t know exactly how they will fit into an Instagram post. Or, you already know they are too large and you want them resized and cropped to fit Instagram\u2019s requirements. I know, you can do this with a professional photo editor but you can also do it in just a few seconds, online, with minimal efforts.</p> \n <p>The tool I am referring to is Social Image Resizer, a basic and easy to use online tool that does exactly what the name suggests: it allows you to resize and crop your images and make them compatible with social media. In this case, we are going to use it for Instagram, of course.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>There are several tools you can use in order to optimize your images for online upload. Instagram is based on visual content and therefore, you need your images to be optimized without a significant loss in quality.</p> \n <p>Image Optimizer is a simple and easy to use online tool that does exactly what you need. It takes your image, allows you to set some parameters and then it optimizes it for Instagram or other social media channels you might want to post on. Moreover, it can be used offline as well, via a free dedicated app available on the same website for download.</p> \n <p>You don\u2019t need to be a visual artist in order to create stunning visuals for your Instagram account. In fact, all you need is a great tool to work with and some imagination.</p> \n <p>If inspiration comes to you as well, then, nothing can stop you.</p> \n <p>What about the tool? Well, here\u2019s another great recommendation for Instagram fans. Its name is Stencil and rest assured, it can make your work easier and more effective. It has a great database of stock images, icons and templates to choose from, an easy to use interface and many more. You can add texts, effects, filters and logos/watermarks to your projects. All your works are saved on your account but you can download them for social media upload as well.</p> \n <p>Stencil is free for the casual user, allowing up to ten visual designs per month without charge. There are two other commercial plans available as well, at $9 and $12 per month, depending on your personal needs.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>While Unsplash is not a designer tool, it\u2019s a great resource for free stock images any designer needs in his or her daily work. All the images are of high quality and they\u2019re released under \u201ccreative commons\u201d (CC0). This means that you can use them however you want, whenever you want. They have no commercial copyrights.</p> \n <p>You can use Unsplash as a source of inspiration as well. Go to their website and start browsing. You\u2019ll be amazed at how many new and great ideas you\u2019ll get just by doing it.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>Another great mobile app that will help you come up with out of the box ideas and unique images for Instagram is Slow Shutter Cam. As the name suggests, this app will allow you to slow the speed of the mobile camera\u2019s shutter. As a result, you will get long exposure photographs with amazing motion blurs and light trail effects.</p> \n <p>Slow Shutter Cam is available for iOS mobile devices such as iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch.</p> \n <p></p> \n <p>I am going to conclude this list with one of my favorite mobile Instagram related apps. It allows you to create beautiful posts with images and texts and it has a great selection of typographies.</p> \n <p>Fonts are very important when it comes to sending a message. Also, for a professional and balanced look on your post, you need a great combination of words and images. All these things are possible with Over. Apart from the regular Instagram posts, you can use the app for <a href=\"https://maximizesocialbusiness.com/instagram-stories-social-influencers-23980/\">Instagram Stories</a>, flyers, social media covers, posters and birthday cards.</p> \n <p>The app is available for iOS but an Android version is in development and it\u2019s soon to be released.</p> \n <p>There are a lot of tools a <a href=\"https://robertkatai.com/the-3-skills-a-social-media-marketer-should-have-in-2017/\">social media marketer</a> needs in order to be able to create the <a href=\"https://maximizesocialbusiness.com/use-instagram-stories-propel-brand-25554/\">best possible Instagram content</a>. Since the success rate of a marketing campaign depends mostly on what you post and how able are you to engage the audience with your content, the tools you use matter a lot.</p> \n <p>I hope you will find everything you need on my list and that these apps will help you make your work easier, more enjoyable and more effective as well.</p> \n <p>What do you think about these apps? Do you have any other apps you might want to add to this list?</p> \n <p></p> \n</div>",

Social media marketers are always searching for the better and more effective ways to send their messages. For Instagram, however, in order to be successful, you need to focus primarily on the quality of the visual content. For this, you need the best tools and of course, the best resources you can find. Let us help you in this quest and ease all your research efforts. Today, we are going to learn together about some of the best design tools and resources you can use as a social media marketer if your campaigns include Instagram as a delivery channel. Yeah, I know, Photoshop is a bit old school for the young generations of social media marketers. Still, when it comes to design and photo manipulation, Adobe\u2019s professional software is still the best in the industry. You need experience and trained skills in order to master this tool professionally but in time, anything is possible. On the other hand, you don\u2019t even need to be a Photoshop master in order to be able to create great visual with it. And, since there are still many companies who are paying a subscription to Adobe, it\u2019s good to know how to handle it for day-to-day tasks. It\u2019s a good chance that you will have access to Photoshop if you work at a marketing agency. Or, that you will be asked to work with it from time to time. When you think about professionally designed banner ads, you think Bannersnack. It\u2019s a great online tool for designing Instagram sponsored ads and Instagram Stories ads with a huge database of templates and stock images you can choose from. It allows you to design a banner from scratch or, get inspired by their collection of templates and work in a really professional and easy to learn environment. What\u2019s really great about Bannersnack is that it has built-in presets for social media banner designs that are compatible with all recommendations. You can design an Instagram banner ad in just a few minutes or a full set of banners for all your social media accounts in the same amount of time. Last but not least, Bannersnack allows you to create static and animated banners from the same interface which can be saved in various file formats, including Html5. With your Bannersnack subscription, you get access also to analytics data that will help you track your banners in real time. This means that you can analyze your results and adapt to your audience with minimal efforts. Do you already have some great photos stored on your phone? Want to publish them on Instagram but you are searching for a simple and yet effective tool to add some text and convey a message along with your great visuals? The easiest to use and at the same time, the most effective tool, in this case, may as well be InstaQuote. As the name suggests, the app allows you to create quotes you can share with your Instagram followers in just a few seconds. The only downside is that it is available only for iOS and not for Android. Therefore, you can use it as long as you have an iPhone, iPad or an iPod Touch. As an alternative that is available for both the major mobile operating systems, I suggest you use Word Swag. The Infographic is one of the greatest inventions of the last decade. It represents a great way to convey a message visually, especially when you want to transmit something more than a simple call to action or quote. The Infographic allows you to transform an entire article into just a single image. Ease.ly is the perfect tool to create Infographics the easy way. In no time, you can have one ready to be published and shared with an online audience. You don\u2019t even need to have professional designing skills. You can get started with a pre-built template or, you can start designing your Infographic from scratch. What\u2019s great about this tool is that it comes with an impressive number of shapes, objects, and icons that you can drag and drop into the editor, making all your work effortless and at the same time, enjoyable. Let\u2019s say you have some great photos stored on your drive and you don\u2019t know exactly how they will fit into an Instagram post. Or, you already know they are too large and you want them resized and cropped to fit Instagram\u2019s requirements. I know, you can do this with a professional photo editor but you can also do it in just a few seconds, online, with minimal efforts. The tool I am referring to is Social Image Resizer, a basic and easy to use online tool that does exactly what the name suggests: it allows you to resize and crop your images and make them compatible with social media. In this case, we are going to use it for Instagram, of course. There are several tools you can use in order to optimize your images for online upload. Instagram is based on visual content and therefore, you need your images to be optimized without a significant loss in quality. Image Optimizer is a simple and easy to use online tool that does exactly what you need. It takes your image, allows you to set some parameters and then it optimizes it for Instagram or other social media channels you might want to post on. Moreover, it can be used offline as well, via a free dedicated app available on the same website for download. You don\u2019t need to be a visual artist in order to create stunning visuals for your Instagram account. In fact, all you need is a great tool to work with and some imagination. If inspiration comes to you as well, then, nothing can stop you. What about the tool? Well, here\u2019s another great recommendation for Instagram fans. Its name is Stencil and rest assured, it can make your work easier and more effective. It has a great database of stock images, icons and templates to choose from, an easy to use interface and many more. You can add texts, effects, filters and logos/watermarks to your projects. All your works are saved on your account but you can download them for social media upload as well. Stencil is free for the casual user, allowing up to ten visual designs per month without charge. There are two other commercial plans available as well, at $9 and $12 per month, depending on your personal needs. While Unsplash is not a designer tool, it\u2019s a great resource for free stock images any designer needs in his or her daily work. All the images are of high quality and they\u2019re released under \u201ccreative commons\u201d (CC0). This means that you can use them however you want, whenever you want. They have no commercial copyrights. You can use Unsplash as a source of inspiration as well. Go to their website and start browsing. You\u2019ll be amazed at how many new and great ideas you\u2019ll get just by doing it. Another great mobile app that will help you come up with out of the box ideas and unique images for Instagram is Slow Shutter Cam. As the name suggests, this app will allow you to slow the speed of the mobile camera\u2019s shutter. As a result, you will get long exposure photographs with amazing motion blurs and light trail effects. Slow Shutter Cam is available for iOS mobile devices such as iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. I am going to conclude this list with one of my favorite mobile Instagram related apps. It allows you to create beautiful posts with images and texts and it has a great selection of typographies. Fonts are very important when it comes to sending a message. Also, for a professional and balanced look on your post, you need a great combination of words and images. All these things are possible with Over. Apart from the regular Instagram posts, you can use the app for Instagram Stories, flyers, social media covers, posters and birthday cards. The app is available for iOS but an Android version is in development and it\u2019s soon to be released. There are a lot of tools a social media marketer needs in order to be able to create the best possible Instagram content. Since the success rate of a marketing campaign depends mostly on what you post and how able are you to engage the audience with your content, the tools you use matter a lot. I hope you will find everything you need on my list and that these apps will help you make your work easier, more enjoyable and more effective as well. What do you think about these apps? Do you have any other apps you might want to add to this list?",

        "structuredText": "<p>Elizabeth Greenwood | Longreads | January 2018 | 25 minutes (6,900 words)</p> \n<p>Another fit of insomnia. I reach for a book I\u2019ve read before, in times both happy and sad: Sharon Salzberg\u2019s Lovingkindness. I open at random to a chapter toward the end, on the subject of generosity. \u201cWhen a strong urge comes up in my mind to give something \u2014 even though the next fifty thoughts may be \u2018Oh, no, I can\u2019t do that. I might need it!\u2019\u2014 I give it,\u201d Salzberg writes. \u201cEven if fear or other considerations come up, my resolve is to honor that first impulse to give.\u201d As I read these lines, my heart seizes. Something in this passage contained the remedy I\u2019d been craving because everything in my life felt as if it was contracting.</p> \n<p>My first book was hot off the presses. I\u2019d heard about the cruel process from other authors: You expect your life to change dramatically. This will not happen. There will be a short-lived flurry of attention and things will go back to normal. I steeled myself, but a part of me thought maybe they are wrong. Maybe my life will change!</p> \n<p>Dear reader, I am here to tell you there was no such reversal of fortune. I\u2019d spent the past six years researching people who had faked their deaths and I was back to the drawing board. Typically, I would have been teaching several writing classes, but due to the vicissitudes of the adjunct professor labor market I was underemployed, anxious, and blue.</p> \n<p>I got a prescription for Klonopin and I started getting acupuncture, which left me weeping on the table for thirty minutes while the poker and her interns assured me this outsized reaction to tiny pinpricks was totally normal. I\u2019d have loved to have indulged in some old-fashioned talk therapy, but my disaster health insurance didn\u2019t cover it. I even tried equine therapy, which I wrote about for a travel magazine, and spent the afternoon corralling two miniature horses in order to learn to trust myself.</p> \n<p>I was still questioning whether the choices I\u2019d made over the past few years were worth it if all I had to show for it felt like a big nothing. The luxury of complaining about any of this \u2014 I\u2019m a childless, educated woman in America \u2014 made it feel all the more shameful. So the cycle compounded. Something needed to change.</p> \n<p>Then the election happened. In a confluence of a precipitous adrenalin crash, a gaping daily schedule, limited finances, and a political climate that had everyone adjusting their meds, I was crying almost every day at the pointlessness of it all. My sleepless nights stretched into twos and threes. I wanted to figure out the way I was going to help but had no clue as to how.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s when insomnia propelled me to open randomly to Salzberg\u2019s lines about generosity. Something in this challenge to give blindly, to listen to the part of oneself that blithely seeks to contribute, instead of the cacophony of voices concerned with balancing the checkbook. Expanding beyond one\u2019s postage-stamp reality seemed like it could be the antidote to the feelings of scarcity propelling my anxiety.</p> \n<p>We all want to give, at least in theory. But when presented the opportunity, we come up with excuses as to why the time is not ripe. We imagine we\u2019ll donate to charities when we are more financially secure. We consider getting up from our subway seat for the weary-looking woman, then demur. As if extending beyond ourselves even slightly will make our precarious balance of time, energy, and emotional resources come crashing down.</p> \n<p>So I made a resolution \u2014 for the first month of 2017 I would give everything. The rules were simple: If I got the urge to be generous, I\u2019d try to honor it. I would try to do this in every category of giving I could imagine \u2014 in time, in money, in undivided attention, in suspending judgment, in forgiveness, in giving people the benefit of a doubt. I\u2019d volunteer, drop dollars in the most dubious panhandlers\u2019 cups, I\u2019d pick up the tab. I\u2019d try to take generous interpretations of others\u2019 baffling behavior, as I take most everything personally. I\u2019d dispense unsolicited praise. For years I\u2019d resisted the urge to invade other New Yorkers\u2019 privacy. No more! I would compliment freely, and they could put my name on a registry if they wished. My great hope for this experiment was to plug back into my life and to brandish a big middle finger to a regime intent on making us feel separate from one another.</p> \n<p>Then, just before Christmas, my dog decided to treat herself to a Ziploc of trail mix from my purse. The concoction contained raisins, which are lethal to canines. One $1500 vet bill later I was feeling exceptionally broke. This was the exact moment when excuses are made, when we chicken out. But I\u2019d already committed to my experiment. With utter terror in my heart, I stepped off the ledge. It was time to give dangerously.</p> \n<p>I wake up in Oakland, having spent a few days with my best friend from college who is tremendously pregnant. Our daily routine consists of binge-watching shows, doing a light activity, and then returning home to rest. I\u2019ve been giving Zo\u00eb shoulder rubs all week and paying for whatever she\u2019ll let me \u2014 ice cream, gas, Mexican takeout.</p> \n<p>What isn\u2019t as easy is lunch with Krista, a longtime family friend, something of a cousin to me. We have a strained relationship and have little in common, but get together when I\u2019m out west due to a misplaced sense of obligation. We were raised high WASP, and the conversation glides along the surface of things like a figure skater. Resentment? What resentment! Isn\u2019t this cheese divine? We meet at a loud, overpriced restaurant in the Ferry Building. We discuss her kids, her \u201cpersonal brand,\u201d and Marin County real estate, all of which she has achieved. She takes a tone with the busboy when our food takes over half an hour to arrive. When the bill comes, I pick it up, much to her surprise and mine. The total comes to just over a hundred dollars because I tip extra.</p> \n<p>I get back on BART in a disassociated state as I often do after spending any amount of time with Krista. Zo\u00eb picks me up, and we repair to an outdoor mall, my favorite California institution, and I spend over $200 dollars on various serums and unguents at Sephora. This doesn\u2019t feel like self-care or generosity. This feels like mania.</p> \n<p>Back in New York I have ten dollars out for the cabbie on the way home from JFK and put two back in my wallet. Shameful. I go to a crowded resolutions-fresh yoga class. I typically set up in the front row, not because I am good at yoga but because I want as few toned yoga bodies in my line of sight as possible. A Lululemon doyenne with the triceps to show for it takes her place to my right, and I wedge into the front corner with the wall to my left. Perfect, I think. Just one other human in my peripheral vision, the rest of the class a jam-packed sweaty moving organism of good intentions. I will really kick this year off right.</p> \n<p>Once the sun salutations begin, my neighbor flings her arms out to the side to Namaste the morning. She makes strong contact with me and gives not a nod of apology or acknowledgment. Oh well, I think. Round two, smacks me again! Every New Yorker knows well and good that in a crowded yoga studio you throw your arms up, not out. Round three, full on bopped this time! My heart starts pounding. She\u2019s interrupting my flow with zero regard! After exchanging sweat with this precious soul several more times, and audibly sighing with each brush of her manicured hand, I decide: Fuck it.</p> \n<p>I will extend generosity to her by allowing her to hit me. I will offer my body to her as a battering ram for full sun salutation. This requires much deep breathing on my part in lieu of biting her, but I am shifting my mind toward expansive acceptance rather than anger at a person oblivious to my moral outrage. I still want to bite her.</p> \n<p>I go to work on my laptop at a coffee shop near my house. I usually tip my beloved baristas $1 \u2014 and only about half the time, depending on my feelings of poverty that day. I will do this only if the coffee slinger sees me, in the sad hope that maybe she\u2019ll give me an extra shot of espresso for free. But not today! I slip two dollars into the jar while the woman working the counter grabs my drink. She doesn\u2019t even see me do it. I am basically Mother Teresa.</p> \n<p>The super in my building is a lanky fellow named Junior. He runs a small racket out of the recycling in the basement, distributing cans and bottles to neighborhood vagrants who line up around 10 a.m. every other day, for which I imagine Junior is taking a cut. Since I work from home and walk the dog around this time, I have a front row seat to the cottage industry. Junior will often stop me to kvetch about the weather for a while, then ask me \u201cto hold ten dollars\u201d so he can buy cigarettes. I rarely carry cash as part of an ill-advised ploy to spend less. I instead offer cigarettes from my own aging stash. He refuses, preferring Kools. Today we go through the same rigmarole, and in my wallet, I have a twenty, not a ten. \u201cHere, take this,\u201d I say, my hand quivering in giving over an Andrew Jackson. Junior is pumped and promises to get me back in the next few days. I never see the money again.</p> \n<p>If I claimed this was an act of selfless generosity, I\u2019d be lying. Junior lives in the apartment above me and often cares for his toddler granddaughter, whose bedtime is around 1 am. Junior seems to be prepping for his Riverdance audition both day and night. It is not infrequent that I will stomp upstairs after midnight in my housecoat asking in my white girl voice to \u201cPlease be mindful, as I am trying to get some sleep.\u201d I\u2019m hoping the crisp $20 will buy me some quiet. It does not.</p> \n<p>I\u2019ve been meditating for a few years now, and not because I am virtuous. I have to meditate for 15 minutes each day in order to not get arrested. I bust out my meditation technique prior to nerve-wracking situations, like giving a talk. I\u2019ll begin to summon the feeling I\u2019d like to exude, sit on a few couch cushions, take some deep breaths and visualize myself fielding questions and criticisms with a smile and \u00e9lan.</p> \n<p>I\u2019ve been trying the same strategy in the morning for the past week or so to psyche myself up to be generous. I close my eyes, picture an exhausted mother with bratty children entering the subway and see myself magnanimously, selflessly, standing up for her. Other passengers notice my benevolence, maybe even rousing inspiration. I see myself standing aside in line, letting some harried citizen to cut me. The bill comes after a big dinner with friends, and I quietly pick it up. The waitress even writes a small note on the receipt: If only there were more people like you.</p> \n<p>But today it isn\u2019t working. Seeing the slideshow of generous events only makes me feel stricken with anxiety, more aware of my limitations.</p> \n<p>So I try something different. I instead conjure the feeling of having enough, visualizing what that would look like. I see myself engaged in each moment of my life \u2014 the tedious answering of emails, listening to my boyfriend instead of unloading on him, responding to prison letters for my new book project with the utmost care. My bank account doesn\u2019t contain a certain target number, but I engage a feeling of peace toward it. I try to sit in the sensation of having enough, feeling generosity move through me. I am the conduit \u2014 the thing I am giving away was never mine in the first place.My chest begins to swell and my limbs experience a pleasant, groggy glow. I feel rooted to the ground in a way that doesn\u2019t seem ponderous. I feel bolstered instead of weighed down.</p> \n<p>Rather than picturing myself giving, I reverse engineer the feeling of abundance to make that the baseline for the day. I manage to:</p> \n<p>I felt a little surge, a little electrical current of belonging, each time. Belonging to what? I\u2019m not quite sure, but it was something bigger than my own plight.</p> \n<p>There\u2019s a homeless woman who sits in front of the falafel place near my boyfriend\u2019s apartment. I can understand the words she says individually, but collectively they make no sense. She has a kindly way about her, so I call her Eunice.</p> \n<p>Today I pack up a sack of food to give her on my way to the gym \u2014 clementines, granola bars, bananas, trail mix \u2014 a cornucopia of organic Brooklyn fare. I hand it to her, and she is gracious. I see her carefully stuff it into the innards of several bags nestled inside one another like skins. She smiles, I smile back. She thanks me, and I say \u201cyou\u2019re welcome.\u201d It\u2019s all so easy. I could do this every day. I am a motherfucking saint.</p> \n<p>On my way back to Scott\u2019s building, I see his neighbor. She\u2019s wheeling a little grocery cart, closes in on Eunice, and\u2026she\u2019s giving it to her! Goddamn her! Here\u2019s something Eunice can actually use! I was supposed to be the good person today, and here she goes, showing me up.</p> \n<p>Perhaps I still have a few dark and petty corners where the light of generosity could give a good scrub.</p> \n<p>I have volunteered to subject myself to something called MulchFest.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s Sunday. I\u2019m hungover, it\u2019s freezing, and Scott is sprawled out on the couch with coffee and The New York Times. I sit with him and debate the relative merits of submitting myself to the elements, and to the perky knowingness of the Park Slope canvas bag-toting crowd. Scott is from the Midwest and believes that life should be difficult. I put on two pairs of socks and my heaviest coat and head out.</p> \n<p>I\u2019m several hours late and somebody in a neon pinafore hands me a clicker counter to tick off the trees as they get mulched. I have the overwhelming urge to punch my thumb down, to feel the satisfying click click click but know this will irretrievably fuck up the count. So I stand at attention, desperately resisting the urge to pull out my phone and appear occupied. The point of MulchFest, I have decided, is to commune with my surroundings, my neighbors, to behold the circle of life as manifested by browning pine needles, the melancholy stench of decomposition signaling the promise of a new year. A fellow who looks to me like a human hacky sack sees me with my brow furrowed and waiting to count trees that never arrive. Everyone is still at lunch, he informs me. I return the clicker and he gently ushers me over to a little white tent and presents me with a new task: creating pine sachets from freshly mulched trees to distribute to park patrons.</p> \n<p>The rhythm of dipping a trowel into the needles and tying off the bag is lulling, relaxing. I merchandise my wares attractively on a card table. Park goers stop by and ask, \u201cMay I take one?\u201d \u201cTake TWO!\u201d I implore, \u201cand a snack!\u201d chucking an apple and a granola bar at them. I am giving people something they want, for free, something crafted by these two hands. I\u2019m loving this. An hour and a half passes and it feels like but a moment. I\u2019m in love with Brooklyn, with humanity.</p> \n<p>I once dated a journalist who never stopped giving \u2014 to strangers, to the less fortunate, to people he was writing about, mostly. Every Sunday morning, Rob would throw back the comforter and go to prepare lunch for homeless people in a church basement. He became close with one of the regulars, helping him advocate to get his VA benefits reinstated, putting his name on housing lottery lists, taking him to doctor\u2019s appointments for his chronic pain. Rob was widely regarded as someone who would interrupt his life for the benefit of others, one of the most generous people anyone had ever known. But I could never get him to open up to me, not in any deepening intimacy. A frustrating part of our relationship was how his service made him somehow unimpeachable.</p> \n<p>To whom are we generous, and why? For Rob, caring for strangers came second nature. For me, not so much. Looking back, I think Rob threw himself into others because he was a little scared of his own life, and of people getting close. Giving, for him, was, in part, a way to hide. This is an ungenerous interpretation, I realize \u2014 but on which side of the ledger does our giving fall? And who is keeping score?</p> \n<p>The worst words a New Yorker can hear on the subway: What time is it? SHOWTIME! Out-of-town visitors film the acrobatics with glee while I contract further into myself. I give a dollar to Showtime, which I loathe. But giving the dollar somehow makes me loathe them less.</p> \n<p>I am still meditating in my new style, conjuring a sense of abundance. The phrase that came to me today was \u201cless afraid.\u201d In that tiny moment in the morning, I certainly feel a wash of quiet confidence. Getting up off my meditation cushion, well, that\u2019s a different story.</p> \n<p>I understand my little experiment is made possible by the fact of my privileges: I enjoy a degree of freedom and mobility unknown any time in previous human history. I am in charge of keeping alive no one but myself and a 15-pound dog. My career choices may not pay in money, but I am wealthy in time, flexibility, and multiple breakfasts. I\u2019m healthy and able-bodied. Perhaps my generosity experiment is a foray into a kind of first-world problem, manufacturing a false sense of adversity. What would, say, a single mom think of my enterprise? I ask the best one I know: my own.</p> \n<p>I give her a call and explain the project. \u201cWhat would you have said to somebody embarking on such a journey back when my sister and I were younger?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWell, I can tell you what I would\u2019ve thought,\u201d she says laughing with the irreverence that is my genetic inheritance. \u201cMy whole life is about being generous to my children. I use up my finite supply of generosity in keeping the household together.\u201d It\u2019s true. I remember her falling asleep on the couch by 9 p.m. every night of my childhood.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut generosity can also be about receiving, allowing others to be generous to you,\u201d I counter.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen I was raising you guys, I had to convince myself of my own strength. I had to get into the mindset that I was capable of doing this on my own. If the spark plug went out on the lawnmower, then I needed to know how to fix it myself.\u201d</p> \n<p>Then she tells me something I didn\u2019t know: \u201cI also felt so alone, and I didn\u2019t want to depend on anyone else. And then you start to build up walls, and even a martyr complex, like, \u2018I\u2019m the good responsible one, I have to be sensible.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cIt does seem we expect more automatic generosity from women, and are then delightfully surprised when men go beyond themselves, huh?\u201d I say.</p> \n<p>\u201cHell, yes! Women are always putting other people first. All our energy goes into other people. Think about Grammy, her life was cut short because of it,\u201d my mom says breathlessly. My grandmother had three kids, a paraplegic husband, a rural mail route as a postal worker, her elderly parents across the street, a dozen grandchildren, and innumerable wayward souls she cared for. She literally worked herself to death.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you could go back in time, what generosity would you have offered yourself?\u201d I ask.</p> \n<p>\u201cI would\u2019ve just allowed myself to take more time for me, I suppose. I could\u2019ve hired a babysitter for the night, but that seemed unthinkable. Same too with little splurges, like a facial or a massage. Those lines just seemed so clear to me then, and I couldn\u2019t cross them. It\u2019s not selfish to take care of yourself.\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>One of the greatest generosities I\u2019ve known is when strangers reach out to let me know they\u2019ve enjoyed my book. This means more to me than any review or professional accolade; it buoys me during the rough times and makes my whole day. I think about how many books I\u2019ve devoured and recommended to anyone who will listen \u2014 save the author. So today I send laudatory notes, thanking writers whose work has meant much to me.</p> \n<p>When you truly love something, there is nothing easier or more natural in the world than to say so. I write my friend Amitava, letting him know I will teach his essay about performing Hindu burial rites for his mother, and how moving I found his recollection. I send an earnest letter of gratitude to a beloved actress thanking her for a recent personal essay she wrote about her relationship with reviews, and how it made me feel less alone. I write an Irish fellow about how much I enjoyed an excerpt of his book. Though it feels a bit awkward to telegraph admiration to total strangers, the feeling of lift far outweighs the embarrassment. It feels like an unburdening.</p> \n<p>Generosity, thus far, has proved illuminating when giving comes easily \u2014 giving compliments, sending texts to friends trying to brighten their day, in little gestures like getting up to offer a lady in nurse\u2019s scrubs my subway seat.</p> \n<p>But money is where I am stuck. Scarcity is the heart of my fear. Being in deep student loan debt and in precarious employment, my inner monologue is a stream of calculations, always trying to suss out how many more months I can exist in New York. Instead of getting a real handle on my finances, like by following a budget, I adhere to Coinstar, consigning clothes, cooking big batches of chili to eat throughout the week, and prayer.</p> \n<p>So today I decide to give away money. I send $10 to a friend of a friend\u2019s GoFundMe to help replace clothes and furniture lost in a fire. I then notice more calls for help which I skillfully tend to ignore \u2014 $10 to a friend\u2019s sister\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s sister\u2019s fundraiser to get a seeing-eye dog, $10 to my second cousin who wants to record a demo of songs. And because we live in end times I send $10 to the ACLU, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and Planned Parenthood. Then I give a whopping $50 to WNYC because it\u2019s pledge drive time and every little bit helps.That\u2019s $110 in total. Turns out that donating via the internet is pretty much like any kind of online shopping: You end up spending far more than you would if the cold currency were to physically depart from your wallet.</p> \n<p>By evening I receive an email from a former tutoring client about starting sessions with her younger son, and another query about subletting my room. Did parting with my funds send a rupture of wealth through the universe? Did I just manifest money by giving it away? Steeped in the culture of The Secret and living in late capitalism, it\u2019s tough to imagine giving without getting anything back in return. Does this mean my project is sullied?</p> \n<p>I decide to take this line of inquiry to somebody who may know. I meet Richard Bascetta, a senior Buddhist teacher at the Shambhala Center of New York, for coffee. He\u2019s a bit of a silver fox and wears cool square-framed glasses. I explain my project and my query \u2014 how can we give selflessly without expecting anything back? Since this giving thing has been feeling pretty good, is it okay to use generosity as a panacea to feeling bad?</p> \n<p>Richard has lived in New York and practiced Buddhism here for decades, and realizes generosity\u2019s challenges: \u201cIn this environment, we are fighting for space, for money, for status, for a fear of not having that money and status. People come here to accomplish. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a good writer, but there are at least a hundred people here who are as good or better.\u201d Damn, Richard.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur inertia typically prevents us from acting for others,\u201d he says, his eyes never wavering from my gaze. \u201cWe buffer ourselves through our lives. Through parenting, running a business, careers, chasing one love after another, our anger \u2014 whatever buffers us from the rawness of the moment. The more layers we put on like an itchy coat, the more difficult it is to access a sense of generosity. Generosity, in its most powerful form, is breaking through the inertia.\u201d</p> \n<p>Richard tells me that a few years back he started carrying a stack of ones in his front pocket. Each time he\u2019d pass a panhandler or street musician whose tunes he admired, he\u2019d drop a dollar in their cup. But lately, he\u2019s been pulling his hand back. And he\u2019s not sure why. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pinching reminder that I\u2019m compromising my original intention\u2014to give regardless of my inner commentary about the person,\u201d he says. But he doesn\u2019t see this as all bad: \u201cIt\u2019s given me the chance to reflect and see how my judgments get in the way and clog the flow of generosity.\u201d</p> \n<p>Richard assures me this is okay, because the benefit of generosity \u2014 beyond how good it feels, beyond helping someone else \u2014 is that it reveals to us where we are stuck. \u201cWe are working with that resistance. Where does that mistrust and worry reside in you? That\u2019s the investigation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Buddhists believe that one moment of presence is a moment of enlightenment. And when I think back over the past month, I see I\u2019ve built a repository of these moments: connecting with Eunice before I was shown up; becoming hypnotized by the rhythm of filling a cloth bag with pine needles; hearing about a time in my mom\u2019s life that was a struggle. Enlightenment is a distant shore for me but these moments are undeniably fractals of a larger mosaic.</p> \n<p>On Inauguration Day I take a train to Philadelphia to rendezvous with my sister, mom, and aunt, where we will set out for the Women\u2019s March before dawn the next day. I expect to have many opportunities to exercise generosity, what with thousands of strangers vying for catharsis and a bathroom. The last time I saw my sister was over Christmas, when she called me a sausage, referring to the growing weight differential between us. I close my eyes on the train and silently release that hardened gem of hurt. The release is more gestural than actual, a bit of fake-it-till-you-make-it.</p> \n<p>We are on the road and our excitement swells as we pass dozens of charter buses at rest stops and see pink floppy hats all around. But when we go to drop our bags at our hotel, it hits me. The inauguration crowd is still in town. Staying at our Marriott Courtyard just outside the Pentagon are not only protesters of the new regime but supporters as well. I see whole families decked out in matching red hats and commemorative t-shirts. My body seizes up. I actually feel terrified of these people, even though I think the fear is irrational. I\u2019d been envisioning practicing my giving toward allies, my family, people as outraged as me. Now I have to dive deep into the wells of whatever reserves of compassion I\u2019ve been cultivating over the month toward my perceived enemies. How can I engage those from the other side? What will be my part in making things better? I decide today will be about extending generosity to these folks, to people who took off work and spent their hard-earned money to bear witness and lend their enthusiasm to the installation of our new president.</p> \n<p>The march itself is magical, and exhausting, and inspiring. I behold so much generosity around me: There are people passing around bags of trail mix and carrot sticks; people creating a human microphone to reunite a lost child with her mother; there are cops and medics rushing to help the fallen in the crush of humans. But what impresses me most about the day is the new reality we live in. I feel safe and secure in the sea of witty signs and like-minded representatives of the popular vote. But the second we break away and walk along the Mall we pass more Trump supporters. What would my generosity even look like to them? Would it register? Right now the most generous thing I can do is to not push them into traffic on Independence Avenue. But I think about a quote, supposedly from the Dalai Lama: \u201cIf you can, help others; if you cannot do that, at least do not harm them.\u201d</p> \n<p>As we walk back across the bridge toward Arlington Cemetery, where my grandfather, a veteran of World War II and Korea is buried, I lag behind. The day is gray, thick, and unseasonably warm. We are all hungry and cranky, legs achy from standing for hours. In the distance, I see a pack of white boys in red caps walking toward us. My body responds before my brain, sensing a threat. They pass my mom and sister, who are still wearing their pink hats, ahead of me. I took mine off when we left the March because I am an actual pussy, fearful a Trump supporter would hurl an epithet or punch me in the face. When I catch up with them, my mom and sister seem shaken and tired, trying to be stoic.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey called us \u2018clits,\u2019\u201d my mom says, shaking her head.</p> \n<p>Now my limbic system is just confused, outraged that these assholes would dare speak to anyone, let alone two women. But I\u2019m doubly confused because \u201cclit\u201d is perhaps the most bizarre term they could have lobbed. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t know where to locate one on a human female!\u201d I counter. I try to make light of it, but we are all on edge.</p> \n<p>Back at the hotel, the air conditioning is blasting and we devour our burgers. More white people are milling around in stars-and-stripes gear. It occurs to me I have a choice. I can treat all of these people as a monolith of hatred and ignorance, or try to see them as individuals. The results are nothing stunning: I allow a Trump-supporting couple to enter the elevator ahead of me. I move my bag at breakfast the next morning so a teenage girl in a red cap can sit down. I leave a tip for the housekeeper, her political affiliations unknown. I let the same Trump-supporting couple board the airport courtesy van first. It doesn\u2019t matter, we\u2019re all going to the same place anyway.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>The month ends. By my count I\u2019ve given away 19 subway seats, picked up the check at dinner and drinks half a dozen times, sent 36 \u201cI just called to say I love you\u201d texts to friends, sent $320 dollars to different fundraisers and organizations, given $47 to the homeless, and spent 15 hours of my life volunteering. I\u2019ve let Scott\u2019s innocent yet potentially inflammatory comments slide more times than my ego is comfortable with. I bought coffee and a sandwich for my ex without sending a Venmo request for the privilege. I traveled to distant neighborhoods to meet friends for dinner closer to where they live. I\u2019ve left notes in Scott\u2019s pockets for him to discover during the day. I\u2019ve bought bouquets of flowers to bestow upon unsuspecting pals. I\u2019ve done nothing but listen on the phone, seated, taking it in, when usually doing household chores simultaneously. I\u2019ve stayed past my office hours to meet a student who was freaking out about an assignment. I\u2019ve sent e-books to a friend to use while nursing. I\u2019ve been generous to myself by wearing the good underwear at the back of my drawer that I save for a special occasion that never comes. I\u2019ve tried to do only one thing at a time.</p> \n<p>But the experiment doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s over \u2014 I didn\u2019t do this perfectly. There were times when I grabbed a subway seat like manifest destiny. There was a time I decided to get offended by a friend\u2019s offhanded remark. I spent an afternoon at the Brooklyn Food Bank silently cursing the project director, who I took to be an imperious asshole. I noticed I have the hardest time letting things slide from the people closest to me. Like Richard said, examining oneself through the lens of generosity can be illuminating. At the beginning of the month I was listing all my generous acts. But by the end of the month, I was listing opportunities to be generous that I didn\u2019t take up. Those moments taught me more about myself. Instead of feeling defeated by my imperfection, I feel curious, inspired even.</p> \n<p>You make yourself vulnerable by making an offering the other may or may not take. You extend yourself in giving praise, attention, patience. You let the other in. You see the sky does not fall. You do it again. Giving becomes easier. Defensiveness can soften because you\u2019re not fighting to preserve what little you feel you have to protect. From the constant gnaw of scarcity, you realize there is enough.</p> \n<p>I\u2019m still grouchy as hell. But I\u2019ve found giving to be the easiest, quickest, even cheapest way to feel good, better than therapy, equine or otherwise. If I want to reset the chemistry of my brain on a particularly down day, I\u2019ll just try to listen to what someone is telling me. I\u2019ll text friends telling them how much I adore them. I\u2019ll buy coffee for the person behind me in line. And a little bit of the weight lifts.</p> \n<p>When I think back to the first day of my experiment, when I endured and paid for a frustrating lunch with Krista, I see it differently now. The truest generosity I could\u2019ve offered wouldn\u2019t have been in picking up the tab, but in looking directly in her eyes and meeting her where she is, where we all are: imperfect, flawed, all-too-human, locked into our own stories of what is going on, the only story we understand to be true. For all I know, she had to do deep breathing just to be around me.</p> \n<p>I haven\u2019t mastered generosity and the fearlessness that comes with it. But I\u2019ve touched it in moments. I want to experience more of those moments. And because life always gives us a heaping helping of stress and awkward lunches and unexpected vet bills, I know I will have more to do. Because I didn\u2019t die this month, nor did I go into the poorhouse, nor did I feel overextended. Instead, I felt connected. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by how much further I have to go, I feel ready. Instead of feeling stretched thin, I feel full.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Elizabeth Greenwood is the author of<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Playing-Dead-Journey-Through-World-ebook/dp/B0176M3ZP6/ref=sr_1_1?tag=longreads-20\">Playing Dead: A Journey Through the World of Death Fraud</a>, a nonfiction book about people who have faked their deaths.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
        "text": "Elizabeth Greenwood | Longreads | January 2018 | 25 minutes (6,900 words) Another fit of insomnia. I reach for a book I\u2019ve read before, in times both happy and sad: Sharon Salzberg\u2019s Lovingkindness. I open at random to a chapter toward the end, on the subject of generosity. \u201cWhen a strong urge comes up in my mind to give something \u2014 even though the next fifty thoughts may be \u2018Oh, no, I can\u2019t do that. I might need it!\u2019\u2014 I give it,\u201d Salzberg writes. \u201cEven if fear or other considerations come up, my resolve is to honor that first impulse to give.\u201d As I read these lines, my heart seizes. Something in this passage contained the remedy I\u2019d been craving because everything in my life felt as if it was contracting. My first book was hot off the presses. I\u2019d heard about the cruel process from other authors: You expect your life to change dramatically. This will not happen. There will be a short-lived flurry of attention and things will go back to normal. I steeled myself, but a part of me thought maybe they are wrong. Maybe my life will change! Dear reader, I am here to tell you there was no such reversal of fortune. I\u2019d spent the past six years researching people who had faked their deaths and I was back to the drawing board. Typically, I would have been teaching several writing classes, but due to the vicissitudes of the adjunct professor labor market I was underemployed, anxious, and blue. I got a prescription for Klonopin and I started getting acupuncture, which left me weeping on the table for thirty minutes while the poker and her interns assured me this outsized reaction to tiny pinpricks was totally normal. I\u2019d have loved to have indulged in some old-fashioned talk therapy, but my disaster health insurance didn\u2019t cover it. I even tried equine therapy, which I wrote about for a travel magazine, and spent the afternoon corralling two miniature horses in order to learn to trust myself. I was still questioning whether the choices I\u2019d made over the past few years were worth it if all I had to show for it felt like a big nothing. The luxury of complaining about any of this \u2014 I\u2019m a childless, educated woman in America \u2014 made it feel all the more shameful. So the cycle compounded. Something needed to change. Then the election happened. In a confluence of a precipitous adrenalin crash, a gaping daily schedule, limited finances, and a political climate that had everyone adjusting their meds, I was crying almost every day at the pointlessness of it all. My sleepless nights stretched into twos and threes. I wanted to figure out the way I was going to help but had no clue as to how. That\u2019s when insomnia propelled me to open randomly to Salzberg\u2019s lines about generosity. Something in this challenge to give blindly, to listen to the part of oneself that blithely seeks to contribute, instead of the cacophony of voices concerned with balancing the checkbook. Expanding beyond one\u2019s postage-stamp reality seemed like it could be the antidote to the feelings of scarcity propelling my anxiety. We all want to give, at least in theory. But when presented the opportunity, we come up with excuses as to why the time is not ripe. We imagine we\u2019ll donate to charities when we are more financially secure. We consider getting up from our subway seat for the weary-looking woman, then demur. As if extending beyond ourselves even slightly will make our precarious balance of time, energy, and emotional resources come crashing down. So I made a resolution \u2014 for the first month of 2017 I would give everything. The rules were simple: If I got the urge to be generous, I\u2019d try to honor it. I would try to do this in every category of giving I could imagine \u2014 in time, in money, in undivided attention, in suspending judgment, in forgiveness, in giving people the benefit of a doubt. I\u2019d volunteer, drop dollars in the most dubious panhandlers\u2019 cups, I\u2019d pick up the tab. I\u2019d try to take generous interpretations of others\u2019 baffling behavior, as I take most everything personally. I\u2019d dispense unsolicited praise. For years I\u2019d resisted the urge to invade other New Yorkers\u2019 privacy. No more! I would compliment freely, and they could put my name on a registry if they wished. My great hope for this experiment was to plug back into my life and to brandish a big middle finger to a regime intent on making us feel separate from one another. Then, just before Christmas, my dog decided to treat herself to a Ziploc of trail mix from my purse. The concoction contained raisins, which are lethal to canines. One $1500 vet bill later I was feeling exceptionally broke. This was the exact moment when excuses are made, when we chicken out. But I\u2019d already committed to my experiment. With utter terror in my heart, I stepped off the ledge. It was time to give dangerously. I wake up in Oakland, having spent a few days with my best friend from college who is tremendously pregnant. Our daily routine consists of binge-watching shows, doing a light activity, and then returning home to rest. I\u2019ve been giving Zo\u00eb shoulder rubs all week and paying for whatever she\u2019ll let me \u2014 ice cream, gas, Mexican takeout. What isn\u2019t as easy is lunch with Krista, a longtime family friend, something of a cousin to me. We have a strained relationship and have little in common, but get together when I\u2019m out west due to a misplaced sense of obligation. We were raised high WASP, and the conversation glides along the surface of things like a figure skater. Resentment? What resentment! Isn\u2019t this cheese divine? We meet at a loud, overpriced restaurant in the Ferry Building. We discuss her kids, her \u201cpersonal brand,\u201d and Marin County real estate, all of which she has achieved. She takes a tone with the busboy when our food takes over half an hour to arrive. When the bill comes, I pick it up, much to her surprise and mine. The total comes to just over a hundred dollars because I tip extra. I get back on BART in a disassociated state as I often do after spending any amount of time with Krista. Zo\u00eb picks me up, and we repair to an outdoor mall, my favorite California institution, and I spend over $200 dollars on various serums and unguents at Sephora. This doesn\u2019t feel like self-care or generosity. This feels like mania. Back in New York I have ten dollars out for the cabbie on the way home from JFK and put two back in my wallet. Shameful. I go to a crowded resolutions-fresh yoga class. I typically set up in the front row, not because I am good at yoga but because I want as few toned yoga bodies in my line of sight as possible. A Lululemon doyenne with the triceps to show for it takes her place to my right, and I wedge into the front corner with the wall to my left. Perfect, I think. Just one other human in my peripheral vision, the rest of the class a jam-packed sweaty moving organism of good intentions. I will really kick this year off right. Once the sun salutations begin, my neighbor flings her arms out to the side to Namaste the morning. She makes strong contact with me and gives not a nod of apology or acknowledgment. Oh well, I think. Round two, smacks me again! Every New Yorker knows well and good that in a crowded yoga studio you throw your arms up, not out. Round three, full on bopped this time! My heart starts pounding. She\u2019s interrupting my flow with zero regard! After exchanging sweat with this precious soul several more times, and audibly sighing with each brush of her manicured hand, I decide: Fuck it. I will extend generosity to her by allowing her to hit me. I will offer my body to her as a battering ram for full sun salutation. This requires much deep breathing on my part in lieu of biting her, but I am shifting my mind toward expansive acceptance rather than anger at a person oblivious to my moral outrage. I still want to bite her. I go to work on my laptop at a coffee shop near my house. I usually tip my beloved baristas $1 \u2014 and only about half the time, depending on my feelings of poverty that day. I will do this only if the coffee slinger sees me, in the sad hope that maybe she\u2019ll give me an extra shot of espresso for free. But not today! I slip two dollars into the jar while the woman working the counter grabs my drink. She doesn\u2019t even see me do it. I am basically Mother Teresa. The super in my building is a lanky fellow named Junior. He runs a small racket out of the recycling in the basement, distributing cans and bottles to neighborhood vagrants who line up around 10 a.m. every other day, for which I imagine Junior is taking a cut. Since I work from home and walk the dog around this time, I have a front row seat to the cottage industry. Junior will often stop me to kvetch about the weather for a while, then ask me \u201cto hold ten dollars\u201d so he can buy cigarettes. I rarely carry cash as part of an ill-advised ploy to spend less. I instead offer cigarettes from my own aging stash. He refuses, preferring Kools. Today we go through the same rigmarole, and in my wallet, I have a twenty, not a ten. \u201cHere, take this,\u201d I say, my hand quivering in giving over an Andrew Jackson. Junior is pumped and promises to get me back in the next few days. I never see the money again. If I claimed this was an act of selfless generosity, I\u2019d be lying. Junior lives in the apartment above me and often cares for his toddler granddaughter, whose bedtime is around 1 am. Junior seems to be prepping for his Riverdance audition both day and night. It is not infrequent that I will stomp upstairs after midnight in my housecoat asking in my white girl voice to \u201cPlease be mindful, as I am trying to get some sleep.\u201d I\u2019m hoping the crisp $20 will buy me some quiet. It does not. I\u2019ve been meditating for a few years now, and not because I am virtuous. I have to meditate for 15 minutes each day in order to not get arrested. I bust out my meditation technique prior to nerve-wracking situations, like giving a talk. I\u2019ll begin to summon the feeling I\u2019d like to exude, sit on a few couch cushions, take some deep breaths and visualize myself fielding questions and criticisms with a smile and \u00e9lan. I\u2019ve been trying the same strategy in the morning for the past week or so to psyche myself up to be generous. I close my eyes, picture an exhausted mother with bratty children entering the subway and see myself magnanimously, selflessly, standing up for her. Other passengers notice my benevolence, maybe even rousing inspiration. I see myself standing aside in line, letting some harried citizen to cut me. The bill comes after a big dinner with friends, and I quietly pick it up. The waitress even writes a small note on the receipt: If only there were more people like you. But today it isn\u2019t working. Seeing the slideshow of generous events only makes me feel stricken with anxiety, more aware of my limitations. So I try something different. I instead conjure the feeling of having enough, visualizing what that would look like. I see myself engaged in each moment of my life \u2014 the tedious answering of emails, listening to my boyfriend instead of unloading on him, responding to prison letters for my new book project with the utmost care. My bank account doesn\u2019t contain a certain target number, but I engage a feeling of peace toward it. I try to sit in the sensation of having enough, feeling generosity move through me. I am the conduit \u2014 the thing I am giving away was never mine in the first place.My chest begins to swell and my limbs experience a pleasant, groggy glow. I feel rooted to the ground in a way that doesn\u2019t seem ponderous. I feel bolstered instead of weighed down. Rather than picturing myself giving, I reverse engineer the feeling of abundance to make that the baseline for the day. I manage to: I felt a little surge, a little electrical current of belonging, each time. Belonging to what? I\u2019m not quite sure, but it was something bigger than my own plight. There\u2019s a homeless woman who sits in front of the falafel place near my boyfriend\u2019s apartment. I can understand the words she says individually, but collectively they make no sense. She has a kindly way about her, so I call her Eunice. Today I pack up a sack of food to give her on my way to the gym \u2014 clementines, granola bars, bananas, trail mix \u2014 a cornucopia of organic Brooklyn fare. I hand it to her, and she is gracious. I see her carefully stuff it into the innards of several bags nestled inside one another like skins. She smiles, I smile back. She thanks me, and I say \u201cyou\u2019re welcome.\u201d It\u2019s all so easy. I could do this every day. I am a motherfucking saint. On my way back to Scott\u2019s building, I see his neighbor. She\u2019s wheeling a little grocery cart, closes in on Eunice, and\u2026she\u2019s giving it to her! Goddamn her! Here\u2019s something Eunice can actually use! I was supposed to be the good person today, and here she goes, showing me up. Perhaps I still have a few dark and petty corners where the light of generosity could give a good scrub. I have volunteered to subject myself to something called MulchFest. It\u2019s Sunday. I\u2019m hungover, it\u2019s freezing, and Scott is sprawled out on the couch with coffee and The New York Times. I sit with him and debate the relative merits of submitting myself to the elements, and to the perky knowingness of the Park Slope canvas bag-toting crowd. Scott is from the Midwest and believes that life should be difficult. I put on two pairs of socks and my heaviest coat and head out. I\u2019m several hours late and somebody in a neon pinafore hands me a clicker counter to tick off the trees as they get mulched. I have the overwhelming urge to punch my thumb down, to feel the satisfying click click click but know this will irretrievably fuck up the count. So I stand at attention, desperately resisting the urge to pull out my phone and appear occupied. The point of MulchFest, I have decided, is to commune with my surroundings, my neighbors, to behold the circle of life as manifested by browning pine needles, the melancholy stench of decomposition signaling the promise of a new year. A fellow who looks to me like a human hacky sack sees me with my brow furrowed and waiting to count trees that never arrive. Everyone is still at lunch, he informs me. I return the clicker and he gently ushers me over to a little white tent and presents me with a new task: creating pine sachets from freshly mulched trees to distribute to park patrons. The rhythm of dipping a trowel into the needles and tying off the bag is lulling, relaxing. I merchandise my wares attractively on a card table. Park goers stop by and ask, \u201cMay I take one?\u201d \u201cTake TWO!\u201d I implore, \u201cand a snack!\u201d chucking an apple and a granola bar at them. I am giving people something they want, for free, something crafted by these two hands. I\u2019m loving this. An hour and a half passes and it feels like but a moment. I\u2019m in love with Brooklyn, with humanity. I once dated a journalist who never stopped giving \u2014 to strangers, to the less fortunate, to people he was writing about, mostly. Every Sunday morning, Rob would throw back the comforter and go to prepare lunch for homeless people in a church basement. He became close with one of the regulars, helping him advocate to get his VA benefits reinstated, putting his name on housing lottery lists, taking him to doctor\u2019s appointments for his chronic pain. Rob was widely regarded as someone who would interrupt his life for the benefit of others, one of the most generous people anyone had ever known. But I could never get him to open up to me, not in any deepening intimacy. A frustrating part of our relationship was how his service made him somehow unimpeachable. To whom are we generous, and why? For Rob, caring for strangers came second nature. For me, not so much. Looking back, I think Rob threw himself into others because he was a little scared of his own life, and of people getting close. Giving, for him, was, in part, a way to hide. This is an ungenerous interpretation, I realize \u2014 but on which side of the ledger does our giving fall? And who is keeping score? The worst words a New Yorker can hear on the subway: What time is it? SHOWTIME! Out-of-town visitors film the acrobatics with glee while I contract further into myself. I give a dollar to Showtime, which I loathe. But giving the dollar somehow makes me loathe them less. I am still meditating in my new style, conjuring a sense of abundance. The phrase that came to me today was \u201cless afraid.\u201d In that tiny moment in the morning, I certainly feel a wash of quiet confidence. Getting up off my meditation cushion, well, that\u2019s a different story. I understand my little experiment is made possible by the fact of my privileges: I enjoy a degree of freedom and mobility unknown any time in previous human history. I am in charge of keeping alive no one but myself and a 15-pound dog. My career choices may not pay in money, but I am wealthy in time, flexibility, and multiple breakfasts. I\u2019m healthy and able-bodied. Perhaps my generosity experiment is a foray into a kind of first-world problem, manufacturing a false sense of adversity. What would, say, a single mom think of my enterprise? I ask the best one I know: my own. I give her a call and explain the project. \u201cWhat would you have said to somebody embarking on such a journey back when my sister and I were younger?\u201d \u201cWell, I can tell you what I would\u2019ve thought,\u201d she says laughing with the irreverence that is my genetic inheritance. \u201cMy whole life is about being generous to my children. I use up my finite supply of generosity in keeping the household together.\u201d It\u2019s true. I remember her falling asleep on the couch by 9 p.m. every night of my childhood. \u201cBut generosity can also be about receiving, allowing others to be generous to you,\u201d I counter. \u201cWhen I was raising you guys, I had to convince myself of my own strength. I had to get into the mindset that I was capable of doing this on my own. If the spark plug went out on the lawnmower, then I needed to know how to fix it myself.\u201d Then she tells me something I didn\u2019t know: \u201cI also felt so alone, and I didn\u2019t want to depend on anyone else. And then you start to build up walls, and even a martyr complex, like, \u2018I\u2019m the good responsible one, I have to be sensible.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt does seem we expect more automatic generosity from women, and are then delightfully surprised when men go beyond themselves, huh?\u201d I say. \u201cHell, yes! Women are always putting other people first. All our energy goes into other people. Think about Grammy, her life was cut short because of it,\u201d my mom says breathlessly. My grandmother had three kids, a paraplegic husband, a rural mail route as a postal worker, her elderly parents across the street, a dozen grandchildren, and innumerable wayward souls she cared for. She literally worked herself to death. \u201cIf you could go back in time, what generosity would you have offered yourself?\u201d I ask. \u201cI would\u2019ve just allowed myself to take more time for me, I suppose. I could\u2019ve hired a babysitter for the night, but that seemed unthinkable. Same too with little splurges, like a facial or a massage. Those lines just seemed so clear to me then, and I couldn\u2019t cross them. It\u2019s not selfish to take care of yourself.\u201d she says. One of the greatest generosities I\u2019ve known is when strangers reach out to let me know they\u2019ve enjoyed my book. This means more to me than any review or professional accolade; it buoys me during the rough times and makes my whole day. I think about how many books I\u2019ve devoured and recommended to anyone who will listen \u2014 save the author. So today I send laudatory notes, thanking writers whose work has meant much to me. When you truly love something, there is nothing easier or more natural in the world than to say so. I write my friend Amitava, letting him know I will teach his essay about performing Hindu burial rites for his mother, and how moving I found his recollection. I send an earnest letter of gratitude to a beloved actress thanking her for a recent personal essay she wrote about her relationship with reviews, and how it made me feel less alone. I write an Irish fellow about how much I enjoyed an excerpt of his book. Though it feels a bit awkward to telegraph admiration to total strangers, the feeling of lift far outweighs the embarrassment. It feels like an unburdening. Generosity, thus far, has proved illuminating when giving comes easily \u2014 giving compliments, sending texts to friends trying to brighten their day, in little gestures like getting up to offer a lady in nurse\u2019s scrubs my subway seat. But money is where I am stuck. Scarcity is the heart of my fear. Being in deep student loan debt and in precarious employment, my inner monologue is a stream of calculations, always trying to suss out how many more months I can exist in New York. Instead of getting a real handle on my finances, like by following a budget, I adhere to Coinstar, consigning clothes, cooking big batches of chili to eat throughout the week, and prayer. So today I decide to give away money. I send $10 to a friend of a friend\u2019s GoFundMe to help replace clothes and furniture lost in a fire. I then notice more calls for help which I skillfully tend to ignore \u2014 $10 to a friend\u2019s sister\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s sister\u2019s fundraiser to get a seeing-eye dog, $10 to my second cousin who wants to record a demo of songs. And because we live in end times I send $10 to the ACLU, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and Planned Parenthood. Then I give a whopping $50 to WNYC because it\u2019s pledge drive time and every little bit helps.That\u2019s $110 in total. Turns out that donating via the internet is pretty much like any kind of online shopping: You end up spending far more than you would if the cold currency were to physically depart from your wallet. By evening I receive an email from a former tutoring client about starting sessions with her younger son, and another query about subletting my room. Did parting with my funds send a rupture of wealth through the universe? Did I just manifest money by giving it away? Steeped in the culture of The Secret and living in late capitalism, it\u2019s tough to imagine giving without getting anything back in return. Does this mean my project is sullied? I decide to take this line of inquiry to somebody who may know. I meet Richard Bascetta, a senior Buddhist teacher at the Shambhala Center of New York, for coffee. He\u2019s a bit of a silver fox and wears cool square-framed glasses. I explain my project and my query \u2014 how can we give selflessly without expecting anything back? Since this giving thing has been feeling pretty good, is it okay to use generosity as a panacea to feeling bad? Richard has lived in New York and practiced Buddhism here for decades, and realizes generosity\u2019s challenges: \u201cIn this environment, we are fighting for space, for money, for status, for a fear of not having that money and status. People come here to accomplish. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a good writer, but there are at least a hundred people here who are as good or better.\u201d Damn, Richard. \u201cOur inertia typically prevents us from acting for others,\u201d he says, his eyes never wavering from my gaze. \u201cWe buffer ourselves through our lives. Through parenting, running a business, careers, chasing one love after another, our anger \u2014 whatever buffers us from the rawness of the moment. The more layers we put on like an itchy coat, the more difficult it is to access a sense of generosity. Generosity, in its most powerful form, is breaking through the inertia.\u201d Richard tells me that a few years back he started carrying a stack of ones in his front pocket. Each time he\u2019d pass a panhandler or street musician whose tunes he admired, he\u2019d drop a dollar in their cup. But lately, he\u2019s been pulling his hand back. And he\u2019s not sure why. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pinching reminder that I\u2019m compromising my original intention\u2014to give regardless of my inner commentary about the person,\u201d he says. But he doesn\u2019t see this as all bad: \u201cIt\u2019s given me the chance to reflect and see how my judgments get in the way and clog the flow of generosity.\u201d Richard assures me this is okay, because the benefit of generosity \u2014 beyond how good it feels, beyond helping someone else \u2014 is that it reveals to us where we are stuck. \u201cWe are working with that resistance. Where does that mistrust and worry reside in you? That\u2019s the investigation.\u201d Buddhists believe that one moment of presence is a moment of enlightenment. And when I think back over the past month, I see I\u2019ve built a repository of these moments: connecting with Eunice before I was shown up; becoming hypnotized by the rhythm of filling a cloth bag with pine needles; hearing about a time in my mom\u2019s life that was a struggle. Enlightenment is a distant shore for me but these moments are undeniably fractals of a larger mosaic. On Inauguration Day I take a train to Philadelphia to rendezvous with my sister, mom, and aunt, where we will set out for the Women\u2019s March before dawn the next day. I expect to have many opportunities to exercise generosity, what with thousands of strangers vying for catharsis and a bathroom. The last time I saw my sister was over Christmas, when she called me a sausage, referring to the growing weight differential between us. I close my eyes on the train and silently release that hardened gem of hurt. The release is more gestural than actual, a bit of fake-it-till-you-make-it. We are on the road and our excitement swells as we pass dozens of charter buses at rest stops and see pink floppy hats all around. But when we go to drop our bags at our hotel, it hits me. The inauguration crowd is still in town. Staying at our Marriott Courtyard just outside the Pentagon are not only protesters of the new regime but supporters as well. I see whole families decked out in matching red hats and commemorative t-shirts. My body seizes up. I actually feel terrified of these people, even though I think the fear is irrational. I\u2019d been envisioning practicing my giving toward allies, my family, people as outraged as me. Now I have to dive deep into the wells of whatever reserves of compassion I\u2019ve been cultivating over the month toward my perceived enemies. How can I engage those from the other side? What will be my part in making things better? I decide today will be about extending generosity to these folks, to people who took off work and spent their hard-earned money to bear witness and lend their enthusiasm to the installation of our new president. The march itself is magical, and exhausting, and inspiring. I behold so much generosity around me: There are people passing around bags of trail mix and carrot sticks; people creating a human microphone to reunite a lost child with her mother; there are cops and medics rushing to help the fallen in the crush of humans. But what impresses me most about the day is the new reality we live in. I feel safe and secure in the sea of witty signs and like-minded representatives of the popular vote. But the second we break away and walk along the Mall we pass more Trump supporters. What would my generosity even look like to them? Would it register? Right now the most generous thing I can do is to not push them into traffic on Independence Avenue. But I think about a quote, supposedly from the Dalai Lama: \u201cIf you can, help others; if you cannot do that, at least do not harm them.\u201d As we walk back across the bridge toward Arlington Cemetery, where my grandfather, a veteran of World War II and Korea is buried, I lag behind. The day is gray, thick, and unseasonably warm. We are all hungry and cranky, legs achy from standing for hours. In the distance, I see a pack of white boys in red caps walking toward us. My body responds before my brain, sensing a threat. They pass my mom and sister, who are still wearing their pink hats, ahead of me. I took mine off when we left the March because I am an actual pussy, fearful a Trump supporter would hurl an epithet or punch me in the face. When I catch up with them, my mom and sister seem shaken and tired, trying to be stoic. \u201cThey called us \u2018clits,\u2019\u201d my mom says, shaking her head. Now my limbic system is just confused, outraged that these assholes would dare speak to anyone, let alone two women. But I\u2019m doubly confused because \u201cclit\u201d is perhaps the most bizarre term they could have lobbed. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t know where to locate one on a human female!\u201d I counter. I try to make light of it, but we are all on edge. Back at the hotel, the air conditioning is blasting and we devour our burgers. More white people are milling around in stars-and-stripes gear. It occurs to me I have a choice. I can treat all of these people as a monolith of hatred and ignorance, or try to see them as individuals. The results are nothing stunning: I allow a Trump-supporting couple to enter the elevator ahead of me. I move my bag at breakfast the next morning so a teenage girl in a red cap can sit down. I leave a tip for the housekeeper, her political affiliations unknown. I let the same Trump-supporting couple board the airport courtesy van first. It doesn\u2019t matter, we\u2019re all going to the same place anyway. *** The month ends. By my count I\u2019ve given away 19 subway seats, picked up the check at dinner and drinks half a dozen times, sent 36 \u201cI just called to say I love you\u201d texts to friends, sent $320 dollars to different fundraisers and organizations, given $47 to the homeless, and spent 15 hours of my life volunteering. I\u2019ve let Scott\u2019s innocent yet potentially inflammatory comments slide more times than my ego is comfortable with. I bought coffee and a sandwich for my ex without sending a Venmo request for the privilege. I traveled to distant neighborhoods to meet friends for dinner closer to where they live. I\u2019ve left notes in Scott\u2019s pockets for him to discover during the day. I\u2019ve bought bouquets of flowers to bestow upon unsuspecting pals. I\u2019ve done nothing but listen on the phone, seated, taking it in, when usually doing household chores simultaneously. I\u2019ve stayed past my office hours to meet a student who was freaking out about an assignment. I\u2019ve sent e-books to a friend to use while nursing. I\u2019ve been generous to myself by wearing the good underwear at the back of my drawer that I save for a special occasion that never comes. I\u2019ve tried to do only one thing at a time. But the experiment doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s over \u2014 I didn\u2019t do this perfectly. There were times when I grabbed a subway seat like manifest destiny. There was a time I decided to get offended by a friend\u2019s offhanded remark. I spent an afternoon at the Brooklyn Food Bank silently cursing the project director, who I took to be an imperious asshole. I noticed I have the hardest time letting things slide from the people closest to me. Like Richard said, examining oneself through the lens of generosity can be illuminating. At the beginning of the month I was listing all my generous acts. But by the end of the month, I was listing opportunities to be generous that I didn\u2019t take up. Those moments taught me more about myself. Instead of feeling defeated by my imperfection, I feel curious, inspired even. You make yourself vulnerable by making an offering the other may or may not take. You extend yourself in giving praise, attention, patience. You let the other in. You see the sky does not fall. You do it again. Giving becomes easier. Defensiveness can soften because you\u2019re not fighting to preserve what little you feel you have to protect. From the constant gnaw of scarcity, you realize there is enough. I\u2019m still grouchy as hell. But I\u2019ve found giving to be the easiest, quickest, even cheapest way to feel good, better than therapy, equine or otherwise. If I want to reset the chemistry of my brain on a particularly down day, I\u2019ll just try to listen to what someone is telling me. I\u2019ll text friends telling them how much I adore them. I\u2019ll buy coffee for the person behind me in line. And a little bit of the weight lifts. When I think back to the first day of my experiment, when I endured and paid for a frustrating lunch with Krista, I see it differently now. The truest generosity I could\u2019ve offered wouldn\u2019t have been in picking up the tab, but in looking directly in her eyes and meeting her where she is, where we all are: imperfect, flawed, all-too-human, locked into our own stories of what is going on, the only story we understand to be true. For all I know, she had to do deep breathing just to be around me. I haven\u2019t mastered generosity and the fearlessness that comes with it. But I\u2019ve touched it in moments. I want to experience more of those moments. And because life always gives us a heaping helping of stress and awkward lunches and unexpected vet bills, I know I will have more to do. Because I didn\u2019t die this month, nor did I go into the poorhouse, nor did I feel overextended. Instead, I felt connected. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by how much further I have to go, I feel ready. Instead of feeling stretched thin, I feel full. *** Elizabeth Greenwood is the author ofPlaying Dead: A Journey Through the World of Death Fraud, a nonfiction book about people who have faked their deaths. \u00a0",

Er habe zwar seine Posten im Landesvorstand und im Kreisvorstand im Havelland niedergelegt, wolle aber normales Mitglied bleiben, sagte der 48-J\u00e4hrige in Potsdam. \"Ich werde der AfD immer treu bleiben\", sagte er.</p> \n <p>Er wolle zwischen dem Islam und nationalkonservativen Deutschen vermitteln, sagte Wagner. Man m\u00fcsse Br\u00fccken bauen. Er war nach eigenen Angaben in den 1990er Jahren als Russlanddeutscher nach Deutschland gekommen. Seine Pressekonferenz war auch von Sprachproblemen gepr\u00e4gt. Er wolle jetzt besser deutsch lernen und Islamwissenschaften in einem Fernstudiengang studieren, sagte Wagner.</p> \n <p>Ein Zug mit Parlamentariern der US-Republikaner ist mit einem Lkw kollidiert. Das Wei\u00dfe Haus teilte mit, es habe einen Toten und einen Schwerverletzten gegeben, aber nicht unter den Mitgliedern von Repr\u00e4sentantenhaus und Senat. Von den Parlamentariern sei niemand \"schwer verletzt\" worden, erkl\u00e4rte die Sprecherin des Wei\u00dfen Hauses, Sarah Sanders. Ob es \u00fcberhaupt Verletzte unter den Kongressmitgliedern gab, war zun\u00e4chst unklar.<br></p> \n <p>Die Parlamentarier befanden sich auf dem Weg zu einer Klausurtagung in White Sulphur Springs im Bundesstaat West Virginia, als der Zug mit einem M\u00fcllwagen zusammenprallte. Der Abgeordnete Bradley Byrne schrieb kurz nach dem Vorfall im Internetdienst Twitter, Sicherheitspersonal und \u00c4rzte bef\u00e4nden sich an Bord des Zuges, \"um den Ort abzusichern und Verletzte zu behandeln\". Er teilte jedoch nicht mit, ob es sich bei den Verletzten um Kongressmitglieder handelte.</p> \n <p>Die Schweiz will mit neuer Dynamik wieder Bewegung in die stockenden Verhandlungen mit der EU \u00fcber engere Beziehungen bringen. Die Eidgenossenschaft habe neue Ideen und wolle das Thema k\u00fcnftig viel offensiver angehen, sagte Au\u00dfenminister Ignazio Cassis in Bern. \"Wir sind bereit, vorw\u00e4rts zu gehen.\" Die wirtschaftlichen, politischen und kulturellen Verflechtungen seien tief. \"Wir sind ein Teil Europas, auch wenn wir nicht zur EU geh\u00f6ren.\" </p> \n <p>Es bestehe ein Zeitfenster von etwa zehn Monaten, um die Beziehungen zwischen der EU und der Schweiz neu zu regeln. 2019 sei keine Bewegung zu erwarten, war sich Cassis sicher. Dann kommt es voraussichtlich zum Brexit, das Europ\u00e4ische Parlament sowie der Schweizer Nationalrat werden gew\u00e4hlt. </p> \n <p>Die Schweiz strebt laut Cassis den \"bestm\u00f6glichen Marktzugang und die gr\u00f6\u00dftm\u00f6gliche Eigenst\u00e4ndigkeit\" an. Das Land hat sich zwar gegen eine EU-Mitgliedschaft entschieden, hat aber \u00fcber bilaterale Vertr\u00e4ge Zugang zum EU-Binnenmarkt. Ein Rahmenabkommen soll diese Beziehung neu regeln. Die Verhandlungen dauern bereits seit rund vier Jahren.</p> \n <p>Am Landgericht T\u00fcbingen hat der Prozess gegen einen jungen Mann wegen zwei Vergewaltigungen und zwei versuchten Vergewaltigungen begonnen. Er soll im Mai und Oktober 2015 drei Frauen auf ihrem Heimweg von Partys abgepasst und angegriffen haben, hei\u00dft es in der Anklage. Au\u00dferdem soll er im Februar 2017 eine behinderte Frau unter einem Vorwand zu sich eingeladen und vergewaltigt haben.</p> \n <p>Zum Prozessauftakt wollte der nach eigenen Angaben 22-j\u00e4hrige Mann zu mindestens einer Tat aussagen. Die \u00d6ffentlichkeit wurde aber ausgeschlossen, weil der Mann zum Tatzeitpunkt m\u00f6glicherweise noch Heranwachsender war. Der Angeklagte stammt aus Gambia und war vor drei Jahren nach Deutschland gekommen. Laut Staatsanwaltschaft hat er verschiedene Geburtsdaten angegeben. Am Gerichtsverfahren ist ein Sachverst\u00e4ndiger zur Frage der Alterfeststellung beteiligt. Das Urteil wird f\u00fcr 27. M\u00e4rz erwartet.</p> \n <p>Nach den j\u00fcngsten R\u00fcckschl\u00e4gen hat der katalanische Separatisten-Chef Carles Puigdemont in einer privaten Mitteilung das Ende der Unabh\u00e4ngigkeitsbewegung in der spanischen Konfliktregion einger\u00e4umt. Die Zentralregierung in Madrid habe gewonnen, schrieb Puigdemont seinem politischen Mitstreiter Toni Com\u00edn per Kurzmitteilungsdienst Signal. Die Zeilen wurden vom TV-Sender \"Telecinco\" enth\u00fcllt. Ein Journalist habe unbemerkt das Display des Handys von Com\u00edn fotografiert, als er seine Mitteilungen gelesen habe, berichtete der Sender.<br></p> \n <p>Puigdemont blieb nichts anderes \u00fcbrig, als die Echtheit der \"abgefangenen\" Botschaften zu best\u00e4tigen. Der nach seiner Absetzung als katalanischer Regionalpr\u00e4sident seit Ende Oktober in Belgien im Exil lebende 55-J\u00e4hrige bestritt allerdings, dass er aufgibt. \"Wir machen weiter!\", beteuerte er auf Twitter.</p> \n <p><br></p> \n <p>Nach dem Erfolg der Separatisten bei der Neuwahl im Dezember war Puigdemont vom katalanischen Parlamentspr\u00e4sidenten Roger Torrent zum Kandidaten ernannt worden. Am Dienstag erlitt er aber einen schweren R\u00fcckschlag: Die Debatte im Regionalparlament in Barcelona \u00fcber seine Wiederwahl wurde von Torrent auf Anordnung des Verfassungsgerichts in Madrid bis auf Weiteres vertagt. </p> \n <p>Die Zentrale Stelle zur Aufkl\u00e4rung nationalsozialistischer Verbrechen in Ludwigsburg hat weitere mutma\u00dfliche NS-Verbrecher ausfindig gemacht. Die Staatsanwaltschaft Erfurt habe auf Grundlage ihrer Recherchen die Ermittlungen gegen f\u00fcnf ehemalige SS-Wachm\u00e4nner des Konzentrationslagers Buchenwald bei Weimar aufgenommen, sagte ein Sprecher der Staatsanwaltschaft auf Anfrage. Die Vorw\u00fcrfe lauteten auf Beihilfe zum Mord. Die M\u00e4nner seien heute zwischen 92 und 96 Jahre alt. Zuvor hatte die Tageszeitung <a href=\"http://www.taz.de/\">\"taz\"</a> \u00fcber die Ermittlungen berichtet.</p> \n <p>Die Beschuldigten leben in Th\u00fcringen, Berlin, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Bayern und im Rheinland, wie der Leiter der Zentralen Stelle zur Aufkl\u00e4rung nationalsozialistischer Verbrechen, Jens Rommel, am Mittwoch sagte. Sie sind demnach zwischen Juni 1921 und November 1925 geboren. Rommel sagte, vier der der Beschuldigten seien in der \"Sp\u00e4tphase\" von Buchenwald dort eingesetzt worden, also 1944/45.</p> \n <p>Saisonbedingt ist die Zahl der Arbeitslosen in Deutschland im Januar gestiegen - im Vergleich zum Vormonat um 185.000 auf 2,57 Millionen. Das ist jedoch der niedrigste Wert in diesem Monat seit mehr als 25 Jahren. Der Anstieg fiel nach Angaben der Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Arbeit (BA) in N\u00fcrnberg auch geringer aus als \u00fcblich. Gegen\u00fcber dem Vorjahr ging die Zahl der Erwerbslosen um 207.000 zur\u00fcck, wie die BA mitteilte. Die Arbeitslosenquote stieg um 0,5 Punkte auf 5,8 Prozent. Die Bundesagentur f\u00fchrt die Zunahme auf die Winterpause zur\u00fcck. </p> \n <p>Ein Karnevalist hat Kanzlerin Angela Merkel und SPD-Chef Martin Schulz Kost\u00fcmempfehlungen gegeben. Merkel k\u00f6nne am besten als Elbin gehen, Schulz als Clown, sagte Klaus-Ludwig Fess, Pr\u00e4sident des Bundes Deutscher Karneval, der <a href=\"http://www.fr.de/\">\"Frankfurter Rundschau\"</a>. Merkel \"sollte ein elbenhaftes Kost\u00fcm tragen - wie bei \"Der Herr der Ringe\"\", meinte Fess. Denn die CDU-Chefin sei sehr staatsm\u00e4nnisch und strahle Ruhe aus. Schulz hingegen sei \"irgendwie eine tragikomische Figur\". Allerdings: \"Ein Clown steht auch f\u00fcr Humor, Frohsinn, Heiterkeit und bringt Menschen zum Lachen. Und das ist in diesen Zeiten doch auch nicht verkehrt.\" </p> \n <p>In Bayern ist ein sogenannter Reichsb\u00fcrger wegen Bedrohung von Beh\u00f6rdenmitarbeitern und weiterer Straftaten zu einer Gef\u00e4ngnisstrafe von 15 Monaten ohne Bew\u00e4hrung verurteilt worden. Der 51-J\u00e4hrige aus dem schw\u00e4bischen Donauw\u00f6rth hatte laut Anklage unter anderem den Mitarbeitern der Generalstaatsanwaltschaft in M\u00fcnchen in einem Schreiben mit der Hinrichtung gedroht. Der Angeklagte habe die Vorw\u00fcrfe nicht bestritten, teilte das Amtsgericht Aichach mit. Er habe jedoch klar gemacht, dass er die Justiz nicht anerkenne. \"Reichsb\u00fcrger\" lehnen die Bundesrepublik als Staat ab und behaupten, das Deutsche Reich bestehe fort. Seit Jahren besch\u00e4ftigen sie die deutschen Gerichte. Die Prozesse finden dabei h\u00e4ufig mit erh\u00f6hten Sicherheitsvorkehrungen statt.</p> \n <p>Nach dem Angriff eines aggressiven Gockels im bayerischen Landkreis Ebersberg m\u00fcssen die Besitzer des Tieres einem Bauaufseher rund 37.500 Euro Schmerzensgeld und Schadenersatz zahlen. Der Streit ging vor dem Oberlandesgericht M\u00fcnchen in die zweite Instanz und endete mit einem entsprechenden Vergleich.<br></p> \n <p>Der Mann war mit Stra\u00dfenbauarbeiten in der N\u00e4he des Grundst\u00fccks der Beklagten im Landkreis Ebersberg besch\u00e4ftigt. Er sei von dem Hahn angegriffen worden und beim Ausweichversuch r\u00fcckw\u00e4rts \u00fcber die Stra\u00dfenkante gestolpert, sagte er sp\u00e4ter zu dem Vorfall. Dabei habe er sich einen Wirbel gebrochen.</p> \n <p>Frankreichs Pr\u00e4sident Emmanuel Macron hat die T\u00fcrkei im Hinblick auf ihre Milit\u00e4roffensive in Syrien vor einer \"Invasion\"<br>gewarnt. Sollte der Einsatz eine andere Wendung nehmen als eine Aktion gegen Terror und sich als Invasion herausstellen, \"dann w\u00fcrde diese Operation f\u00fcr uns ein echtes Problem darstellen\", sagte er der Zeitung \"Le Figaro\".</p> \n <p>Die T\u00fcrkei geht in der Region Afrin in Nordwestsyrien seit dem 20. Januar gegen die Kurdenmiliz YPG vor. Macron sprach sich wegen der Offensive f\u00fcr Gespr\u00e4che und Entscheidungen zwischen Europ\u00e4ern und \"breiter unter Verb\u00fcndeten\" aus. \"Denn sie ver\u00e4ndert die Natur dieses t\u00fcrkischen Eindringens, und deshalb werde ich in den kommenden Tagen erneut mit (dem t\u00fcrkischen Pr\u00e4sidenten Recep Tayyip) Erdogan sprechen.\" Laut dem Blatt gab Macron das Interview nach einem Abendessen der armenischen Gemeinschaft Frankreichs in Paris.</p> \n <p>Der t\u00fcrkische Ministerpr\u00e4sident Binali Yildirim entgegnete: \"Die ganze Welt wei\u00df und sollte wissen, dass die T\u00fcrkei keinesfalls mit einer Logik der Besatzung vorgeht.\" Wenn Frankreich das so verstehe, m\u00fcsse man seine Aktivit\u00e4ten in Syrien genauso bewerten.</p> \n <p>Nach scharfer Kritik hat die ukrainische Regierung die vier EU-Staaten Malta, Estland, Lettland und Ungarn wieder von einer schwarzen Liste f\u00fcr Steueroasen gestrichen. Dies teilte Regierungschef Wladimir Groisman der staatlichen Agentur Ukrinform zufolge mit. Von der erst am 1. Januar ver\u00f6ffentlichten Liste wurde demnach auch der Kaukasusstaat Georgien gestrichen. Die estnische Regierung begr\u00fc\u00dfte den Schritt. \"Ich bin froh, dass die ukrainischen Kollegen schnell gehandelt haben\", sagte Regierungschef J\u00fcri Ratas einer Mitteilung der Staatskanzlei in Tallinn zufolge.</p> \n <p>Angesichts der Emp\u00f6rung \u00fcber Diesel-Abgastests mit Affen haben die beteiligten deutschen Autohersteller der Bundesregierung Konsequenzen zugesichert. Vertreter von VW, Daimler und BMW h\u00e4tten eigene Studien mit Forschungen an Lebewesen zuk\u00fcnftig ausgeschlossen, teilte das Verkehrsministerium nach einer Sondersitzung seiner Abgas-Untersuchungskommission mit.<br></p> \n <p>Die Unternehmen wollten sich direkt oder indirekt nur noch an Studien beteiligen, bei denen die Einhaltung geltenden deutschen Rechts und deutscher Ethikgrunds\u00e4tze gew\u00e4hrleistet sei. Die Hersteller wollten zudem pr\u00fcfen, ob es noch andere Vereine wie die EUGT gibt. </p> \n <p> </p> \n <p>Der deutsche Europaabgeordnete Udo Bullmann \u00fcbernimmt f\u00fcr etwa einen Monat den Fraktionsvorsitz der europ\u00e4ischen Sozialdemokraten. Das k\u00fcndigte der bisherige Fraktionschef Gianni Pittella in Br\u00fcssel an. Pittella kandidiert f\u00fcr die italienischen Parlamentswahlen am 4. M\u00e4rz. Er will sein Amt w\u00e4hrend des Wahlkampfes ruhen lassen. Sollte er gew\u00e4hlt werden, werde er am 7. M\u00e4rz vor dem EU-Parlament seinen R\u00fccktritt erkl\u00e4ren, sagte der Italiener vor Journalisten. In diesem Fall werde anschlie\u00dfend die Wahl seines Nachfolgers vorbereitet.</p> \n <p>Udo Bullmann ist im Europaparlament Vize-Fraktionschef der europ\u00e4ischen Sozialdemokraten. Der 61-J\u00e4hrige aus dem hessischen Gie\u00dfen wird in Medienberichten bereits als dauerhafter Nachfolger Pittellas gehandelt.</p> \n <p>Die iranische Staatsanwaltschaft will hart gegen die wachsende Zahl der \"Anti-Kopftuch-Demonstrantinnen\" durchgreifen. \"Das Kopftuch in der \u00d6ffentlichkeit abzunehmen ist gegen das Gesetz und die islamische Pflicht und daher eine eindeutige Straftat\", sagte Teherans Staatsanwalt Abbas Dschafar Dolatabadi. Er best\u00e4tigte, dass mindestens eine Demonstrantin festgenommen und eingesperrt worden sei. Die Staatsanwaltschaft werde diesbez\u00fcglich \"ihre Pflicht konsequent erf\u00fcllen\", warnte Dolatabadi nach Angaben der Nachrichtenagentur Ilna.</p> \n <p>Als Protest gegen den Kopftuchzwang im Iran nehmen immer wieder Frauen auf den Stra\u00dfen ihre Kopft\u00fccher ab und h\u00e4ngen sie als Fahne an einen Stock. Bis jetzt sollen ein Dutzend Frauen an der Aktion teilgenommen haben. F\u00fcr den Staat werden die \"Anti-Kopftuch-Proteste\" in Teheran und anderen St\u00e4dten allm\u00e4hlich zu einem ernsten Problem.</p> \n <p>Die Schweizer Luftwaffe \u00fcberpr\u00fcft vorsorglich ihre 30 Kampfflugzeuge vom Typ F/A-18C Hornet auf Sch\u00e4den an der Landeklappe. Bei einem Kontrollflug sei ein Bruch in einem Befestigungsscharnier der Landeklappe entdeckt worden, teilte die Regierung mit. Als Vorsichtsma\u00dfnahme f\u00fcr die Flugt\u00fcchtigkeit und -sicherheit w\u00fcrden nun die Befestigungsscharniere dieses Jets vor dem n\u00e4chsten Flug einer Risspr\u00fcfung unterzogen.<br></p> \n <p>Bis Donnerstagabend sollen alle Hornet \u00fcberpr\u00fcft sein. \"Solange ein Flugzeug nicht \u00fcberpr\u00fcft ist, solange startet es nicht\", sagte ein Sprecher. Die f\u00fcr den Luftpolizeidienst eingesetzten Jets w\u00fcrden vorrangig \u00fcberpr\u00fcft. Damit werde die Interventionsf\u00e4higkeit der Luftwaffe, die auch \u00fcber Maschinen vom Typ Tiger verf\u00fcge, sichergestellt.</p> \n <p>F\u00fcnf Jugendliche und ein junger Mann sind in Thailand wegen Majest\u00e4tsbeleidigung zu mehrj\u00e4hrigen Gef\u00e4ngnisstrafen verurteilt worden. Die sechs Angeklagten wurden nach Angaben ihrer Anw\u00e4lte schuldig gesprochen, Portr\u00e4ts von Mitgliedern des thail\u00e4ndischen K\u00f6nigshauses in Brand gesetzt zu haben. Das harte Urteil reiht sich ein in eine Entwicklung hin zu immer h\u00f6heren Strafen f\u00fcr die Diffamierung der k\u00f6niglichen Familie in dem s\u00fcdostasiatischen Land.<br></p> \n <p>Die Anklage lautete nach Angaben der Organisation Thail\u00e4ndische Anw\u00e4lte f\u00fcr Menschenrechte unter anderem auf Majest\u00e4tsbeleidigung, Brandstiftung, und Sachbesch\u00e4digung. Vier von ihnen erhielten Gef\u00e4ngnisstrafen von elfeinhalb beziehungsweise sieben Jahren und acht Monaten. Die \u00fcbrigen zwei m\u00fcssen f\u00fcr drei Jahre und vier Monate ins Gef\u00e4ngnis.</p> \n <p>Die Staatsanwaltschaft Stuttgart ermittelt seit vergangener Woche gegen zwei Mitarbeiter des Autozulieferers Bosch. Wie die Staatsanwaltschaft mitteilte, verd\u00e4chtigt sie die beiden der Beihilfe zum Betrug im Zusammenhang mit Abgas-Betrugssoftware bei Dieselautos. Konkret geht um einen Jeep Grand Cherokee und einen Pick-up des Typs Dodge Ram 1500 des US-Autoherstellers Chrysler, die mit einer Abschaltvorrichtung des Abgasreinigungssystems ausgestattet worden sind.<br></p> \n <p>Die Staatsanwaltschaft geht davon aus, dass \"die relevanten Tatbeitr\u00e4ge\" dazu in ihrem Zust\u00e4ndigkeitsbereich geleistet wurden. Bosch erkl\u00e4rte dazu, die Firma kooperiere \"uneingeschr\u00e4nkt\" seit Bekanntwerden der Vorw\u00fcrfe mit den Ermittlern. Weiter wollte sich der Autozulieferer nicht \u00e4u\u00dfern<br></p> \n <p>Nach dem Fund von 500 Kilogramm Kokain in einem Privatjet in Gro\u00dfbritannien m\u00fcssen sich f\u00fcnf M\u00e4nner vor Gericht verantworten. Die Drogen im Wert von \u00fcber 50 Millionen Pfund (etwa 57 Millionen Euro) waren in 15 Koffern in dem aus Kolumbien kommenden Flugzeug versteckt. Es handelt sich um einen der gr\u00f6\u00dften Funde dieser Art in den vergangenen Jahren in Gro\u00dfbritannien. Die Ermittler nahmen zwei britische Br\u00fcder, zwei Spanier und einen Italiener fest, gegen die nun Anklage wegen Drogenschmuggels erhoben wurde. Das Flugzeug war am Montag kurz nach der Landung auf dem Farnborough Airport in Hampshire s\u00fcdwestlich von London durchsucht worden.</p> \n <p>Der deutsche Fu\u00dfball und insbesondere der VfL Bochum trauern um Trainer Rolf Schafstall. Nach VfL-Angaben starb der am 22. Februar 1937 in Duisburg geborene Fu\u00dfball-Lehrer am Dienstag im Alter von 80 Jahren. Schaffstall trainierte neben den Bochumern unter anderem den MSV Duisburg, den FC Schalke 04, Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf und Hannover 96.</p> \n <p>F\u00fcr einen grausamen Doppelmord ist ein 20-j\u00e4hriger Mann aus Herne zu lebenslanger Haft verurteilt worden. Das Bochumer Landgericht stellte am Mittwoch zudem die besondere Schwere der Schuld fest. Marcel H. hatte gestanden, im M\u00e4rz 2017 einen neunj\u00e4hrigen Nachbarsjungen und einen 22-j\u00e4hrigen Ex-Schulfreund umgebracht zu haben. </p> \n <p>Hongkong hat den Handel mit Elfenbein verboten. Wie der Legislativrat der chinesischen Sonderverwaltungszone nun entschied, soll das Verbot ab dem Jahr 2021 gelten. Verst\u00f6\u00dfe sollen mit bis zu zehn Jahren Haft bestraft werden. Hongkong folgt damit dem chinesischen Festland, wo der Handel mit Elfenbein bereits seit Ende vergangenen Jahres untersagt ist. Der Elfenbeinmarkt in Hongkong z\u00e4hle zu den gr\u00f6\u00dften der Welt und steht damit in direkter Verbindung zur massenhaften Wilderei auf die Dickh\u00e4uter in Afrika. Die Folge der starken Nachfrage nach Elfenbein ist laut WWF eine dramatische Wildereikrise in Afrika. Jedes Jahr werden nach Angaben der Umweltsch\u00fctzer etwa 20 000 Elefanten illegal get\u00f6tet. </p> \n <p>Der Discounter Aldi Nord will in Berlin rund 2000 Wohnungen bauen. Das k\u00fcndigte die Handelskette an. \"Das ist die Idee: Im Erdgeschoss ein Aldi-Markt und dar\u00fcber Wohnungen\", hie\u00df es. 200 Wohnungen in den Bezirken Neuk\u00f6lln und Lichtenberg w\u00fcrden in K\u00fcrze gebaut, weitere 15 Standorte in der Hauptstadt habe man im Blick.</p> \n <p>Aldi braucht f\u00fcr sein neues Konzept mit gr\u00f6\u00dferem Sortiment sowie frischem Obst, Gem\u00fcse, Fisch und Fleisch gr\u00f6\u00dfere Ladenfl\u00e4chen. Die Verbindung mit Wohnungen d\u00fcrfte es dem Unternehmen erleichtern, Baugenehmigungen zu bekommen. Denn der Senat will die oft nur eingeschossig bebauten Supermarktstandorte st\u00e4rker f\u00fcr Wohnungen nutzen.</p> \n <p>Vor \u00e4hnlichem Hintergrund baut Aldi schon in Hamburg. Ob der Discounter in Berlin auch als Vermieter auftritt oder seine Wohnungen verkaufen will, teilte das Unternehmen nicht mit.</p> \n <p>Frankreich will die D-Day-Str\u00e4nde der alliierten Landung in der Normandie zum Unesco-Weltkulturerbe erkl\u00e4ren lassen. Ein Sprecher der UN-Kulturorganisation best\u00e4tigte den Eingang der franz\u00f6sischen Nominierung. Das Pariser Kulturministerium teilte zur Begr\u00fcndung mit, die Str\u00e4nde tr\u00fcgen die Spuren eines \"Kampfes f\u00fcr die Freiheit und den Frieden\". Am sogenannten D-Day, dem 6. Juni 1944, waren alliierte Truppen im Zweiten Weltkrieg im von Deutschland besetzten Frankreich gelandet.</p> \n <p>Nach einer brutalen Attacke auf einen Teenager sind neun Jugendliche in Neapel gefasst worden. Die Minderj\u00e4hrigen werden verd\u00e4chtigt, einen 15-J\u00e4hrigen am 12. Januar au\u00dferhalb einer Metro-Station grundlos so schlimm zusammengeschlagen zu haben, dass dessen Milz in einer Notoperation entfernt werden musste, wie die Polizei mitteilte. Sie sollen einer sogenannten Baby Gang angeh\u00f6ren. Acht von ihnen kamen laut Polizei in betreute Wohngemeinschaften, ein mutma\u00dflicher Angreifer darf weiterhin bei seiner Familie wohnen. Immer wieder wird die s\u00fcditalienische Stadt - in der auch die Mafia-Organisation Camorra beheimatet ist - von Gewalttaten durch Jugendliche ersch\u00fcttert.</p> \n <p>Bei einem Bootsungl\u00fcck im Mittelmeer k\u00f6nnten am Wochenende bis zu 40 Migranten ertrunken sein. Das haben Aussagen von \u00dcberlebenden, die gestern Abend in Augusta auf Sizilien an Land gegangen waren, ergeben, wie der Sprecher der Internationalen Organisation f\u00fcr Migration, Flavio di Giacomo, heute twitterte.</p> \n <p>Am Samstag waren bei mehreren Rettungseins\u00e4tzen rund 800 Migranten unter anderem von der italienischen K\u00fcstenwache und Hilfsorganisationen gerettet worden. Zwei Leichen wurden geborgen. Weil sie Wasser in den Lungen hatten, mussten 16 Migranten - darunter sechs wiederbelebte Kinder - mit einem Milit\u00e4rhubschrauber ins tunesische Sfax ins Krankenhaus geflogen werden.</p> \n <p>Mehr als zwei Jahre nach einem Selbstmordanschlag auf Deutsche in Istanbul hat ein t\u00fcrkisches Gericht drei Syrer zu lebenslanger Haft verurteilt. Mehrere weitere Beschuldigte wurden in Istanbul freigesprochen. Den Verurteilten wurden unter anderem Mitgliedschaft im IS, vors\u00e4tzliche T\u00f6tung und versuchter Umsturz der verfassungsm\u00e4\u00dfigen Ordnung vorgeworfen. Bei dem Anschlag am 12. Januar 2016 im Istanbuler Altstadtviertel Sultanahmet waren zw\u00f6lf Deutsche get\u00f6tet und 16 Menschen verletzt worden.</p> \n <p>Wer aus medizinischen Gr\u00fcnden Cannabis konsumieren darf, muss seinen Waffenschein abgeben. Das geht aus einem Urteil des Bayerischen Verwaltungsgerichtshofs hervor, das in M\u00fcnchen ver\u00f6ffentlicht wurde. Ein J\u00e4ger aus dem Landkreis Miesbach wollte nicht akzeptieren, dass das Landratsamt ihm die Waffenbesitzkarte und den Jagdschein entzogen hatte - weil er t\u00e4glich mehrfach Cannabisbl\u00fcten inhaliert.</p> \n <p>Das Gericht ist allerdings der Auffassung, dass auch bei medizinisch begr\u00fcndetem regelm\u00e4\u00dfigem Cannabis-Konsum ein verl\u00e4sslicher Umgang mit Waffen und Munition nicht gew\u00e4hrleistet ist. Es</p> \n <p>gebe keine ausreichenden wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisse, wonach sich die Wirkungsweisen des Rauschmittels bei medizinisch \u00fcberwachtem Cannabis-Konsum von denen bei Cannabis-Missbrauch unterscheiden.</p> \n <p>Erstmals \u00fcbernehmen AfD-Abgeordnete den Vorsitz in drei Bundestagsaussch\u00fcssen. Sie erhielten in den Gremien f\u00fcr Haushalt, Recht und Tourismus die n\u00f6tige Mehrheit. Normalerweise m\u00fcssen sich die Vorsitzenden nicht zur Wahl stellen, sondern werden lediglich bestimmt. Da jedoch mehrere Ausschussmitglieder Widerspruch gegen die Nominierten anmeldeten, wurden Wahlen notwendig.</p> \n <p>Der AfD-Abgeordnete und Euro-Gegner Peter Boehringer wurde in offener Wahl mit den Stimmen seiner eigenen Partei und der FDP zum Vorsitzenden des Haushaltsausschusses gew\u00e4hlt. Der Rechtsausschuss w\u00e4hlte den AfD-Abgeordneten Stephan Brandner zu seinem Vorsitzenden. Den Ausschuss f\u00fcr Tourismus leitet k\u00fcnftig der junge AfD-Abgeordnete Sebastian M\u00fcnzenmaier. Union und FDP stimmten bei seiner Wahl mit Ja, die Linke mit Nein. SPD und Gr\u00fcne enthielten sich.</p> \n <p>Ein wegen sexuellen Missbrauchs von Patientinnen angeklagter Arzt hat vor dem Landgericht Konstanz ein Gest\u00e4ndnis abgelegt. Das teilte der Vorsitzende Richter mit. Die \u00d6ffentlichkeit war w\u00e4hrend des Gest\u00e4ndnisses mit Blick auf die Pers\u00f6nlichkeitsrechte des 39-J\u00e4hrigen von der Verhandlung ausgeschlossen worden. Die Staatsanwaltschaft wirft dem fr\u00fcheren Oberarzt und Facharzt f\u00fcr Neurologie vor, an mehreren Patientinnen sexuelle Handlungen vorgenommen zu haben. Dabei soll er die Frauen gebeten haben, sich bis auf die Unterw\u00e4sche zu entkleiden.</p> \n <p>Bei der Untersuchung soll er den Slip der Patientinnen teilweise zur Seite geschoben und die Frauen an und zwischen den Schamlippen ber\u00fchrt haben. Dabei habe der Mann das Beratungs-, Behandlungs- oder Betreuungsverh\u00e4ltnis zu den Frauen ausgenutzt. Betroffen sind laut Anklage f\u00fcnf Patientinnen - die Taten sollen zwischen April 2014 und Februar 2015 geschehen sein.</p> \n <p>In einem Prozess um den verbotenen Salafisten-Verein Millatu Ibrahim hat das Landgericht Hamburg die zw\u00f6lf Angeklagten freigesprochen. \"Die Beweisaufnahme hat Indizien ergeben, aber in keiner Weise Erkenntnisse, die f\u00fcr eine Verurteilung ausreichen\", sagte der Vorsitzende Richter. Auch Staatsanwaltschaft und Verteidigung hatten auf Freispruch pl\u00e4diert.</p> \n <p>Den M\u00e4nnern im Alter von 25 bis 37 Jahren war vorgeworfen worden, Unterst\u00fctzer der seit 2012 verbotenen salafistischen Vereinigung zu sein und sich regelm\u00e4\u00dfig in einer Moschee in Hamburg-Harburg getroffen zu haben. Zudem sollen sie Koranverteilungsst\u00e4nde organisiert haben. Laut Anklage verstie\u00dfen sie damit gegen das Vereinsverbot.</p> \n <p>Knapp zwei Monate nach dem Verschwinden eines 35-J\u00e4hrigen in D\u00fcsseldorf ist die Leiche des Mannes 114 Kilometer entfernt im niederl\u00e4ndischen Nijmegen gefunden worden. Wie der Mann ums Leben gekommen ist, sei noch unklar, teilte die Polizei nun mit. Vermutlich ist er in den Rhein gefallen und mit dem Fluss bis in die Niederlande getrieben. Der Oberhausener war seit dem 3. Dezember 2017 als vermisst gemeldet, nachdem er nach einer Weihnachtsfeier mit einem Arbeitskollegen in der D\u00fcsseldorfer Altstadt alleine nach Hause gegangen war. Dass eine Wasserleiche so weit treibe, sei nicht ungew\u00f6hnlich, sagt der Pressesprecher der Wasserschutzpolizei Duisburg, Ramon van der Maat.</p> \n <p>Der Bau der umstrittenen Ostseepipeline Nord Stream 2 hat eine weitere H\u00fcrde genommen. Das Bergamt Stralsund, das f\u00fcr die Genehmigung in den deutschen K\u00fcstengew\u00e4ssern zust\u00e4ndig ist, gab heute gr\u00fcnes Licht f\u00fcr den Bau. Nach der Pr\u00fcfung aller eingereichten Unterlagen sowie der Abw\u00e4gung der dazu eingegangenen Einwendungen habe die Beh\u00f6rde den Bau und Betrieb der Pipeline \u00fcber 55 Kilometer im deutschen K\u00fcstenmeer f\u00fcr zul\u00e4ssig erkl\u00e4rt, teilte das Energieministerium des Landes Mecklenburg-Vorpommern mit.</p> \n <p>Wegen der zunehmenden Gewalt in Mexiko hat die Regierung mehr als 5000 zus\u00e4tzliche Sicherheitskr\u00e4fte in mehrere Urlaubsorte und andere Gebiete des Landes entsandt. Die Ma\u00dfnahme solle \"diese wachsende Gewalt schnell verringern\", erkl\u00e4rte der mexikanische Innenminister Alfonso Navarrete in Mexiko-Stadt. Verst\u00e4rkt wurden die Sicherheitskr\u00e4fte vor allem im Ferienort Canc\u00fan sowie in der Region Baja California Sur mit den Badeorten Los Cabos und La Paz geschickt.</p> \n <p>Die Linke beantragt im Haushaltsausschuss des Bundestags eine Abstimmung \u00fcber den AfD-Kandidaten f\u00fcr den Vorsitz des Gremiums. Das k\u00fcndigte die Linken-Haush\u00e4lterin Gesine L\u00f6tzsch vor Beginn der konstituierenden Ausschusssitzung an. Der AfD-Kandidat Peter Boehringer habe sich in der Vergangenheit rassistisch und frauenfeindlich ge\u00e4u\u00dfert, begr\u00fcndete L\u00f6tzsch den Schritt.</p> \n <p>Normalerweise werden die Vorsitzenden der Bundestagsaussch\u00fcsse nicht gew\u00e4hlt, sondern nur bestimmt. Wenn aber eine andere Fraktion Widerspruch gegen einen Kandidaten einlegt, muss es stattdessen eine Wahl des Vorsitzenden geben.</p> \n <p>Zwei Tote hat die Polizei in Darmstadt nahe dem Hauptbahnhof gefunden. Die Polizei geht von einem Gewaltverbrechen aus. Zeugen hatten von Sch\u00fcssen und einem brennenden Auto berichtet und die Beh\u00f6rden alarmiert, wie eine Polizeisprecherin mitteilte. Die Feuerwehr l\u00f6schte am Tatort ein brennendes Auto. Zuvor hatte das \"Darmst\u00e4dter Echo\" dar\u00fcber berichtet. </p> \n <p>In dem Auto wurde laut Polizei ein toter Mann aufgefunden, die Leiche einer Frau wurde in der N\u00e4he entdeckt. Das Fahrzeug war auf einem Parkplatz in einem Hof abgestellt. Es handele sich m\u00f6glicherweise um ein T\u00f6tungsdelikt und einen Suizid.</p> \n <p>In \u00d6sterreich soll die Burschenschaft Germania nach dem Skandal um ein Liederbuch mit antisemitischen Texten aufgel\u00f6st werden. Ein entsprechendes Verfahren solle eingeleitet werden, sagte Bundeskanzler Sebastian Kurz (\u00d6VP).</p> \n <p>Unterdessen wurde bekannt, dass einer der vier Verd\u00e4chtigen in der Aff\u00e4re ein Mitglied der Sozialdemokraten war. Die SP\u00d6 schloss den Mann, der das 1997 neu aufgelegte Liederbuch illustriert haben soll, sofort aus der Partei aus.</p> \n <p>Der Vizekanzler und FP\u00d6-Chef Heinz-Christian Strache sieht dagegen weiter keinen Grund, den FP\u00d6-Spitzenpolitiker Udo Landbauer aus der Partei zu verbannen. Der 31-J\u00e4hrige habe erkl\u00e4rt, dass er den Text nicht gekannt habe. Landbauer war Vizepr\u00e4sident der Burschenschaft.</p> \n <p>Apple ist wegen der Leistungsdrosselung bei \u00e4lteren iPhone-Modellen jetzt auch im Visier der US-Beh\u00f6rden. Das Justizministerium und die B\u00f6rsenaufsicht SEC pr\u00fcfen laut der Nachrichtenagentur Bloomberg, ob Apple seine Kunden mit Einf\u00fchrung dieser Drosselung sofort h\u00e4tte informieren m\u00fcssen - und nicht erst, nachdem Kunden sich dar\u00fcber beschwert hatten. Apple hatte im Dezember einger\u00e4umt, dass \u00e4ltere Smartphones per Software-Update verlangsamt werden, um zu verhindern, dass sie sich pl\u00f6tzlich ausschalten.</p> \n <p>Eingef\u00fchrt hatte der Technologiekonzern dieses Update bereits vor einem Jahr. Mittlerweile hat sich Apple bei den Kunden daf\u00fcr entschuldigt, den Akkuwechsel deutlich verbilligt und angek\u00fcndigt, dass die Nutzer bald selbst \u00fcber die - empfohlene - Leistungsdrosselung entscheiden k\u00f6nnen. Bloomberg berichtete unter Berufung auf informierte Kreise, die sp\u00e4te Information der Kunden k\u00f6nnte einen Gesetzesversto\u00df darstellen.</p> \n <p>Die Zahl der Arbeitslosen in Deutschland ist im Januar im Vergleich zum Vormonat um 185.000 auf 2,57 Millionen gestiegen. Gegen\u00fcber dem Vorjahr ging die Zahl der Erwerbslosen um 207.000 zur\u00fcck, wie die Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Arbeit in N\u00fcrnberg mitteilte. Die Arbeitslosenquote stieg um 0,5 Punkte auf 5,8 Prozent.</p> \n <p>Bei einem r\u00e4tselhaften Schusswechsel im Urwald von Kambodscha sind drei M\u00e4nner get\u00f6tet worden. Die beiden Beamten und ein Umweltsch\u00fctzer waren auf einem Kontrollgang im abgelegenen Naturreservat Keo Seima an der Grenze zu Vietnam, als es zu einem Feuergefecht mit vermeintlichen Grenzbeamten kam, wie die Zeitung \"Phnom Penh Post\" berichtete. Spekuliert wurde dar\u00fcber, dass die drei M\u00e4nner Holzdiebe auf frischer Tat ertappten. In dem s\u00fcdostasiatischen Staat wird seit vielen Jahren Tropenholz in gro\u00dfem Stil abgeholzt.</p> \n <p>Ein schweres Erdbeben hat den Nordosten Afghanistans ersch\u00fcttert. Nach Angaben der US-Erdbebenwarte USGS hatte das Beben eine St\u00e4rke von 6,1, sein Zentrum lag nahe der Grenze zu Tadschikistan im Hindukusch-Gebirge in einer Tiefe von 191 Kilometern. Die Ersch\u00fctterungen waren auch in der pakistanischen Hauptstadt Islamabad und in der indischen Hauptstadt Neu Delhi zu sp\u00fcren.</p> \n <p>In Pakistan kam ein Baby ums Leben, als im Haus seiner Familie in der s\u00fcdwestlichen Provinz Baluchistan das Dach einst\u00fcrzte. Wie ein Beh\u00f6rdenvertreter mitteilte, wurden neun weitere Familienmitglieder verletzt. \u00dcber weitere Opfer oder Sch\u00e4den durch das Erdbeben war zun\u00e4chst nichts bekannt.</p> \n <p>Im US-Bundesstaat Texas ist ein wegen Mordes an seiner Frau und seiner Freundin verurteilter H\u00e4ftling hingerichtet worden. Der 64-j\u00e4hrige William Rayford erhielt im Gef\u00e4ngnis von Huntsville eine t\u00f6dliche Injektion und wurde gestern Abend f\u00fcr tot erkl\u00e4rt, wie die Strafvollzugsbeh\u00f6rde mitteilte. Zuvor hatte der Oberste Gerichtshof der USA einen letzten Einspruch gegen die Vollstreckung des Todesurteils abgelehnt.</p> \n <p>Der Afroamerikaner Rayford wurde wegen der Ermordung seiner Freundin im Jahr 1999 zum Tode verurteilt. Zuvor war er bereits wegen der Ermordung seiner Ehefrau im Jahr 1986 zu 23 Jahren Gef\u00e4ngnis verurteilt worden. Er sa\u00df acht Jahre der Haftstrafe ab und war zum Zeitpunkt des zweiten Mordes auf Bew\u00e4hrung frei.</p> \n <p>Der Juso-Vorsitzende Kevin K\u00fchnert hat die Einigung von SPD und Union zum Familiennachzug f\u00fcr Fl\u00fcchtlinge kritisiert. Auf dem SPD-Parteitag sei eine \"weitergehende H\u00e4rtefallregelung\" gefordert worden, sagte K\u00fchnert im Deutschlandfunk. \"Dieser Auftrag ist nicht erf\u00fcllt worden.\"</p> \n <p>Union und SPD hatten sich am Dienstag darauf verst\u00e4ndigt, die Aussetzung des Nachzugs f\u00fcr Fl\u00fcchtlinge mit eingeschr\u00e4nktem Schutzstatus bis Ende Juli zu verl\u00e4ngern. Danach soll ein monatliches Kontingent von tausend Menschen f\u00fcr den Nachzug von Familienmitgliedern gelten. Daneben bleibt die bisherige H\u00e4rtefallregelung bestehen.</p> \n <p>Franz\u00f6sische und spanische Rettungskr\u00e4fte suchen am Mittwoch weiter nach Pierre Agnes, dem Chef der Modemarke Quiksilver. Nach einem Angelausflug auf dem Atlantik war Agnes' Boot am Dienstag an den Strand von Hossegor im S\u00fcdwesten Frankreichs gesp\u00fclt worden, wie die \u00f6rtliche Marinepr\u00e4fektur mitteilte.</p> \n <p>Der 54-j\u00e4hrige Agnes hatte um 7.30 Uhr gestern Morgen auf seinem Elf-Meter-Boot Mascaret III abgelegt, wie \u00f6rtliche Medien unter Berufung auf die Beh\u00f6rden berichteten. Sp\u00e4ter funkte er, dass er wegen Nebel sp\u00e4ter als geplant zur\u00fcckkehre, wie die franz\u00f6sische Nachrichtenagentur AFP meldete. Um 9.17 Uhr wurde das Boot ohne Agnes am Strand gefunden. Den Dienstag \u00fcber suchten Rettungskr\u00e4fte aus Frankreich und Spanien nach ihm. Die Suche blieb zun\u00e4chst erfolglos.</p> \n <p>Auf einer Auktion in Australien sind versehentlich Regierungspapiere versteigert worden, die zum Teil als \"streng geheim\" deklariert waren. Die Dokumente stammen nach einem Bericht des Fernsehsenders ABC vom Mittwoch von insgesamt f\u00fcnf verschiedenen fr\u00fcheren Regierungen. Der amtierende Premierminister Malcolm Turnbull gab eine Untersuchung in Auftrag, wie sie an die \u00d6ffentlichkeit gelangen konnten. Mehrere Dokumente tragen noch den Stempel \"Top Secret\".</p> \n <p>Die Papiere wurden in \u00e4lteren B\u00fcrom\u00f6beln aus Regierungsbestand entdeckt, die k\u00fcrzlich bei einer Auktion in der Hauptstadt Canberra versteigert wurden. Dem TV-Bericht zufolge waren die M\u00f6bel nicht allzu teuer, weil sie abgeschlossen und die Schl\u00fcssel nicht mehr zu finden waren. Dann sei es aber doch jemandem gelungen, die Schl\u00f6sser zu knacken. Der Sender konnte die Papiere nach eigenen Angaben \u00fcber mehrere Tage sichten. </p> \n <p>Die radikalislamischen Taliban bedrohen einer Recherche der BBC zufolge rund 70 Prozent Afghanistans - bedeutend mehr als zuvor gesch\u00e4tzt. In der nun ver\u00f6ffentlichten Zusammenfassung der im Herbst 2017 \u00fcber mehrere Monate gesammelten Daten hei\u00dft es, dass die Islamisten die volle Kontrolle \u00fcber 14 Bezirke (vier Prozent des Landes) und eine aktive Pr\u00e4senz in weiteren 263 Bezirken (66 Prozent des Landes) h\u00e4tten.</p> \n <p>Damit leben \"um die 15 Millionen Afghanen - die H\u00e4lfte der Bev\u00f6lkerung - in Gegenden, die entweder von den Taliban kontrolliert werden oder in denen die Taliban offen pr\u00e4sent sind und regelm\u00e4\u00dfig Angriffe ver\u00fcben\", berichtete die <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42863116\">BBC</a>. Nach eigenen Angaben hat die BBC f\u00fcr die Studie zwischen August und November mehr als 1200 Menschen aus allen Bezirken befragt.</p> \n <p>In Indonesien hat eine Familie zwei Jahre lang mit der Leiche des verstorbenen Vaters im Haus gelebt. Die sterblichen \u00dcberreste des 84-J\u00e4hrigen wurden von einem Sozialarbeiter entdeckt, der der Familie in der Gemeinde Cimahi auf der Insel Java einen Besuch abstatten wollte. Der Tote war nach Polizeiangaben lediglich in eine Decke eingeh\u00fcllt. Bei einer gr\u00fcndlicheren Untersuchung wurde dann noch eine zweite Leiche gefunden: offenbar die \u00e4lteste Tochter des Paars, eine etwa 50 Jahre alte Frau.</p> \n <p>Auf der Pazifikinsel Nauru - einem der kleinsten Staaten der Welt - haben die etwa 10.000 Bewohner nach fast drei Jahren wieder Zugang zu Facebook. Pr\u00e4sident Baron Waqa k\u00fcndigte an, die staatliche Blockade des sozialen Netzwerks mit sofortiger Wirkung aufzuheben. Die Blockade hatte seit Mai 2015 gegolten. Waqa begr\u00fcndete dies damals damit, dass das Land vor \"Kriminellen und sexuell Perversen\" gesch\u00fctzt werden m\u00fcsse.</p> \n <p>S\u00fcden von Mexiko haben die Ermittler sieben zerst\u00fcckelte Leichen entdeckt. Die menschlichen \u00dcberreste seien in 15 Plastikt\u00fcten nahe der Ortschaft Chilapa in der Unruheprovinz Guerrero entdeckt worden, teilten die \u00f6rtlichen Sicherheitsbeh\u00f6rden gestern mit. Unter den Opfern war demnach mindestens eine Frau.</p> \n <p>Mexiko wird derzeit von einer beispiellosen Gewaltwelle \u00fcberrollt. Mit 29.168 T\u00f6tungsdelikten war das vergangene Jahr das schlimmste in der j\u00fcngeren Geschichte des Landes. Rund 30.000 Menschen gelten au\u00dferdem als verschwunden.</p> \n <p>Die Regierung Perus hat eine st\u00e4rkere \u00dcberwachung der zum Weltkulturerbe z\u00e4hlenden Nazca-Linien angeordnet, nachdem ein Lastwagen \u00fcber die arch\u00e4ologische St\u00e4tte gefahren war. Das 450 Quadratkilometer gro\u00dfe Areal solle k\u00fcnftig auch nachts und mit Drohnen \u00fcberwacht werden, teilte das Kulturministerium am Dienstag (Ortszeit) mit. Am Samstag hatte ein Lastwagenfahrer Reifenspuren auf den 2000 Jahre alten Geoglyphen hinterlassen. Er wurde festgenommen und angeklagt.</p> \n <p>Der Lastwagen habe auf einer Strecke von rund hundert Metern drei Linien besch\u00e4digt, die Teil eines Eidechsenbildes seien, berichtete die Zeitung \"El Comercio\". Der Fahrer gab an, er sei in das gesch\u00fctzte Gebiet eingedrungen, um einen Reifen zu wechseln.</p> \n <p>Beim Absturz eines Hubschraubers in einem Wohngebiet im kalifornischen Newport Beach sind drei Menschen get\u00f6tet worden. Nach Mitteilung der Polizei befanden sich vier Personen an Bord des Helikopters. F\u00fcnf Menschen seien von dem Unfall betroffen gewesen, darunter auch einer in dem Wohngebiet. Der Absturz ereignete sich in einer Reihenhaussiedlung in der N\u00e4he des John-Wayne-Flughafens, wie die Flughafenverwaltung mitteilte. In Fernsehbildern waren Teile des zertr\u00fcmmerten Hubschraubers im Vorgarten und auf dem Dach eines Hauses zu sehen.</p> \n <p>Union und SPD haben bei ihren Koalitionsverhandlungen eine Einigung \u00fcber Verbesserungen in der Pflege erreicht. K\u00fcnftig soll es in der Branche fl\u00e4chendeckende Tarifvertr\u00e4ge geben, wie die rheinland-pf\u00e4lzische Ministerpr\u00e4sidentin Malu Dreyer (SPD) gestern Abend in Berlin sagte. Daf\u00fcr solle es k\u00fcnftig schneller m\u00f6glich sein, einen Tarifvertrag f\u00fcr allgemeinverbindlich zu erkl\u00e4ren.</p> \n <p>Es solle au\u00dferdem Erleichterungen bei der Beantragung von Leistungen geben, etwa auch beim \"pr\u00e4ventiven Hausbesuch\". Von ihm sollen \u00e4ltere Menschen profitieren, die noch nicht pflegebed\u00fcrftig sind.</p> \n <p>Der Mitarbeiter, der am 13. Januar die Bev\u00f6lkerung auf Hawaii mit einem falschen Raketenalarm in Angst und Schrecken versetzte, glaubte wirklich an einen unmittelbar bevorstehenden Angriff. Das geht der <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/\">\"Washington Post\"</a> zufolge aus einem vorl\u00e4ufigen Untersuchungsbericht der f\u00fcr Kommunikationswege zust\u00e4ndigen US-Bundesbeh\u00f6rde FCC hervor. Am Dienstag (Ortszeit) trat ein f\u00fchrendes Mitglied des hawaiianischen Katastrophenschutzes zur\u00fcck.</p> \n <p>Der Attent\u00e4ter des Lieferwagen-Anschlags auf Muslime in London wollte nach eigenen Angaben den britischen Labour-Chef Jeremy Corbyn und den Londoner B\u00fcrgermeister Sadiq Khan t\u00f6ten. Dies sagte der 48-j\u00e4hrige Darren Osborne gestern vor einem Gericht in London aus. Demnach wollte er die beiden Politiker bei einem pro-pal\u00e4stinensischen Marsch treffen, zu dem Corbyn erwartet wurde.</p> \n <p>Aufgrund zahlreicher Stra\u00dfensperrungen wegen der Veranstaltung soll der Vater von vier Kindern aus dem walisischen Cardiff dann am 19. Juni in London mit einem Lieferwagen in eine Gruppe von Muslimen gerast sein, die vom Abendgebet in der Finsbury-Park-Moschee kamen. Ein Mann starb, elf weitere Menschen wurden verletzt. Augenzeugen zufolge rief der Fahrer, er wolle \"alle Muslime t\u00f6ten\".</p> \n</div>",
        "text": "Die wichtigsten Meldungen im Kurz-\u00dcberblick: Die Nachrichten des Tages im stern-Newsticker: Das zum Islam konvertierte fr\u00fchere Mitglied des AfD-Landesvorstandes in Brandenburg, Arthur Wagner, will in der rechtspopulistischen Partei bleiben. Er habe zwar seine Posten im Landesvorstand und im Kreisvorstand im Havelland niedergelegt, wolle aber normales Mitglied bleiben, sagte der 48-J\u00e4hrige in Potsdam. \"Ich werde der AfD immer treu bleiben\", sagte er. Er wolle zwischen dem Islam und nationalkonservativen Deutschen vermitteln, sagte Wagner. Man m\u00fcsse Br\u00fccken bauen. Er war nach eigenen Angaben in den 1990er Jahren als Russlanddeutscher nach Deutschland gekommen. Seine Pressekonferenz war auch von Sprachproblemen gepr\u00e4gt. Er wolle jetzt besser deutsch lernen und Islamwissenschaften in einem Fernstudiengang studieren, sagte Wagner. Ein Zug mit Parlamentariern der US-Republikaner ist mit einem Lkw kollidiert. Das Wei\u00dfe Haus teilte mit, es habe einen Toten und einen Schwerverletzten gegeben, aber nicht unter den Mitgliedern von Repr\u00e4sentantenhaus und Senat. Von den Parlamentariern sei niemand \"schwer verletzt\" worden, erkl\u00e4rte die Sprecherin des Wei\u00dfen Hauses, Sarah Sanders. Ob es \u00fcberhaupt Verletzte unter den Kongressmitgliedern gab, war zun\u00e4chst unklar. Die Parlamentarier befanden sich auf dem Weg zu einer Klausurtagung in White Sulphur Springs im Bundesstaat West Virginia, als der Zug mit einem M\u00fcllwagen zusammenprallte. Der Abgeordnete Bradley Byrne schrieb kurz nach dem Vorfall im Internetdienst Twitter, Sicherheitspersonal und \u00c4rzte bef\u00e4nden sich an Bord des Zuges, \"um den Ort abzusichern und Verletzte zu behandeln\". Er teilte jedoch nicht mit, ob es sich bei den Verletzten um Kongressmitglieder handelte. Die Schweiz will mit neuer Dynamik wieder Bewegung in die stockenden Verhandlungen mit der EU \u00fcber engere Beziehungen bringen. Die Eidgenossenschaft habe neue Ideen und wolle das Thema k\u00fcnftig viel offensiver angehen, sagte Au\u00dfenminister Ignazio Cassis in Bern. \"Wir sind bereit, vorw\u00e4rts zu gehen.\" Die wirtschaftlichen, politischen und kulturellen Verflechtungen seien tief. \"Wir sind ein Teil Europas, auch wenn wir nicht zur EU geh\u00f6ren.\" Es bestehe ein Zeitfenster von etwa zehn Monaten, um die Beziehungen zwischen der EU und der Schweiz neu zu regeln. 2019 sei keine Bewegung zu erwarten, war sich Cassis sicher. Dann kommt es voraussichtlich zum Brexit, das Europ\u00e4ische Parlament sowie der Schweizer Nationalrat werden gew\u00e4hlt. Die Schweiz strebt laut Cassis den \"bestm\u00f6glichen Marktzugang und die gr\u00f6\u00dftm\u00f6gliche Eigenst\u00e4ndigkeit\" an. Das Land hat sich zwar gegen eine EU-Mitgliedschaft entschieden, hat aber \u00fcber bilaterale Vertr\u00e4ge Zugang zum EU-Binnenmarkt. Ein Rahmenabkommen soll diese Beziehung neu regeln. Die Verhandlungen dauern bereits seit rund vier Jahren. Am Landgericht T\u00fcbingen hat der Prozess gegen einen jungen Mann wegen zwei Vergewaltigungen und zwei versuchten Vergewaltigungen begonnen. Er soll im Mai und Oktober 2015 drei Frauen auf ihrem Heimweg von Partys abgepasst und angegriffen haben, hei\u00dft es in der Anklage. Au\u00dferdem soll er im Februar 2017 eine behinderte Frau unter einem Vorwand zu sich eingeladen und vergewaltigt haben. Zum Prozessauftakt wollte der nach eigenen Angaben 22-j\u00e4hrige Mann zu mindestens einer Tat aussagen. Die \u00d6ffentlichkeit wurde aber ausgeschlossen, weil der Mann zum Tatzeitpunkt m\u00f6glicherweise noch Heranwachsender war. Der Angeklagte stammt aus Gambia und war vor drei Jahren nach Deutschland gekommen. Laut Staatsanwaltschaft hat er verschiedene Geburtsdaten angegeben. Am Gerichtsverfahren ist ein Sachverst\u00e4ndiger zur Frage der Alterfeststellung beteiligt. Das Urteil wird f\u00fcr 27. M\u00e4rz erwartet. Nach den j\u00fcngsten R\u00fcckschl\u00e4gen hat der katalanische Separatisten-Chef Carles Puigdemont in einer privaten Mitteilung das Ende der Unabh\u00e4ngigkeitsbewegung in der spanischen Konfliktregion einger\u00e4umt. Die Zentralregierung in Madrid habe gewonnen, schrieb Puigdemont seinem politischen Mitstreiter Toni Com\u00edn per Kurzmitteilungsdienst Signal. Die Zeilen wurden vom TV-Sender \"Telecinco\" enth\u00fcllt. Ein Journalist habe unbemerkt das Display des Handys von Com\u00edn fotografiert, als er seine Mitteilungen gelesen habe, berichtete der Sender. Puigdemont blieb nichts anderes \u00fcbrig, als die Echtheit der \"abgefangenen\" Botschaften zu best\u00e4tigen. Der nach seiner Absetzung als katalanischer Regionalpr\u00e4sident seit Ende Oktober in Belgien im Exil lebende 55-J\u00e4hrige bestritt allerdings, dass er aufgibt. \"Wir machen weiter!\", beteuerte er auf Twitter. Nach dem Erfolg der Separatisten bei der Neuwahl im Dezember war Puigdemont vom katalanischen Parlamentspr\u00e4sidenten Roger Torrent zum Kandidaten ernannt worden. Am Dienstag erlitt er aber einen schweren R\u00fcckschlag: Die Debatte im Regionalparlament in Barcelona \u00fcber seine Wiederwahl wurde von Torrent auf Anordnung des Verfassungsgerichts in Madrid bis auf Weiteres vertagt. Die Zentrale Stelle zur Aufkl\u00e4rung nationalsozialistischer Verbrechen in Ludwigsburg hat weitere mutma\u00dfliche NS-Verbrecher ausfindig gemacht. Die Staatsanwaltschaft Erfurt habe auf Grundlage ihrer Recherchen die Ermittlungen gegen f\u00fcnf ehemalige SS-Wachm\u00e4nner des Konzentrationslagers Buchenwald bei Weimar aufgenommen, sagte ein Sprecher der Staatsanwaltschaft auf Anfrage. Die Vorw\u00fcrfe lauteten auf Beihilfe zum Mord. Die M\u00e4nner seien heute zwischen 92 und 96 Jahre alt. Zuvor hatte die Tageszeitung \"taz\" \u00fcber die Ermittlungen berichtet. Die Beschuldigten leben in Th\u00fcringen, Berlin, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Bayern und im Rheinland, wie der Leiter der Zentralen Stelle zur Aufkl\u00e4rung nationalsozialistischer Verbrechen, Jens Rommel, am Mittwoch sagte. Sie sind demnach zwischen Juni 1921 und November 1925 geboren. Rommel sagte, vier der der Beschuldigten seien in der \"Sp\u00e4tphase\" von Buchenwald dort eingesetzt worden, also 1944/45. Saisonbedingt ist die Zahl der Arbeitslosen in Deutschland im Januar gestiegen - im Vergleich zum Vormonat um 185.000 auf 2,57 Millionen. Das ist jedoch der niedrigste Wert in diesem Monat seit mehr als 25 Jahren. Der Anstieg fiel nach Angaben der Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Arbeit (BA) in N\u00fcrnberg auch geringer aus als \u00fcblich. Gegen\u00fcber dem Vorjahr ging die Zahl der Erwerbslosen um 207.000 zur\u00fcck, wie die BA mitteilte. Die Arbeitslosenquote stieg um 0,5 Punkte auf 5,8 Prozent. Die Bundesagentur f\u00fchrt die Zunahme auf die Winterpause zur\u00fcck. Ein Karnevalist hat Kanzlerin Angela Merkel und SPD-Chef Martin Schulz Kost\u00fcmempfehlungen gegeben. Merkel k\u00f6nne am besten als Elbin gehen, Schulz als Clown, sagte Klaus-Ludwig Fess, Pr\u00e4sident des Bundes Deutscher Karneval, der \"Frankfurter Rundschau\". Merkel \"sollte ein elbenhaftes Kost\u00fcm tragen - wie bei \"Der Herr der Ringe\"\", meinte Fess. Denn die CDU-Chefin sei sehr staatsm\u00e4nnisch und strahle Ruhe aus. Schulz hingegen sei \"irgendwie eine tragikomische Figur\". Allerdings: \"Ein Clown steht auch f\u00fcr Humor, Frohsinn, Heiterkeit und bringt Menschen zum Lachen. Und das ist in diesen Zeiten doch auch nicht verkehrt.\" In Bayern ist ein sogenannter Reichsb\u00fcrger wegen Bedrohung von Beh\u00f6rdenmitarbeitern und weiterer Straftaten zu einer Gef\u00e4ngnisstrafe von 15 Monaten ohne Bew\u00e4hrung verurteilt worden. Der 51-J\u00e4hrige aus dem schw\u00e4bischen Donauw\u00f6rth hatte laut Anklage unter anderem den Mitarbeitern der Generalstaatsanwaltschaft in M\u00fcnchen in einem Schreiben mit der Hinrichtung gedroht. Der Angeklagte habe die Vorw\u00fcrfe nicht bestritten, teilte das Amtsgericht Aichach mit. Er habe jedoch klar gemacht, dass er die Justiz nicht anerkenne. \"Reichsb\u00fcrger\" lehnen die Bundesrepublik als Staat ab und behaupten, das Deutsche Reich bestehe fort. Seit Jahren besch\u00e4ftigen sie die deutschen Gerichte. Die Prozesse finden dabei h\u00e4ufig mit erh\u00f6hten Sicherheitsvorkehrungen statt. Nach dem Angriff eines aggressiven Gockels im bayerischen Landkreis Ebersberg m\u00fcssen die Besitzer des Tieres einem Bauaufseher rund 37.500 Euro Schmerzensgeld und Schadenersatz zahlen. Der Streit ging vor dem Oberlandesgericht M\u00fcnchen in die zweite Instanz und endete mit einem entsprechenden Vergleich. Der Mann war mit Stra\u00dfenbauarbeiten in der N\u00e4he des Grundst\u00fccks der Beklagten im Landkreis Ebersberg besch\u00e4ftigt. Er sei von dem Hahn angegriffen worden und beim Ausweichversuch r\u00fcckw\u00e4rts \u00fcber die Stra\u00dfenkante gestolpert, sagte er sp\u00e4ter zu dem Vorfall. Dabei habe er sich einen Wirbel gebrochen. Frankreichs Pr\u00e4sident Emmanuel Macron hat die T\u00fcrkei im Hinblick auf ihre Milit\u00e4roffensive in Syrien vor einer \"Invasion\" gewarnt. Sollte der Einsatz eine andere Wendung nehmen als eine Aktion gegen Terror und sich als Invasion herausstellen, \"dann w\u00fcrde diese Operation f\u00fcr uns ein echtes Problem darstellen\", sagte er der Zeitung \"Le Figaro\". Die T\u00fcrkei geht in der Region Afrin in Nordwestsyrien seit dem 20. Januar gegen die Kurdenmiliz YPG vor. Macron sprach sich wegen der Offensive f\u00fcr Gespr\u00e4che und Entscheidungen zwischen Europ\u00e4ern und \"breiter unter Verb\u00fcndeten\" aus. \"Denn sie ver\u00e4ndert die Natur dieses t\u00fcrkischen Eindringens, und deshalb werde ich in den kommenden Tagen erneut mit (dem t\u00fcrkischen Pr\u00e4sidenten Recep Tayyip) Erdogan sprechen.\" Laut dem Blatt gab Macron das Interview nach einem Abendessen der armenischen Gemeinschaft Frankreichs in Paris. Der t\u00fcrkische Ministerpr\u00e4sident Binali Yildirim entgegnete: \"Die ganze Welt wei\u00df und sollte wissen, dass die T\u00fcrkei keinesfalls mit einer Logik der Besatzung vorgeht.\" Wenn Frankreich das so verstehe, m\u00fcsse man seine Aktivit\u00e4ten in Syrien genauso bewerten. Nach scharfer Kritik hat die ukrainische Regierung die vier EU-Staaten Malta, Estland, Lettland und Ungarn wieder von einer schwarzen Liste f\u00fcr Steueroasen gestrichen. Dies teilte Regierungschef Wladimir Groisman der staatlichen Agentur Ukrinform zufolge mit. Von der erst am 1. Januar ver\u00f6ffentlichten Liste wurde demnach auch der Kaukasusstaat Georgien gestrichen. Die estnische Regierung begr\u00fc\u00dfte den Schritt. \"Ich bin froh, dass die ukrainischen Kollegen schnell gehandelt haben\", sagte Regierungschef J\u00fcri Ratas einer Mitteilung der Staatskanzlei in Tallinn zufolge. Angesichts der Emp\u00f6rung \u00fcber Diesel-Abgastests mit Affen haben die beteiligten deutschen Autohersteller der Bundesregierung Konsequenzen zugesichert. Vertreter von VW, Daimler und BMW h\u00e4tten eigene Studien mit Forschungen an Lebewesen zuk\u00fcnftig ausgeschlossen, teilte das Verkehrsministerium nach einer Sondersitzung seiner Abgas-Untersuchungskommission mit. Die Unternehmen wollten sich direkt oder indirekt nur noch an Studien beteiligen, bei denen die Einhaltung geltenden deutschen Rechts und deutscher Ethikgrunds\u00e4tze gew\u00e4hrleistet sei. Die Hersteller wollten zudem pr\u00fcfen, ob es noch andere Vereine wie die EUGT gibt. Der deutsche Europaabgeordnete Udo Bullmann \u00fcbernimmt f\u00fcr etwa einen Monat den Fraktionsvorsitz der europ\u00e4ischen Sozialdemokraten. Das k\u00fcndigte der bisherige Fraktionschef Gianni Pittella in Br\u00fcssel an. Pittella kandidiert f\u00fcr die italienischen Parlamentswahlen am 4. M\u00e4rz. Er will sein Amt w\u00e4hrend des Wahlkampfes ruhen lassen. Sollte er gew\u00e4hlt werden, werde er am 7. M\u00e4rz vor dem EU-Parlament seinen R\u00fccktritt erkl\u00e4ren, sagte der Italiener vor Journalisten. In diesem Fall werde anschlie\u00dfend die Wahl seines Nachfolgers vorbereitet. Udo Bullmann ist im Europaparlament Vize-Fraktionschef der europ\u00e4ischen Sozialdemokraten. Der 61-J\u00e4hrige aus dem hessischen Gie\u00dfen wird in Medienberichten bereits als dauerhafter Nachfolger Pittellas gehandelt. Die iranische Staatsanwaltschaft will hart gegen die wachsende Zahl der \"Anti-Kopftuch-Demonstrantinnen\" durchgreifen. \"Das Kopftuch in der \u00d6ffentlichkeit abzunehmen ist gegen das Gesetz und die islamische Pflicht und daher eine eindeutige Straftat\", sagte Teherans Staatsanwalt Abbas Dschafar Dolatabadi. Er best\u00e4tigte, dass mindestens eine Demonstrantin festgenommen und eingesperrt worden sei. Die Staatsanwaltschaft werde diesbez\u00fcglich \"ihre Pflicht konsequent erf\u00fcllen\", warnte Dolatabadi nach Angaben der Nachrichtenagentur Ilna. Als Protest gegen den Kopftuchzwang im Iran nehmen immer wieder Frauen auf den Stra\u00dfen ihre Kopft\u00fccher ab und h\u00e4ngen sie als Fahne an einen Stock. Bis jetzt sollen ein Dutzend Frauen an der Aktion teilgenommen haben. F\u00fcr den Staat werden die \"Anti-Kopftuch-Proteste\" in Teheran und anderen St\u00e4dten allm\u00e4hlich zu einem ernsten Problem. Die Schweizer Luftwaffe \u00fcberpr\u00fcft vorsorglich ihre 30 Kampfflugzeuge vom Typ F/A-18C Hornet auf Sch\u00e4den an der Landeklappe. Bei einem Kontrollflug sei ein Bruch in einem Befestigungsscharnier der Landeklappe entdeckt worden, teilte die Regierung mit. Als Vorsichtsma\u00dfnahme f\u00fcr die Flugt\u00fcchtigkeit und -sicherheit w\u00fcrden nun die Befestigungsscharniere dieses Jets vor dem n\u00e4chsten Flug einer Risspr\u00fcfung unterzogen. Bis Donnerstagabend sollen alle Hornet \u00fcberpr\u00fcft sein. \"Solange ein Flugzeug nicht \u00fcberpr\u00fcft ist, solange startet es nicht\", sagte ein Sprecher. Die f\u00fcr den Luftpolizeidienst eingesetzten Jets w\u00fcrden vorrangig \u00fcberpr\u00fcft. Damit werde die Interventionsf\u00e4higkeit der Luftwaffe, die auch \u00fcber Maschinen vom Typ Tiger verf\u00fcge, sichergestellt. F\u00fcnf Jugendliche und ein junger Mann sind in Thailand wegen Majest\u00e4tsbeleidigung zu mehrj\u00e4hrigen Gef\u00e4ngnisstrafen verurteilt worden. Die sechs Angeklagten wurden nach Angaben ihrer Anw\u00e4lte schuldig gesprochen, Portr\u00e4ts von Mitgliedern des thail\u00e4ndischen K\u00f6nigshauses in Brand gesetzt zu haben. Das harte Urteil reiht sich ein in eine Entwicklung hin zu immer h\u00f6heren Strafen f\u00fcr die Diffamierung der k\u00f6niglichen Familie in dem s\u00fcdostasiatischen Land. Die Anklage lautete nach Angaben der Organisation Thail\u00e4ndische Anw\u00e4lte f\u00fcr Menschenrechte unter anderem auf Majest\u00e4tsbeleidigung, Brandstiftung, und Sachbesch\u00e4digung. Vier von ihnen erhielten Gef\u00e4ngnisstrafen von elfeinhalb beziehungsweise sieben Jahren und acht Monaten. Die \u00fcbrigen zwei m\u00fcssen f\u00fcr drei Jahre und vier Monate ins Gef\u00e4ngnis. Die Staatsanwaltschaft Stuttgart ermittelt seit vergangener Woche gegen zwei Mitarbeiter des Autozulieferers Bosch. Wie die Staatsanwaltschaft mitteilte, verd\u00e4chtigt sie die beiden der Beihilfe zum Betrug im Zusammenhang mit Abgas-Betrugssoftware bei Dieselautos. Konkret geht um einen Jeep Grand Cherokee und einen Pick-up des Typs Dodge Ram 1500 des US-Autoherstellers Chrysler, die mit einer Abschaltvorrichtung des Abgasreinigungssystems ausgestattet worden sind. Die Staatsanwaltschaft geht davon aus, dass \"die relevanten Tatbeitr\u00e4ge\" dazu in ihrem Zust\u00e4ndigkeitsbereich geleistet wurden. Bosch erkl\u00e4rte dazu, die Firma kooperiere \"uneingeschr\u00e4nkt\" seit Bekanntwerden der Vorw\u00fcrfe mit den Ermittlern. Weiter wollte sich der Autozulieferer nicht \u00e4u\u00dfern Nach dem Fund von 500 Kilogramm Kokain in einem Privatjet in Gro\u00dfbritannien m\u00fcssen sich f\u00fcnf M\u00e4nner vor Gericht verantworten. Die Drogen im Wert von \u00fcber 50 Millionen Pfund (etwa 57 Millionen Euro) waren in 15 Koffern in dem aus Kolumbien kommenden Flugzeug versteckt. Es handelt sich um einen der gr\u00f6\u00dften Funde dieser Art in den vergangenen Jahren in Gro\u00dfbritannien. Die Ermittler nahmen zwei britische Br\u00fcder, zwei Spanier und einen Italiener fest, gegen die nun Anklage wegen Drogenschmuggels erhoben wurde. Das Flugzeug war am Montag kurz nach der Landung auf dem Farnborough Airport in Hampshire s\u00fcdwestlich von London durchsucht worden. Der deutsche Fu\u00dfball und insbesondere der VfL Bochum trauern um Trainer Rolf Schafstall. Nach VfL-Angaben starb der am 22. Februar 1937 in Duisburg geborene Fu\u00dfball-Lehrer am Dienstag im Alter von 80 Jahren. Schaffstall trainierte neben den Bochumern unter anderem den MSV Duisburg, den FC Schalke 04, Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf und Hannover 96. F\u00fcr einen grausamen Doppelmord ist ein 20-j\u00e4hriger Mann aus Herne zu lebenslanger Haft verurteilt worden. Das Bochumer Landgericht stellte am Mittwoch zudem die besondere Schwere der Schuld fest. Marcel H. hatte gestanden, im M\u00e4rz 2017 einen neunj\u00e4hrigen Nachbarsjungen und einen 22-j\u00e4hrigen Ex-Schulfreund umgebracht zu haben. Hongkong hat den Handel mit Elfenbein verboten. Wie der Legislativrat der chinesischen Sonderverwaltungszone nun entschied, soll das Verbot ab dem Jahr 2021 gelten. Verst\u00f6\u00dfe sollen mit bis zu zehn Jahren Haft bestraft werden. Hongkong folgt damit dem chinesischen Festland, wo der Handel mit Elfenbein bereits seit Ende vergangenen Jahres untersagt ist. Der Elfenbeinmarkt in Hongkong z\u00e4hle zu den gr\u00f6\u00dften der Welt und steht damit in direkter Verbindung zur massenhaften Wilderei auf die Dickh\u00e4uter in Afrika. Die Folge der starken Nachfrage nach Elfenbein ist laut WWF eine dramatische Wildereikrise in Afrika. Jedes Jahr werden nach Angaben der Umweltsch\u00fctzer etwa 20 000 Elefanten illegal get\u00f6tet. Der Discounter Aldi Nord will in Berlin rund 2000 Wohnungen bauen. Das k\u00fcndigte die Handelskette an. \"Das ist die Idee: Im Erdgeschoss ein Aldi-Markt und dar\u00fcber Wohnungen\", hie\u00df es. 200 Wohnungen in den Bezirken Neuk\u00f6lln und Lichtenberg w\u00fcrden in K\u00fcrze gebaut, weitere 15 Standorte in der Hauptstadt habe man im Blick. Aldi braucht f\u00fcr sein neues Konzept mit gr\u00f6\u00dferem Sortiment sowie frischem Obst, Gem\u00fcse, Fisch und Fleisch gr\u00f6\u00dfere Ladenfl\u00e4chen. Die Verbindung mit Wohnungen d\u00fcrfte es dem Unternehmen erleichtern, Baugenehmigungen zu bekommen. Denn der Senat will die oft nur eingeschossig bebauten Supermarktstandorte st\u00e4rker f\u00fcr Wohnungen nutzen. Vor \u00e4hnlichem Hintergrund baut Aldi schon in Hamburg. Ob der Discounter in Berlin auch als Vermieter auftritt oder seine Wohnungen verkaufen will, teilte das Unternehmen nicht mit. Frankreich will die D-Day-Str\u00e4nde der alliierten Landung in der Normandie zum Unesco-Weltkulturerbe erkl\u00e4ren lassen. Ein Sprecher der UN-Kulturorganisation best\u00e4tigte den Eingang der franz\u00f6sischen Nominierung. Das Pariser Kulturministerium teilte zur Begr\u00fcndung mit, die Str\u00e4nde tr\u00fcgen die Spuren eines \"Kampfes f\u00fcr die Freiheit und den Frieden\". Am sogenannten D-Day, dem 6. Juni 1944, waren alliierte Truppen im Zweiten Weltkrieg im von Deutschland besetzten Frankreich gelandet. Nach einer brutalen Attacke auf einen Teenager sind neun Jugendliche in Neapel gefasst worden. Die Minderj\u00e4hrigen werden verd\u00e4chtigt, einen 15-J\u00e4hrigen am 12. Januar au\u00dferhalb einer Metro-Station grundlos so schlimm zusammengeschlagen zu haben, dass dessen Milz in einer Notoperation entfernt werden musste, wie die Polizei mitteilte. Sie sollen einer sogenannten Baby Gang angeh\u00f6ren. Acht von ihnen kamen laut Polizei in betreute Wohngemeinschaften, ein mutma\u00dflicher Angreifer darf weiterhin bei seiner Familie wohnen. Immer wieder wird die s\u00fcditalienische Stadt - in der auch die Mafia-Organisation Camorra beheimatet ist - von Gewalttaten durch Jugendliche ersch\u00fcttert. Bei einem Bootsungl\u00fcck im Mittelmeer k\u00f6nnten am Wochenende bis zu 40 Migranten ertrunken sein. Das haben Aussagen von \u00dcberlebenden, die gestern Abend in Augusta auf Sizilien an Land gegangen waren, ergeben, wie der Sprecher der Internationalen Organisation f\u00fcr Migration, Flavio di Giacomo, heute twitterte. Am Samstag waren bei mehreren Rettungseins\u00e4tzen rund 800 Migranten unter anderem von der italienischen K\u00fcstenwache und Hilfsorganisationen gerettet worden. Zwei Leichen wurden geborgen. Weil sie Wasser in den Lungen hatten, mussten 16 Migranten - darunter sechs wiederbelebte Kinder - mit einem Milit\u00e4rhubschrauber ins tunesische Sfax ins Krankenhaus geflogen werden. Mehr als zwei Jahre nach einem Selbstmordanschlag auf Deutsche in Istanbul hat ein t\u00fcrkisches Gericht drei Syrer zu lebenslanger Haft verurteilt. Mehrere weitere Beschuldigte wurden in Istanbul freigesprochen. Den Verurteilten wurden unter anderem Mitgliedschaft im IS, vors\u00e4tzliche T\u00f6tung und versuchter Umsturz der verfassungsm\u00e4\u00dfigen Ordnung vorgeworfen. Bei dem Anschlag am 12. Januar 2016 im Istanbuler Altstadtviertel Sultanahmet waren zw\u00f6lf Deutsche get\u00f6tet und 16 Menschen verletzt worden. Wer aus medizinischen Gr\u00fcnden Cannabis konsumieren darf, muss seinen Waffenschein abgeben. Das geht aus einem Urteil des Bayerischen Verwaltungsgerichtshofs hervor, das in M\u00fcnchen ver\u00f6ffentlicht wurde. Ein J\u00e4ger aus dem Landkreis Miesbach wollte nicht akzeptieren, dass das Landratsamt ihm die Waffenbesitzkarte und den Jagdschein entzogen hatte - weil er t\u00e4glich mehrfach Cannabisbl\u00fcten inhaliert. Das Gericht ist allerdings der Auffassung, dass auch bei medizinisch begr\u00fcndetem regelm\u00e4\u00dfigem Cannabis-Konsum ein verl\u00e4sslicher Umgang mit Waffen und Munition nicht gew\u00e4hrleistet ist. Es gebe keine ausreichenden wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisse, wonach sich die Wirkungsweisen des Rauschmittels bei medizinisch \u00fcberwachtem Cannabis-Konsum von denen bei Cannabis-Missbrauch unterscheiden. Erstmals \u00fcbernehmen AfD-Abgeordnete den Vorsitz in drei Bundestagsaussch\u00fcssen. Sie erhielten in den Gremien f\u00fcr Haushalt, Recht und Tourismus die n\u00f6tige Mehrheit. Normalerweise m\u00fcssen sich die Vorsitzenden nicht zur Wahl stellen, sondern werden lediglich bestimmt. Da jedoch mehrere Ausschussmitglieder Widerspruch gegen die Nominierten anmeldeten, wurden Wahlen notwendig. Der AfD-Abgeordnete und Euro-Gegner Peter Boehringer wurde in offener Wahl mit den Stimmen seiner eigenen Partei und der FDP zum Vorsitzenden des Haushaltsausschusses gew\u00e4hlt. Der Rechtsausschuss w\u00e4hlte den AfD-Abgeordneten Stephan Brandner zu seinem Vorsitzenden. Den Ausschuss f\u00fcr Tourismus leitet k\u00fcnftig der junge AfD-Abgeordnete Sebastian M\u00fcnzenmaier. Union und FDP stimmten bei seiner Wahl mit Ja, die Linke mit Nein. SPD und Gr\u00fcne enthielten sich. Ein wegen sexuellen Missbrauchs von Patientinnen angeklagter Arzt hat vor dem Landgericht Konstanz ein Gest\u00e4ndnis abgelegt. Das teilte der Vorsitzende Richter mit. Die \u00d6ffentlichkeit war w\u00e4hrend des Gest\u00e4ndnisses mit Blick auf die Pers\u00f6nlichkeitsrechte des 39-J\u00e4hrigen von der Verhandlung ausgeschlossen worden. Die Staatsanwaltschaft wirft dem fr\u00fcheren Oberarzt und Facharzt f\u00fcr Neurologie vor, an mehreren Patientinnen sexuelle Handlungen vorgenommen zu haben. Dabei soll er die Frauen gebeten haben, sich bis auf die Unterw\u00e4sche zu entkleiden. Bei der Untersuchung soll er den Slip der Patientinnen teilweise zur Seite geschoben und die Frauen an und zwischen den Schamlippen ber\u00fchrt haben. Dabei habe der Mann das Beratungs-, Behandlungs- oder Betreuungsverh\u00e4ltnis zu den Frauen ausgenutzt. Betroffen sind laut Anklage f\u00fcnf Patientinnen - die Taten sollen zwischen April 2014 und Februar 2015 geschehen sein. In einem Prozess um den verbotenen Salafisten-Verein Millatu Ibrahim hat das Landgericht Hamburg die zw\u00f6lf Angeklagten freigesprochen. \"Die Beweisaufnahme hat Indizien ergeben, aber in keiner Weise Erkenntnisse, die f\u00fcr eine Verurteilung ausreichen\", sagte der Vorsitzende Richter. Auch Staatsanwaltschaft und Verteidigung hatten auf Freispruch pl\u00e4diert. Den M\u00e4nnern im Alter von 25 bis 37 Jahren war vorgeworfen worden, Unterst\u00fctzer der seit 2012 verbotenen salafistischen Vereinigung zu sein und sich regelm\u00e4\u00dfig in einer Moschee in Hamburg-Harburg getroffen zu haben. Zudem sollen sie Koranverteilungsst\u00e4nde organisiert haben. Laut Anklage verstie\u00dfen sie damit gegen das Vereinsverbot. Knapp zwei Monate nach dem Verschwinden eines 35-J\u00e4hrigen in D\u00fcsseldorf ist die Leiche des Mannes 114 Kilometer entfernt im niederl\u00e4ndischen Nijmegen gefunden worden. Wie der Mann ums Leben gekommen ist, sei noch unklar, teilte die Polizei nun mit. Vermutlich ist er in den Rhein gefallen und mit dem Fluss bis in die Niederlande getrieben. Der Oberhausener war seit dem 3. Dezember 2017 als vermisst gemeldet, nachdem er nach einer Weihnachtsfeier mit einem Arbeitskollegen in der D\u00fcsseldorfer Altstadt alleine nach Hause gegangen war. Dass eine Wasserleiche so weit treibe, sei nicht ungew\u00f6hnlich, sagt der Pressesprecher der Wasserschutzpolizei Duisburg, Ramon van der Maat. Der Bau der umstrittenen Ostseepipeline Nord Stream 2 hat eine weitere H\u00fcrde genommen. Das Bergamt Stralsund, das f\u00fcr die Genehmigung in den deutschen K\u00fcstengew\u00e4ssern zust\u00e4ndig ist, gab heute gr\u00fcnes Licht f\u00fcr den Bau. Nach der Pr\u00fcfung aller eingereichten Unterlagen sowie der Abw\u00e4gung der dazu eingegangenen Einwendungen habe die Beh\u00f6rde den Bau und Betrieb der Pipeline \u00fcber 55 Kilometer im deutschen K\u00fcstenmeer f\u00fcr zul\u00e4ssig erkl\u00e4rt, teilte das Energieministerium des Landes Mecklenburg-Vorpommern mit. Wegen der zunehmenden Gewalt in Mexiko hat die Regierung mehr als 5000 zus\u00e4tzliche Sicherheitskr\u00e4fte in mehrere Urlaubsorte und andere Gebiete des Landes entsandt. Die Ma\u00dfnahme solle \"diese wachsende Gewalt schnell verringern\", erkl\u00e4rte der mexikanische Innenminister Alfonso Navarrete in Mexiko-Stadt. Verst\u00e4rkt wurden die Sicherheitskr\u00e4fte vor allem im Ferienort Canc\u00fan sowie in der Region Baja California Sur mit den Badeorten Los Cabos und La Paz geschickt. Die Linke beantragt im Haushaltsausschuss des Bundestags eine Abstimmung \u00fcber den AfD-Kandidaten f\u00fcr den Vorsitz des Gremiums. Das k\u00fcndigte die Linken-Haush\u00e4lterin Gesine L\u00f6tzsch vor Beginn der konstituierenden Ausschusssitzung an. Der AfD-Kandidat Peter Boehringer habe sich in der Vergangenheit rassistisch und frauenfeindlich ge\u00e4u\u00dfert, begr\u00fcndete L\u00f6tzsch den Schritt. Normalerweise werden die Vorsitzenden der Bundestagsaussch\u00fcsse nicht gew\u00e4hlt, sondern nur bestimmt. Wenn aber eine andere Fraktion Widerspruch gegen einen Kandidaten einlegt, muss es stattdessen eine Wahl des Vorsitzenden geben. Zwei Tote hat die Polizei in Darmstadt nahe dem Hauptbahnhof gefunden. Die Polizei geht von einem Gewaltverbrechen aus. Zeugen hatten von Sch\u00fcssen und einem brennenden Auto berichtet und die Beh\u00f6rden alarmiert, wie eine Polizeisprecherin mitteilte. Die Feuerwehr l\u00f6schte am Tatort ein brennendes Auto. Zuvor hatte das \"Darmst\u00e4dter Echo\" dar\u00fcber berichtet. In dem Auto wurde laut Polizei ein toter Mann aufgefunden, die Leiche einer Frau wurde in der N\u00e4he entdeckt. Das Fahrzeug war auf einem Parkplatz in einem Hof abgestellt. Es handele sich m\u00f6glicherweise um ein T\u00f6tungsdelikt und einen Suizid. In \u00d6sterreich soll die Burschenschaft Germania nach dem Skandal um ein Liederbuch mit antisemitischen Texten aufgel\u00f6st werden. Ein entsprechendes Verfahren solle eingeleitet werden, sagte Bundeskanzler Sebastian Kurz (\u00d6VP). Unterdessen wurde bekannt, dass einer der vier Verd\u00e4chtigen in der Aff\u00e4re ein Mitglied der Sozialdemokraten war. Die SP\u00d6 schloss den Mann, der das 1997 neu aufgelegte Liederbuch illustriert haben soll, sofort aus der Partei aus. Der Vizekanzler und FP\u00d6-Chef Heinz-Christian Strache sieht dagegen weiter keinen Grund, den FP\u00d6-Spitzenpolitiker Udo Landbauer aus der Partei zu verbannen. Der 31-J\u00e4hrige habe erkl\u00e4rt, dass er den Text nicht gekannt habe. Landbauer war Vizepr\u00e4sident der Burschenschaft. Apple ist wegen der Leistungsdrosselung bei \u00e4lteren iPhone-Modellen jetzt auch im Visier der US-Beh\u00f6rden. Das Justizministerium und die B\u00f6rsenaufsicht SEC pr\u00fcfen laut der Nachrichtenagentur Bloomberg, ob Apple seine Kunden mit Einf\u00fchrung dieser Drosselung sofort h\u00e4tte informieren m\u00fcssen - und nicht erst, nachdem Kunden sich dar\u00fcber beschwert hatten. Apple hatte im Dezember einger\u00e4umt, dass \u00e4ltere Smartphones per Software-Update verlangsamt werden, um zu verhindern, dass sie sich pl\u00f6tzlich ausschalten. Eingef\u00fchrt hatte der Technologiekonzern dieses Update bereits vor einem Jahr. Mittlerweile hat sich Apple bei den Kunden daf\u00fcr entschuldigt, den Akkuwechsel deutlich verbilligt und angek\u00fcndigt, dass die Nutzer bald selbst \u00fcber die - empfohlene - Leistungsdrosselung entscheiden k\u00f6nnen. Bloomberg berichtete unter Berufung auf informierte Kreise, die sp\u00e4te Information der Kunden k\u00f6nnte einen Gesetzesversto\u00df darstellen. Die Zahl der Arbeitslosen in Deutschland ist im Januar im Vergleich zum Vormonat um 185.000 auf 2,57 Millionen gestiegen. Gegen\u00fcber dem Vorjahr ging die Zahl der Erwerbslosen um 207.000 zur\u00fcck, wie die Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Arbeit in N\u00fcrnberg mitteilte. Die Arbeitslosenquote stieg um 0,5 Punkte auf 5,8 Prozent. Bei einem r\u00e4tselhaften Schusswechsel im Urwald von Kambodscha sind drei M\u00e4nner get\u00f6tet worden. Die beiden Beamten und ein Umweltsch\u00fctzer waren auf einem Kontrollgang im abgelegenen Naturreservat Keo Seima an der Grenze zu Vietnam, als es zu einem Feuergefecht mit vermeintlichen Grenzbeamten kam, wie die Zeitung \"Phnom Penh Post\" berichtete. Spekuliert wurde dar\u00fcber, dass die drei M\u00e4nner Holzdiebe auf frischer Tat ertappten. In dem s\u00fcdostasiatischen Staat wird seit vielen Jahren Tropenholz in gro\u00dfem Stil abgeholzt. Ein schweres Erdbeben hat den Nordosten Afghanistans ersch\u00fcttert. Nach Angaben der US-Erdbebenwarte USGS hatte das Beben eine St\u00e4rke von 6,1, sein Zentrum lag nahe der Grenze zu Tadschikistan im Hindukusch-Gebirge in einer Tiefe von 191 Kilometern. Die Ersch\u00fctterungen waren auch in der pakistanischen Hauptstadt Islamabad und in der indischen Hauptstadt Neu Delhi zu sp\u00fcren. In Pakistan kam ein Baby ums Leben, als im Haus seiner Familie in der s\u00fcdwestlichen Provinz Baluchistan das Dach einst\u00fcrzte. Wie ein Beh\u00f6rdenvertreter mitteilte, wurden neun weitere Familienmitglieder verletzt. \u00dcber weitere Opfer oder Sch\u00e4den durch das Erdbeben war zun\u00e4chst nichts bekannt. Im US-Bundesstaat Texas ist ein wegen Mordes an seiner Frau und seiner Freundin verurteilter H\u00e4ftling hingerichtet worden. Der 64-j\u00e4hrige William Rayford erhielt im Gef\u00e4ngnis von Huntsville eine t\u00f6dliche Injektion und wurde gestern Abend f\u00fcr tot erkl\u00e4rt, wie die Strafvollzugsbeh\u00f6rde mitteilte. Zuvor hatte der Oberste Gerichtshof der USA einen letzten Einspruch gegen die Vollstreckung des Todesurteils abgelehnt. Der Afroamerikaner Rayford wurde wegen der Ermordung seiner Freundin im Jahr 1999 zum Tode verurteilt. Zuvor war er bereits wegen der Ermordung seiner Ehefrau im Jahr 1986 zu 23 Jahren Gef\u00e4ngnis verurteilt worden. Er sa\u00df acht Jahre der Haftstrafe ab und war zum Zeitpunkt des zweiten Mordes auf Bew\u00e4hrung frei. Der Juso-Vorsitzende Kevin K\u00fchnert hat die Einigung von SPD und Union zum Familiennachzug f\u00fcr Fl\u00fcchtlinge kritisiert. Auf dem SPD-Parteitag sei eine \"weitergehende H\u00e4rtefallregelung\" gefordert worden, sagte K\u00fchnert im Deutschlandfunk. \"Dieser Auftrag ist nicht erf\u00fcllt worden.\" Union und SPD hatten sich am Dienstag darauf verst\u00e4ndigt, die Aussetzung des Nachzugs f\u00fcr Fl\u00fcchtlinge mit eingeschr\u00e4nktem Schutzstatus bis Ende Juli zu verl\u00e4ngern. Danach soll ein monatliches Kontingent von tausend Menschen f\u00fcr den Nachzug von Familienmitgliedern gelten. Daneben bleibt die bisherige H\u00e4rtefallregelung bestehen. Franz\u00f6sische und spanische Rettungskr\u00e4fte suchen am Mittwoch weiter nach Pierre Agnes, dem Chef der Modemarke Quiksilver. Nach einem Angelausflug auf dem Atlantik war Agnes' Boot am Dienstag an den Strand von Hossegor im S\u00fcdwesten Frankreichs gesp\u00fclt worden, wie die \u00f6rtliche Marinepr\u00e4fektur mitteilte. Der 54-j\u00e4hrige Agnes hatte um 7.30 Uhr gestern Morgen auf seinem Elf-Meter-Boot Mascaret III abgelegt, wie \u00f6rtliche Medien unter Berufung auf die Beh\u00f6rden berichteten. Sp\u00e4ter funkte er, dass er wegen Nebel sp\u00e4ter als geplant zur\u00fcckkehre, wie die franz\u00f6sische Nachrichtenagentur AFP meldete. Um 9.17 Uhr wurde das Boot ohne Agnes am Strand gefunden. Den Dienstag \u00fcber suchten Rettungskr\u00e4fte aus Frankreich und Spanien nach ihm. Die Suche blieb zun\u00e4chst erfolglos. Auf einer Auktion in Australien sind versehentlich Regierungspapiere versteigert worden, die zum Teil als \"streng geheim\" deklariert waren. Die Dokumente stammen nach einem Bericht des Fernsehsenders ABC vom Mittwoch von insgesamt f\u00fcnf verschiedenen fr\u00fcheren Regierungen. Der amtierende Premierminister Malcolm Turnbull gab eine Untersuchung in Auftrag, wie sie an die \u00d6ffentlichkeit gelangen konnten. Mehrere Dokumente tragen noch den Stempel \"Top Secret\". Die Papiere wurden in \u00e4lteren B\u00fcrom\u00f6beln aus Regierungsbestand entdeckt, die k\u00fcrzlich bei einer Auktion in der Hauptstadt Canberra versteigert wurden. Dem TV-Bericht zufolge waren die M\u00f6bel nicht allzu teuer, weil sie abgeschlossen und die Schl\u00fcssel nicht mehr zu finden waren. Dann sei es aber doch jemandem gelungen, die Schl\u00f6sser zu knacken. Der Sender konnte die Papiere nach eigenen Angaben \u00fcber mehrere Tage sichten. Die radikalislamischen Taliban bedrohen einer Recherche der BBC zufolge rund 70 Prozent Afghanistans - bedeutend mehr als zuvor gesch\u00e4tzt. In der nun ver\u00f6ffentlichten Zusammenfassung der im Herbst 2017 \u00fcber mehrere Monate gesammelten Daten hei\u00dft es, dass die Islamisten die volle Kontrolle \u00fcber 14 Bezirke (vier Prozent des Landes) und eine aktive Pr\u00e4senz in weiteren 263 Bezirken (66 Prozent des Landes) h\u00e4tten. Damit leben \"um die 15 Millionen Afghanen - die H\u00e4lfte der Bev\u00f6lkerung - in Gegenden, die entweder von den Taliban kontrolliert werden oder in denen die Taliban offen pr\u00e4sent sind und regelm\u00e4\u00dfig Angriffe ver\u00fcben\", berichtete die BBC. Nach eigenen Angaben hat die BBC f\u00fcr die Studie zwischen August und November mehr als 1200 Menschen aus allen Bezirken befragt. In Indonesien hat eine Familie zwei Jahre lang mit der Leiche des verstorbenen Vaters im Haus gelebt. Die sterblichen \u00dcberreste des 84-J\u00e4hrigen wurden von einem Sozialarbeiter entdeckt, der der Familie in der Gemeinde Cimahi auf der Insel Java einen Besuch abstatten wollte. Der Tote war nach Polizeiangaben lediglich in eine Decke eingeh\u00fcllt. Bei einer gr\u00fcndlicheren Untersuchung wurde dann noch eine zweite Leiche gefunden: offenbar die \u00e4lteste Tochter des Paars, eine etwa 50 Jahre alte Frau. Auf der Pazifikinsel Nauru - einem der kleinsten Staaten der Welt - haben die etwa 10.000 Bewohner nach fast drei Jahren wieder Zugang zu Facebook. Pr\u00e4sident Baron Waqa k\u00fcndigte an, die staatliche Blockade des sozialen Netzwerks mit sofortiger Wirkung aufzuheben. Die Blockade hatte seit Mai 2015 gegolten. Waqa begr\u00fcndete dies damals damit, dass das Land vor \"Kriminellen und sexuell Perversen\" gesch\u00fctzt werden m\u00fcsse. S\u00fcden von Mexiko haben die Ermittler sieben zerst\u00fcckelte Leichen entdeckt. Die menschlichen \u00dcberreste seien in 15 Plastikt\u00fcten nahe der Ortschaft Chilapa in der Unruheprovinz Guerrero entdeckt worden, teilten die \u00f6rtlichen Sicherheitsbeh\u00f6rden gestern mit. Unter den Opfern war demnach mindestens eine Frau. Mexiko wird derzeit von einer beispiellosen Gewaltwelle \u00fcberrollt. Mit 29.168 T\u00f6tungsdelikten war das vergangene Jahr das schlimmste in der j\u00fcngeren Geschichte des Landes. Rund 30.000 Menschen gelten au\u00dferdem als verschwunden. Die Regierung Perus hat eine st\u00e4rkere \u00dcberwachung der zum Weltkulturerbe z\u00e4hlenden Nazca-Linien angeordnet, nachdem ein Lastwagen \u00fcber die arch\u00e4ologische St\u00e4tte gefahren war. Das 450 Quadratkilometer gro\u00dfe Areal solle k\u00fcnftig auch nachts und mit Drohnen \u00fcberwacht werden, teilte das Kulturministerium am Dienstag (Ortszeit) mit. Am Samstag hatte ein Lastwagenfahrer Reifenspuren auf den 2000 Jahre alten Geoglyphen hinterlassen. Er wurde festgenommen und angeklagt. Der Lastwagen habe auf einer Strecke von rund hundert Metern drei Linien besch\u00e4digt, die Teil eines Eidechsenbildes seien, berichtete die Zeitung \"El Comercio\". Der Fahrer gab an, er sei in das gesch\u00fctzte Gebiet eingedrungen, um einen Reifen zu wechseln. Beim Absturz eines Hubschraubers in einem Wohngebiet im kalifornischen Newport Beach sind drei Menschen get\u00f6tet worden. Nach Mitteilung der Polizei befanden sich vier Personen an Bord des Helikopters. F\u00fcnf Menschen seien von dem Unfall betroffen gewesen, darunter auch einer in dem Wohngebiet. Der Absturz ereignete sich in einer Reihenhaussiedlung in der N\u00e4he des John-Wayne-Flughafens, wie die Flughafenverwaltung mitteilte. In Fernsehbildern waren Teile des zertr\u00fcmmerten Hubschraubers im Vorgarten und auf dem Dach eines Hauses zu sehen. Union und SPD haben bei ihren Koalitionsverhandlungen eine Einigung \u00fcber Verbesserungen in der Pflege erreicht. K\u00fcnftig soll es in der Branche fl\u00e4chendeckende Tarifvertr\u00e4ge geben, wie die rheinland-pf\u00e4lzische Ministerpr\u00e4sidentin Malu Dreyer (SPD) gestern Abend in Berlin sagte. Daf\u00fcr solle es k\u00fcnftig schneller m\u00f6glich sein, einen Tarifvertrag f\u00fcr allgemeinverbindlich zu erkl\u00e4ren. Es solle au\u00dferdem Erleichterungen bei der Beantragung von Leistungen geben, etwa auch beim \"pr\u00e4ventiven Hausbesuch\". Von ihm sollen \u00e4ltere Menschen profitieren, die noch nicht pflegebed\u00fcrftig sind. Der Mitarbeiter, der am 13. Januar die Bev\u00f6lkerung auf Hawaii mit einem falschen Raketenalarm in Angst und Schrecken versetzte, glaubte wirklich an einen unmittelbar bevorstehenden Angriff. Das geht der \"Washington Post\" zufolge aus einem vorl\u00e4ufigen Untersuchungsbericht der f\u00fcr Kommunikationswege zust\u00e4ndigen US-Bundesbeh\u00f6rde FCC hervor. Am Dienstag (Ortszeit) trat ein f\u00fchrendes Mitglied des hawaiianischen Katastrophenschutzes zur\u00fcck. Der Attent\u00e4ter des Lieferwagen-Anschlags auf Muslime in London wollte nach eigenen Angaben den britischen Labour-Chef Jeremy Corbyn und den Londoner B\u00fcrgermeister Sadiq Khan t\u00f6ten. Dies sagte der 48-j\u00e4hrige Darren Osborne gestern vor einem Gericht in London aus. Demnach wollte er die beiden Politiker bei einem pro-pal\u00e4stinensischen Marsch treffen, zu dem Corbyn erwartet wurde. Aufgrund zahlreicher Stra\u00dfensperrungen wegen der Veranstaltung soll der Vater von vier Kindern aus dem walisischen Cardiff dann am 19. Juni in London mit einem Lieferwagen in eine Gruppe von Muslimen gerast sein, die vom Abendgebet in der Finsbury-Park-Moschee kamen. Ein Mann starb, elf weitere Menschen wurden verletzt. Augenzeugen zufolge rief der Fahrer, er wolle \"alle Muslime t\u00f6ten\".",

        "structuredText": "<div> \n <p>Toronto's booming tech sector has pushed down office vacancy rates, driven up demand for engineering talent \u2013 and helped turn an online catering service called Platterz Inc. into one of Canada's fastest-growing startups.</p> \n <p>Platterz, founded in 2015 by Israeli-Canadian entrepreneurs Eran Henig and Yishay Waxman, is announcing on Thursday that it has raised US$15-million in venture financing after securing some of the top tech companies operating in the Toronto-Waterloo corridor as regular customers. The deal is being led by Israeli venture-capital firm Aleph and backed by past investors AltaIR Capital, an Israeli VC firm, and Tony Lacavera's Globalive Capital.</p> \n <p>Shopify Inc., Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., Twitter Inc., LinkedIn Corp., Uber Technologies Inc. and salesforce.com are among the Platterz tech customers who regularly feed their local employees breakfast, lunch and/or snacks, one of the perks of working in the fast-growing sector in which talent is in demand and employees spend long hours at work. Shopify alone orders hundreds of meals several times a week through Platterz for employees in its Waterloo, Ont., Toronto and Montreal offices. With a solid foothold in New York, Platterz is now starting to expand to other urban centres across North America. \"We feel there's an opportunity to dominate corporate catering,\" said Mr. Waxman, the 45-year-old president.</p> \n <p>Platterz is one of many companies that have crowded into the technology-enabled food-delivery market, attracting heavy interest from venture capitalists but a cooler response so far from the public markets. Vancouver-based Foodee, ZeroCater and Chewse of San Francisco and Boston's ezCater have all raised venture backing for their own online catering services, while consumer-oriented home meal-kit delivery companies Blue Apron Holdings Inc., HelloFresh SE and Montreal's Goodfood Market Corp. have gone public in the past year with mixed results. Winnipeg-based restaurant delivery service SkipTheDishes Restaurant Services Inc., meanwhile, sold to Britain-based rival Just Eat PLC in 2016 for $110-million.</p> \n <p>Platterz is a software company itself: It doesn't make or deliver the food, but provides a digital ordering platform that connects corporate customers to hundreds of local restaurants in its core markets of Toronto and New York; Mr. Henig estimates its 50 top vendors in Toronto are making $100,000 apiece on an annualized basis.

        "text": "Toronto's booming tech sector has pushed down office vacancy rates, driven up demand for engineering talent \u2013 and helped turn an online catering service called Platterz Inc. into one of Canada's fastest-growing startups. Platterz, founded in 2015 by Israeli-Canadian entrepreneurs Eran Henig and Yishay Waxman, is announcing on Thursday that it has raised US$15-million in venture financing after securing some of the top tech companies operating in the Toronto-Waterloo corridor as regular customers. The deal is being led by Israeli venture-capital firm Aleph and backed by past investors AltaIR Capital, an Israeli VC firm, and Tony Lacavera's Globalive Capital. Shopify Inc., Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., Twitter Inc., LinkedIn Corp., Uber Technologies Inc. and salesforce.com are among the Platterz tech customers who regularly feed their local employees breakfast, lunch and/or snacks, one of the perks of working in the fast-growing sector in which talent is in demand and employees spend long hours at work. Shopify alone orders hundreds of meals several times a week through Platterz for employees in its Waterloo, Ont., Toronto and Montreal offices. With a solid foothold in New York, Platterz is now starting to expand to other urban centres across North America. \"We feel there's an opportunity to dominate corporate catering,\" said Mr. Waxman, the 45-year-old president. Platterz is one of many companies that have crowded into the technology-enabled food-delivery market, attracting heavy interest from venture capitalists but a cooler response so far from the public markets. Vancouver-based Foodee, ZeroCater and Chewse of San Francisco and Boston's ezCater have all raised venture backing for their own online catering services, while consumer-oriented home meal-kit delivery companies Blue Apron Holdings Inc., HelloFresh SE and Montreal's Goodfood Market Corp. have gone public in the past year with mixed results. Winnipeg-based restaurant delivery service SkipTheDishes Restaurant Services Inc., meanwhile, sold to Britain-based rival Just Eat PLC in 2016 for $110-million. Platterz is a software company itself: It doesn't make or deliver the food, but provides a digital ordering platform that connects corporate customers to hundreds of local restaurants in its core markets of Toronto and New York; Mr. Henig estimates its 50 top vendors in Toronto are making $100,000 apiece on an annualized basis. It also bills itself as an artificial-intelligence company, using its \"predictive meal builder\" software to help office staff put together food orders with a few clicks and remembering past orders and preferences to serve up meal recommendations. The whole ordering process takes a handful of minutes, simplifying and speeding up the typical ordering task while providing greater variety than most standard caterers. \"The corporate catering market that they operate in is very big and also a bit underserved,\" said Aaron Rosenson, an Aleph general partner. After two years in operation, Platterz has more than 1,200 customers, including such corporate stalwarts as Deloitte, Thomson Reuters and Toronto-Dominion Bank, although nearly 50 per cent are drawn from the tech sector.

        "text": "Jan 31 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc's earnings and revenue exceeded Wall Street forecasts for the first fiscal quarter as demand surged for its chips used in smartphones and cars, making up for a fall in licensing revenue. The results come as the San Diego-based chipmaker tries to rebuff a $103-billion takeover approach by Broadcom Ltd and close its long-pending $38-billion deal to buy automotive chip maker NXP Semiconductors. Qualcomm is trying to convince shareholders that it can boost earnings as a standalone company through a $1 billion cost reduction plan and by resolving license disputes including a high-profile patent battle with Apple Inc. But its earnings and revenue forecasts for the ongoing March quarter were well below what analysts were expecting, sending Qualcomm shares slightly lower in after-hours trading on Wednesday. Qualcomm expects $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion in second-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share of 65 cents to 75 cents. Analysts had estimated revenue of $5.58 billion and earnings of 85 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue at Qualcomm's CDMA technologies unit rose 13 percent to $4.65 billion in the first quarter ended Dec. 24. The business makes modem chips for phones as well as products for connected devices including cars and speakers. The licensing business recorded a 28 percent fall in revenue to $1.30 billion, weighed down by the Apple dispute. Apple sued Qualcomm last January, accusing it of overcharging for chips and of refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. \"We remain open to finding a path to resolution (with Apple),\" Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf said on a call with analysts. Qualcomm posted a net loss of $5.95 billion compared to a profit of $682 million a year earlier, reflecting a $6 billion one-time charge because of new U.S. tax laws and a $868 million charge for a fine imposed by the Korea Fair Trade Commission. Excluding one-time items, Qualcomm earned 98 cents per share, topping analysts' average estimate of 91 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 1.2 percent to $6.07 billion and exceeded analysts' estimates of $5.93 billion.
