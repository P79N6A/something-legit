                "body": "Groupon, the global marketplace for local services, experiences and goods, conducted its second annual Black Friday shopping trends survey and found that most people plan to begin their holiday shopping before they've even left for grandma's house--7:16 a.m. on Thanksgiving. The early morning time is more than eight hours earlier than last year when respondents identified 3:29 p.m. as their preferred start time. And while people are starting their shopping even earlier this year, they're not looking forward to it. According to the results, listening to an annoying children's song on repeat, getting gum stuck in your hair and passing gas during a job interview were identified as the top things people would rather experience than braving store crowds over the long weekend.\n\nThis press release features multimedia.

                "title": "Gemalto Third Quarter 2018 Revenue",
                "body": "Gemalto (Euronext NL0000400653 - GTO), the world leader in digital security today announces its revenue for the third quarter of 2018.\n\nPhilippe Vall\u00e9e, Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"As expected, Gemalto's third quarter revenue was slightly lower as large programs in both the Governments and Cybersecurity businesses are being delivered in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n\nIn parallel, Gemalto recorded a strong increase in deployments of its secure connectivity solutions for IoT industrial applications. In the Smartcards & Issuance segment, the Payment business posted a solid performance driven by the first EMV renewal campaigns in the US and strong payment card deployments across other regions. The recent Apple announcement introducing eSIM technology in its new generation of iPhones was an important milestone. It should trigger an acceleration in the rate of activations that will benefit Gemalto's eSIM solutions with Mobile Network Operators.\n\nAs we progress toward the end of the year, leveraging the traditional fourth quarter momentum and benefiting from the adjustments made to our cost base, we are confident in achieving our 2018 outlook.\"\n\nThe Identity, IoT & Cybersecurity segment comprises businesses associated with homeland security for governments (\"Governments\"), IoT connectivity for industrial applications (\"IoT\") and cybersecurity for enterprises (\"Cybersecurity\").\n\nThe Smartcards & Issuance segment comprises businesses mainly associated with removable SIM cards (\"SIM\"), payment cards (\"Payment\") and their issuance services. The segment includes as well businesses associated to the digital transformation of smart cards (\"Digital\") such as digital payment, digital banking, remote subscription management, embedded SIM/MIM and embedded secure elements. Patents business is also included in this segment.\n\nHistorical exchange rates and constant currency figures\n\nThe Company sells its products and services in a very large number of countries and is commonly remunerated in other currencies than the Euro. Fluctuations in these other currencies exchange rates against the Euro have in particular a translation impact on the reported Euro value of the Company revenues. Comparisons at constant exchange rates aim at eliminating the effect of currencies translation movements on the analysis of the Group revenue by translating prior-year revenues at the same average exchange rate as applied in the current year. Revenue variations are at constant exchange rates and include the impact of currencies variation hedging program, except where otherwise noted. All other figures in this press release are at historical exchange rates, except where otherwise noted.\n\nAdjusted income statement and profit from operations (PFO) non-GAAP measure\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and with section 2:362(9) of the Netherlands Civil Code.\n\nTo better assess its past and future performance, the Company also prepares an adjusted income statement where the key metric used to evaluate the business and make operating decisions over the period 2010 to 2018 is the profit from operations (PFO).\n\nPFO is a non-GAAP measure defined as IFRS operating profit adjusted for (i) the amortization and impairment of intangibles resulting from acquisitions, (ii) restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, (iii) all equity-based compensation charges and associated costs; and (iv) fair value adjustments upon business acquisitions. These items are further explained as follows:\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable IFRS measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.\n\nIn the adjusted income statement, Operating Expenses are defined as the sum of Research and Engineering expenses, Sales and Marketing expenses, General and Administrative expenses, and Other income (expense) net.\n\nEBITDA is defined as PFO plus depreciation and amortization expenses, excluding the above amortization and impairment of intangibles resulting from acquisitions.\n\nNet debt and net cash\n\nNet debt is a non IFRS measure defined as total borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents. Net cash is a non IFRS measure defined as cash and cash equivalents net of total borrowings.\n\nAll figures presented in this press release are unaudited.\n\nSegment information\n\nGemalto posted revenue of \u0080727 million, lower by (3%) both at constant exchange rates and historical exchange rates from the same period of last year. The contributions to the Company's total revenue were respectively 47% for the Identity, IoT & Cybersecurity segment and 53% for the Smartcards & Issuance segment.\n\nIdentity, IoT & Cybersecurity\n\nThe Identity, IoT & Cybersecurity segment's revenue came in at \u0080345 million, down (1%) compared to the previous year as large programs in both the Governments and Cybersecurity businesses are being delivered in the fourth quarter of 2018. The segment year-to-date revenue reached \u0080989 million, increasing +12% compared with the same period of last year.\n\nThe Governments business revenue declined in the third quarter compared with the same period of last year with significant e-documents programs rolling out in the US and Latin America in the fourth quarter of 2018, together with the first deliveries of the UK passport. In the third quarter, Gemalto was selected by the state of Georgia in the US for the supply of driver's license solution. The solution comprises an advanced enrollment system that includes photo and signature capture. The driving license will use premium polycarbonate including Multiple Laser Images (MLIs) to reduce document forgery and protect against identity fraud. This program win is another example of the depth and completeness of Gemalto offers for Governments to protect their citizens' identities.\n\nThe Cybersecurity business revenue was slightly down this quarter as several encryption program deployments notably in Europe and the US are also taking place in the fourth quarter of 2018. The software monetization and authentication sub-business lines posted a solid performance. As part of its cloud offer, Gemalto announced this quarter the launch of its next-generation key management solution, SafeNet Virtual KeySecure. This innovative solution integrated with leading cloud service providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, IBM cloud and VMware provides companies with a single key management solution spanning multiple private or public cloud environments. As a result, companies can extend their data protection policies to private and public clouds and centralize encryption and key management operations across multiple cloud environments. Companies can also improve key security and audit process by retaining ownership and control of encryption keys.\n\nThe IoT business posted another very strong performance in this quarter. The increase was driven by strong deliveries in Europe and Asia to large customers in Automotive, Health, Payment and Metering sectors. This quarter performance once again reflects the strong fit of Gemalto's offers with the highly challenging requirements of fast developing IoT industrial applications.\n\nSmartcards & Issuance\n\nThe Smartcards & Issuance segment posted revenue of \u0080382 million, (4%) lower at constant exchange rates.\n\nThe Payment business posted a solid performance this quarter on the back of strong sales in the US driven by the first EMV renewal campaigns and strong payment card deployments across other regions. The SIM business declined this quarter due to the continued market erosion and the full effect of the exit of a specific low-end market. In line with the profit margin objectives for the segment, low profit margin opportunities in both SIM and Payment businesses were dismissed in several Asian countries.\n\nThe Digital business enjoyed solid revenue growth, essentially driven by large deployments in Europe of authentication solutions that are part of the digital banking sub-business line. Following the recent Apple announcement introducing eSIM technology in its new generation of iPhones, the need for remote subscription management solutions (On Demand Connectivity) is rising. Mobile Network Operators are stepping up their infrastructure readiness to offer users the choice of activating their new generation iPhones either through a removable SIM or an eSIM. This should in turn trigger an acceleration in the rate of activations that will benefit Gemalto's eSIM solutions with Mobile Network Operators.\n\nThales combination\n\nIn December 2017 Thales and Gemalto reached an agreement on a recommended all-cash offer for all issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Gemalto. This offer was launched on March 27, 2018. We are working together with Thales towards achieving the regulatory and antitrust approvals required to complete the transaction. The transaction is currently expected to close in the first quarter of 2019, after Thales has secured all customary regulatory approvals and clearances. More information on the Thales offer and the integration, including the offer document and related press releases, can be found on our website at Public Offer by Thales.\n\nBelow is a highlight of new contracts and achievements published by the Company in the third quarter of 2018.\n\nLive Audio Webcast and Conference call\n\nGemalto third quarter 2018 revenue presentation will be webcast in English today at 3:00 PM Amsterdam and Paris time (2:00 PM London time and 9:00 AM New York time).\n\nAudio webcast\n\nA listen-only live audio webcast of the presentation and the Q&A session will be accessible here on our Investor Relations website via the link below:\n\nGemalto webcast\n\nThis webcast is compatible with Android and iOS terminals, including iPads.

                "body": "Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc. (NYSE: APLE) (the \"Company\" or \"Apple Hospitality\") today provided an update on operations at its hotels in the path of Hurricane Michael.\n\n\"We are deeply saddened by the devastation of Hurricane Michael across the Florida Panhandle,\" said Justin Knight, President and Chief Executive Officer of Apple Hospitality REIT. \"We commend the operating teams at our hotels for their courage during the storm and their dedication to the well-being of our guests and associates. As recovery from this storm moves forward, we will continue to support the ongoing efforts of our operating teams to care for our guests, associates and surrounding communities.\"\n\nApple Hospitality's two hotels in the Panama City, Florida area sustained considerable wind- and water-related damage, as a result of Hurricane Michael. Based on initial assessments and remediation efforts, the Company anticipates its Hampton Inn & Suites by Hilton Panama City Beach Pier Park Area and TownePlace Suites by Marriott Panama City may be closed through the end of this year. The properties did not incur significant structural damage; however, the devastation to the area has lengthened the lead time for all remediation and repairs necessary for the properties to reopen. Subject to applicable deductibles, the Company anticipates coverage of losses from both property damage and business interruption for these properties. The combined named windstorm deductible for the two properties is less than $1 million. Preliminary reports from initial property inspections at the Company's other hotels in the path of Hurricane Michael have indicated minor damage and disruption. The Company remains focused on the welfare of guests and associates at its hotels and will continue to assess the overall impact as recovery continues. The Company maintains comprehensive insurance coverage for property, business interruption and other risks with respect to all of its hotels, with industry standard deductibles in each of the locations.\n\nAbout Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc.\n\nApple Hospitality REIT, Inc. (NYSE: APLE) is a publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns one of the largest and most diverse portfolios of upscale, select-service hotels in the United States. Apple Hospitality's portfolio consists of 241 hotels with more than 30,700 guest rooms located in 88 markets throughout 34 states.

They will be joined by EU High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini and Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen for a Summit of 51 countries from across Europe and Asia, in addition to the ASEAN Secretary General. Over two days and under the title \"Global Partners for Global Challenges\", leaders will discuss how Europe and Asia can develop their partnership across the three pillars of ASEM: political; economic and financial; and social and cultural. President Juncker will address leaders tomorrow morning on the topic of reinforcing the multilateral system: advancing the ASEM partnership on global issues. One month after the Commission and the High Representative presented their proposal to strengthen connectivity between Europe and Asia, and a few days after EU Foreign Ministers adopted conclusions on the topic, ASEM leaders will look at ways of enhancing sustainable connectivity between the two regions, which together account for 55% of global trade, 60% of the world's population, 65% of global GDP, and 75% of global tourism. Other topics for discussion include trade and investment, sustainable development and climate, and security challenges such as terrorism, non-proliferation, cyber security and irregular migration. A number of bilateral agreements are set to be signed in the margins of the ASEM Summit, including free trade, investment protection and partnership and cooperation agreements with Singapore, and an agreement on forest law enforcement, governance and trade with Vietnam. A press conference, including the participation of President Juncker, is foreseen for 15:30 on Friday and will be live on EbS. More information on the ASEM Summit is available on the website, in a factsheet and a brochure; more information on the trade and investment agreements with Singapore is available online. The ASEM Summit will be followed by the 9 EU-Republic of Korea Summit and an EU-ASEAN Leaders' Meeting (factsheet).

This cooperation will help to mobilise private investment in laboratory facilities providing timely, cost-effective and accurate diagnostic services for diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria, as well as support maternal and child healthcare. Under this collaboration between the EU and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, poorer people in low-income African countries will have better access to higher quality testing and, therefore, better chances of proper treatment. The articulation of this programme followed the announcement of President Juncker and Bill Gates earlier in the year on the Gates Foundation's intention to contribute to the EIP. Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development, Neven Mimica, said: \"Together with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, we are showcasing the EU's engagement in Africa. Through the Gates Foundation's contribution of \u20ac54 million to our External Investment Plan, we will unlock private investment in a sector where additional investments in state-of-the-art testing facilities are urgently needed in order to meet the health needs of ample sectors of the population. This also shows that our approach under the 'Africa - Europe Alliance' works and is attractive to other stakeholders.\" The full press release is available online.

More than 3,000 students can complete a Master's degree abroad thanks to Erasmus+ guarantees worth \u20ac8.5 million. Further information is available in today's press release by the European Investment Fund and Privredna banka Zagreb. More information on the Erasmus+ programme can be found here.

Commissioner for Regional policy Corina Cre\u0163u said: \"We had promised not to leave our Member States alone. We promised that we would help them bounce back. Today we are concretely delivering on our promises. Within a few weeks, EU assistance will reach these countries and help cover the costs of the damages caused by natural disasters in Bulgaria, Greece, Lithuania and Poland.\" The amount of \u20ac34 million is divided as follows: \u20ac2.5 million for the Greek island of Kos after the July 2017 earthquake, \u20ac12.2 million for Poland after the August 2017 storms and rainfalls, almost \u20ac17 million for Lithuania following the 2017 rainfall and floods and \u20ac2.2 million for Bulgaria after the storms and floods of October 2017. Money from the EU Solidarity Fund will be used to support reconstruction efforts and cover some of the costs of emergency services, temporary accommodation, clean-up operations and the protection of cultural heritage, to relieve the financial burden borne by national authorities in the wake of natural disasters. Since the EUSF was set up in 2002, after more than 80 disasters -- including floods, forest fires, earthquakes, storms and drought -- 24 countries have received EUSF aid totaling more than \u20ac5 billion for emergency and recovery operations.

The projects will receive near \u20ac3 million each for collaborative and inter-disciplinary research into topics ranging from quantum computing, removing space objects from orbit to fighting brain viruses. They have been selected under the European Innovation Council (EIC)pilot phase, which targets fast-moving, high-risk innovative products, services or business models with strong potential to create new markets. Carlos Moedas, Commissioner for Science, Research and Innovation, said: \"Through the European Innovation Council (EIC), we support future and emerging breakthrough technologies, which are key to unlocking many of the secrets to a better future and society. We are investing in innovative ideas and the individuals behind them to create news markets of the future.\" The projects selected today will receive funding under the Future and Emerging Technologies strand of the \u20ac2.7 billion EIC Pilot, which runs between 2018-2020under the Horizon 2020 EU Research and Innovation Programme. To date, the EIC pilot has already supported 1599 projects with \u20ac967.22 million in funding. As announced in the Renewed Agenda for Research and Innovation, the Commission has also proposed to follow up on this pilot phase by establishing a full-scale European Innovation Council that will offer a one-stop shop for high potential and breakthrough technologies, as well as for innovative companies with potential for scaling up.

The signing took place on the eve of a bilateral EU-Republic of Korea Summit. Commissioner Vella said: \"Putting an end to illegal fishing is one of the main objectives of the EU's international ocean governance agenda. By joining forces with the Republic of Korea, a world player in fisheries, we send a clear message to those breaking international law that there is no place for such products on our markets and we will continue to fight illegal fishing until we have fully eradicated it.\" The new partnership, in line with the objectives of the EU's Ocean Governance strategy, will help exchange information about suspected IUU-activities, enhance traceability of fishery products and promote sustainable fishing through education and training. Globally, IUU fishing is estimated to deprive coastal communities and honest fishermen of up to 20 billion euros of seafood and seafood products per year. A press release is available online.

In this context officials and experts from the EU and China met in Beijing from 15 to 18 October to advance cooperation and exchange practical experiences on competition policy. The 17 EU-China Competition Week marked the beginning of a dialogue between the European Commission and China's newly established State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR). Participants discussed a wide range of topics, in particular State aid rules and fair competition review. This follows the Memorandum of Understanding that the EU and China signed on 1 June 2017 to start a dialogue on State aid control. The EU-China Competition Week is part of the Competition Cooperation project, a 5-year EU-funded programme offering technical cooperation to competition authorities in Asia. It builds on a longstanding practice of competition dialogue between the EU and anti-monopoly enforcement agencies in China. The objective is to exchange experiences and strengthen convergence in competition policy, to the benefit of citizens and businesses in both in the EU and in Asia. More information about the European Commission's bilateral dialogue with China in the field of competition policy is available on the Commission's website.

On 30 August 2016, the Commission adopted a State aid decision finding that Ireland had granted undue tax benefits of up to \u20ac13 billion to Apple. The Commission concluded that these tax benefits were illegal under EU State aid rules as they allowed Apple to pay substantially less tax on profits recorded in Ireland than other companies subject to same national taxation laws and ordered Ireland to recover the amount of taxes that should have been paid by Apple. The deadline for Ireland to implement the Commission's decision and recover the illegal State aid was 3 January 2017. In view of the delay in recovery, on 4 October 2017 the Commission referred Ireland to the European Court of Justice for failure to recover the illegal State aid granted to Apple. On 6 September 2018, Ireland completed the recovery of the aid. A total of \u20ac14.3 billion including interest was repaid by Apple into an escrow fund pending the final judgments of the EU courts in the actions for annulment of the Commission decision brought by Ireland (Case T-778/16) and Apple (Case T-892/16). Taking into account that the payment into the escrow fund of the illegal aid removed the distortion of competition caused by that aid, the Commission has today decided to withdraw the Court action.

(\"NEP\") by the Carlyle Group LP (\"Carlyle\"), both of the US. NEP provides outsourced broadcast engineering and production solutions to production companies and broadcasters around the world. Carlyle is a global alternative asset manager, investing globally. The Commission found that, since Carlyle already has joint control over NEP prior to the transaction, the acquisition of sole control over NEP would not bring a significant change in the market. The Commission also concluded that the proposed acquisition would raise no competition concerns because there is no overlap between the activities of the companies. The transaction was examined under the simplified merger review procedure. More information is available on the Commission's competition website, in the public case register under the case number M.9107.

                "body": "TD Ameritrade is once again expanding its digital reach by teaming up with Oculus Go from Facebook to provide one of the first-of-its-kind immersive learning experience for investors. TD Ameritrade formally announced this relationship at its Investor Education Conference in Las Vegas, the largest investor education conference of its kind in the industry.\n\n\"Visualization is a powerful tool because it makes abstract things seem more real,\" said Sunayna Tuteja, head of strategic partnerships and emerging technologies at TD Ameritrade. \"Finance is often abstract, and we're excited to take first step in using the power of VR, combined with our expertise and knowledge, to further demystify the often complex topic of investing. We're on a journey to break down more barriers to entry when it comes to investing in the markets, and this is one more way we can do that.\"\n\nWith TD Ameritrade's first experience on Oculus Go, investors get a real-life view of things normally inaccessible to the public - taking them inside the NYSE, the CBOE and Bitcoin mine - to give them an intimate look at the world of finance.\n\nThrough its relationship, TD Ameritrade is one of the first to provide investor educational content on Oculus, allowing users to have an immersive way to learn about investing topics. Individuals can access the TD Ameritrade experience by visiting the Oculus Video app on the main menu. It is also accessible through the Oculus mobile app on a mobile device.\n\n\"Learning through an interactive experience is an exciting and immersive way that will help investors understand more complex issues and retain the knowledge learned for their own financial futures,\" explains Lee McAdoo, managing director, Investor Education at TD Ameritrade. \"By bringing our best-in-class educational content to new platforms like Oculus Go, we expand our ability to teach investors through platforms that can delight and educate them simultaneously.\"\n\nTD Ameritrade was ranked no. 1 broker overall in Kiplinger's Best Online Brokers of 2018, winning five-stars in the \"User Experience\" category for meeting clients on the platforms they spend the most time on. The firm was also awarded five-stars in the \"Tools\" category for its trove of educational content available to investors. Additionally, the firm was named best for \"Students of Investing.\" Learn more about TD Ameritrade's investor education offering by visiting the education page.\n\nIn addition to accessing educational content on Oculus Go, investors can also find educational resources from TD Ameritrade through other third-party platforms including: Facebook Messenger, Twitter DM, Amazon Alexa, Apple Business Chat, and WeChat (Hong Kong only).\n\nAbout TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation\n\nMillions of investors and independent registered investment advisors (RIAs) have turned to TD Ameritrade's (Nasdaq:AMTD) technology, people and education to help make investing and trading easier to understand and do.

Nun habe sich die Berechenbarkeit der Gesch\u00e4fte mit dem wichtigsten Kunden des Chipherstellers verbessert, schrieb Analyst Adithya Metuku in einer am Montag vorliegenden Studie. Zudem stiegen dadurch die Netto-Barmittel von Dialog wohl deutlich. Metuku sieht zudem \u00dcberraschungspotenzial mit Blick auf seine Margenerwartung f\u00fcr 2020. Der kommende Kapitalmarkttag k\u00f6nnte zum n\u00e4chsten Kurstreiber werden./ck/ag\n\nDatum der Analyse: 15.10.2018\n\nHinweis: Informationen zur Offenlegungspflicht bei Interessenkonflikten im Sinne von \u00a7 85 Abs. 1 WpHG, Art. 20 VO (EU) 596/2014 f\u00fcr das genannte Analysten-Haus finden Sie unter http://web.dpa-afx.de/offenlegungspflicht/offenlegungs_pflicht.html.",

                "body": "TD Ameritrade(Nasdaq: AMTD) today announced the launch of its Content Intelligence Platform (CIP), becoming the first in the financial services industry to design a CIP specifically for financial education. The platform leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to provide customized learning experiences for clients, organizing and categorizing all of TD Ameritrade's educational content, and recommending content based on clients' behavior.\n\n\"We believe education is absolutely critical to investing,\" said Lee McAdoo, managing director, Investor Education at TD Ameritrade. \"That's why TD Ameritrade's library of education content includes nearly 500 videos, 7 courses and more than 2,000 articles. But, we also know investors have limited time and evolving expectations, so we've created a customized, curated experience that will meet clients at any stage of financial fluency, enabling them to become smarter, faster.\"\n\nBeginning today, TD Ameritrade's education center will curate the most popular content, based on overall viewership numbers. And, as a client uses various types of educational content, the platform will learn that client's preferences and start suggesting related articles and videos. The Content Intelligence Platform will continue learning and evolving -- later this year, the platform will also have the capability to pull demographic information voluntarily provided by TD Ameritrade clients, such as age and marital status, to suggest more relevant content.\n\nInvestors are increasingly tech-forward and they expect financial solutions that feel personal, empowering, fast, and simple.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181003005311/en/\n\nPart of a new value-based relationship between Vancouver Clinic and Humana, the two new neighborhood clinics, operated by Vancouver Clinic, will accept all Humana Medicare Advantage HMO and PPO plans offered in Washington, as well as a new Dual Eligible Special Needs Plan (for patients qualifying for both Medicare and Medicaid) that will be available Jan. 1, 2019.\n\nThe first clinic is scheduled to open January 2019, located at 7809 NE Vancouver Plaza Drive in Vancouver. A second neighborhood clinic location will be added in the second half of 2019.\n\n\"Our community continues to grow and it's really important that we provide care close to where patients live,\" said Mark Mantei, Vancouver Clinic CEO. \"The neighborhood clinics we are opening will bring healthcare resources closer to patients and will offer integrated care teams that include doctors, nurses, health coaches, nutritionists, medication management, and social services resources who will help guide patients through the complex health system and ensure their care addresses the whole person.\"\n\nTo help its Medicare Advantage members achieve better health, Humana is adding these new Vancouver Clinic primary care practice locations to its network to improve access to care and quality of care.\n\n\"Vancouver Clinic has a long history of providing primary care to the residents of Vancouver and looking for ways to better meet the needs of the community and its patients. That is why we are excited to take our relationship from traditional to value-based care to better serve our members,\" said Catherine Field, Intermountain Region President for Humana. \"As people with Medicare age, they often have varying needs.

                "body": "Mastermind Marketing (OTC Pink: MMND), a leading involvement marketing agency developed and executed a YouTube Influencer Marketing campaign through Technology and Automotive channels for the Exxon\u0099Mobil\u0099 Speedpass+\u0099 app. The campaign has generated almost 1 million user engagements, substantial traffic to campaign landing pages, as well as App Store\u0099 and Google Play\u0099 downloads to date.\n\nThe campaign was aimed at raising awareness of the features and benefits of the app including being able to pay at the pump, and also apply for the ExxonMobil\u0099 Smart Card (which is fully integrated within the app). Carefully curated influencers with YouTube Technology and Automotive channels were selected to reach early adopters and automotive enthusiasts. Each selected influencer talked about the benefits and key features of the app and an actual demonstration at the pump.\n\nThe Exxon\u0099Mobil\u0099 Speedpass+\u0099 app appeared on the screen when the app was discussed/demonstrated, and each influencer invited consumers to visit their custom landing page to see other special offers and benefits of the card and app. To date, the program has generated approximately one million consumer engagements, significant traffic to each of the custom influencer landing pages, and a sizeable number of app downloads and card applications. This has produced significant positive results at the pump that will continue to grow since the influencer content is evergreen (always there).\n\nMastermind developed all aspects of the Exxon\u0099Mobil\u0099 Speedpass+\u0099 app campaign including planning, influencer sourcing and activation, influencer agreements/legal approvals, content/creative development, production coordination and supervision of Influencer references to the app/card, landing page design and development, result tracking, and the ROI model development.\n\nDaniel Dodson, CEO of Mastermind stated, \"The Exxon\u0099Mobil\u0099 Speedpass+\u0099 app is truly an innovative and useful tool for anyone that drives a car. Its features and benefits are best communicated by seeing an actual demonstration by one of the trusted sources like the Influencers selected. The Influencer Marketing program that we developed and executed proved highly effective at demonstrating the features & benefits, and also obtaining consumer adoption. Curating and activating groups of content-relevant Influencers with engaged subscriber bases are key ingredients for successful campaigns like this.\" In addition to automotive and technology, Mastermind has developed successful Influencer campaigns for other verticals including home improvement, agriculture, healthcare, pets, consumer packaged goods and a host of others.\n\n\"We look at Influencer Marketing three ways. 1. Paid - where we activate the right influencers and compensate them for integrating our client's brand. 2. Earned - where we provide influencers with exclusive content, access, and inside perspectives for them to include in the content they distribute. 3. Owned - empowering employees, dealers, distributors, and franchisees to share content on their personal social channels - this requires specific corporate guideline development, training, and vetted content libraries. Each can be hugely successful in the right environment,\" stated Michael Gelfond, EVP of Mastermind.\n\nAbout Mastermind, Inc.\n\nMastermind provides thinking that drives results for leading marketers.

                "title": "Garmin\u00ae and Marvel introduce the v\u00edvofit\u00ae jr. 2 kid's fitness tracker and interactive mobile app featuring Marvel's Spider-Man",
                "body": "Garmin International, Inc., a unit of Garmin Ltd. (NASDAQ: GRMN), today announced the v\u00edvofit jr. 2 kid's fitness tracker with Marvel's Spider-Man themed bands and mobile app. So much more than a fitness device, the v\u00edvofit jr. 2 provides kids with an interactive experience where activity unlocks adventure, shaping habits for lifelong health and fitness. In an engaging, comic book-style Spider-Verse app experience, kids will look forward to crushing activity minute goals to unlock new adventures, games, gems and step icons. Enhanced animations make New York City come to life with fun fitness facts integrated into the story to further encourage building healthy habits. With two ultra-durable, etched Marvel Spider-Man designs, v\u00edvofit jr. 2 bands are swim-friendly, feature a customizable color screen, and most important of all, boast a battery life of over a year. See the v\u00edvofit jr. 2 in action here.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180920005034/en/\n\n\"The Spider-Man experience, both the band and the mobile app adventure, lets kids dive into the imaginary Super Hero world through physical activity,\" said Dan Bartel, Garmin vice president of global consumer sales. \"With the v\u00edvofit jr. 2, kids get to 'Be the Hero' on the playground, and are incentivized to keep moving as their activity goals unlock new worlds within the Spider-Verse app experience. We're excited to add Spider-Man to our lineup of Disney, Avengers and Star Wars bands and app storylines.\"\n\n\"With an all-new hit console video game and feature film - it's a big year for our favorite web-slinging Super Hero,\" said Kyle Laughlin, Senior Vice President, Games and Interactive Experiences, Disney Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products. \"Marvel's Spider-Man is a great addition to our successful line of characters and stories that are inspiring kids to get active.\"\n\nThe Spider-Man v\u00edvofit jr. 2 is brought to life through a corresponding app adventure, which kids explore with the help of their parents. In Web Warriors: A Spider-Man Adventure, kids will unfold new adventures and explore different dimensions of the Spider-Verse. They'll soar high above the city alongside Spider-Man, fight Vulture with the help of unexpected allies, and track down the Green Goblin once and for all. The more they meet - and exceed - their activity goals, the more of the story they'll get to see. In addition to uncovering additional adventures with Marvel's Spider-Man, kids can gain access to fun games and more. To collect gems and get more chances to play games, kids will need to keep logging those active minutes.\n\nThe v\u00edvofit jr. 2 is a valuable tool for parents as well and comes with a companion app that acts as a parental personal assistant. From their compatible smart device, parents can view their child's activity, assign chores, and schedule reminder alerts that show up on their child's device. Task timers help kids know how much time they have left for each chore. For added incentivization, when kids receive and complete a given chore, parents can reward them with virtual coins that can be redeemed for agreed-upon rewards. The app allows for multiple profiles, so parents and siblings with compatible Garmin devices can have their steps listed on the step leaderboard, promoting a healthy and fit lifestyle for the whole family.\n\nIn addition to tracking steps, sleep and active minutes, kids can also use the v\u00edvofit jr. 2 to engage in some friendly competition with their friends and family. Toe-to-Toe\u0099 step challenges let kids sync with nearby friends (or themselves) for timed step competitions. Parents can also play by downloading the Toe-to-Toe Connect IQ\u0099 app to a compatible device. New family challenges let users connect with other families and compete in weekly step challenges for extra motivation to move.\n\nThe v\u00edvofit jr. 2 featuring Marvel's Spider-Man is available for purchase at Garmin.com and has a suggested retail price of $79.99. With v\u00edvofit jr. 2, the adventure never ends. By swapping out their band with an accessory band (sold separately, SRP $29.99), kids can open up a whole new world of adventure with Disney Princess, Star Wars, Minnie Mouse, and Avengers band options.\n\nThe ever-expanding Garmin fitness segment develops technologies to enhance and promote healthy and active lifestyles. Whether users are runners, cyclists, swimmers, multi-sport athletes, or simply looking to stay active throughout the day, there is a Garmin product that can help them reach their health and fitness goals.\n\nFor decades, Garmin has pioneered new devices and applications that are designed for people who live an active lifestyle. Garmin serves five primary business units, including automotive, aviation, fitness, marine, and outdoor recreation.

                "title": "Statement by Commissioner Vestager on Commission decision that the non-taxation of certain McDonald's profits in Luxembourg is not illegal State aid",
                "body": "The Commission has today decided that the non-taxation of certain McDonald's profits in Luxembourg is not illegal State aid.\n\nOur case concerned two tax rulings granted by Luxembourg to McDonald's in 2009. These exempt from taxation in Luxembourg all franchise profits that McDonald's receives from third parties operating McDonald's outlets in Europe, the Ukraine and Russia. In the first ruling, Luxembourg falsely assumed that these profits were taxable in the US. They were not. In the second ruling, Luxembourg then removed any obligation on McDonald's to prove that the revenues were taxable in the US. This means that these profits were neither taxed in Luxembourg nor the US.\n\nThe Commission investigated under EU State aid rules whether this double non-taxation was the result of Luxembourg misapplying its national laws and the Luxembourg-US Double Taxation Treaty, in favour of McDonald's. EU State aid rules prevent Member States from giving unfair advantages only to selected companies, including through illegal tax benefits.\n\nHowever, our in-depth investigation has shown that the reason for double non-taxation in this case is a mismatch between Luxembourg and US tax laws, and not a special treatment by Luxembourg. Therefore, we concluded that Luxembourg did not break EU State aid rules.\n\nDetails of the McDonald's structure\n\nFirst, let me tell you a bit more about the facts of the case.\n\nOur case concerns McDonald's Europe Franchising, a Luxembourg-based subsidiary of the McDonald's Corporation. This company also has a branch in the US.\n\nMcDonald's Europe Franchising owns the rights to the McDonald's brand and other related rights. It licenses these rights to third parties, who operate the McDonald's fast food outlets and pay franchise fees to McDonald's Europe Franchising.\n\nIn February 2009, McDonald's Europe Franchising contacted the Luxembourg tax authorities to ask for a tax ruling confirming that profits from its franchise rights would not be taxable in Luxembourg. McDonald's claimed that this was because these rights are attributed to its US branch. It further argued that the Luxembourg - US Double Taxation Treaty exempts from taxation in Luxembourg any income that may be taxed in the US, if the company has a taxable presence there, for example through a branch.\n\nIn March 2009, the Luxembourg authorities issued a first tax ruling agreeing to McDonald's interpretation of the Double Taxation Treaty. At the same time, they requested that the company provide proof that the income of the US branch had been declared and could indeed be taxed in the US.\n\nHowever, six months later, the Luxembourg tax authorities issued a second tax ruling that removed this requirement to submit proof. In other words, Luxembourg confirmed that the income is exempt from taxation in Luxembourg as well, even though it is not taxable at the US branch.\n\nThe State aid investigation\n\nYou may wonder how Luxembourg can rely on a Treaty meant to avoid double taxation to endorse double non-taxation. We asked ourselves the same question, which is why we opened a State aid investigation in December 2015.\n\nThe purpose of such investigations is to give the Member State and company concerned, as well as other third parties, the opportunity to submit their views on the Commission's preliminary concerns. We then carefully assess them.\n\nThe short summary of our conclusion in this case is that the Double Taxation Treaty between Luxembourg and the US explains Luxembourg's tax treatment of McDonald's. Luxembourg did not misapply the Treaty in a selective manner and, on that basis, did not break EU State aid rules.\n\nThe more complicated answer starts with a taxation concept called \"permanent establishment\". If a company has a \"permanent establishment\" in a specific country, this means that it carries out business and has a taxable presence there.\n\nThe Luxembourg - US Double Taxation Treaty says that Luxembourg cannot tax the profits of companies, if they may be taxed in the US because they have a permanent establishment there. Luxembourg can assume that the income of this permanent establishment is taxed in the US.\n\nHowever, whether a permanent establishment exists in the US is assessed differently by the US and by the Luxembourg tax authorities, under their respective tax codes.\n\nThe US did not consider the US branch of McDonald's Europe Franchising to be a permanent establishment under its tax law, and so did not tax the profits of this US branch. However, the Luxembourg authorities considered that the same US branch fulfilled all the conditions necessary to be a permanent establishment under Luxembourg tax law. It therefore exempted this income from Luxembourg taxation in line with the Double Taxation Treaty.\n\nThe result was double non-taxation of the income by Luxembourg and the US. However, this was not due to any special treatment awarded by Luxembourg to McDonald's, which was the issue that our investigation under EU State aid rules focused on. In other words, Luxembourg's tax treatment of McDonald's is not illegal under EU State aid rules.\n\nAs usual, we will publish the non-confidential version of our decision as soon as we have agreed with Luxembourg on any business secrets that need to be removed from it.\n\nNew Luxembourg tax rules\n\nOf course, the fact remains that McDonald's did not pay any taxes in Luxembourg on these profits - and this is not how it should be from a tax fairness point of view.\n\nThat's why I very much welcome that the Luxembourg Government is taking legislative steps to address the issue that arose in this case and avoid such situations in the future.\n\nAmong other things, Luxembourg will strengthen the criteria under its tax code to define a permanent establishment. This proposal is currently with the Luxembourg parliament. Once adopted, the new provision will require the taxpayer, in certain circumstances, to provide a certificate of residence in the other country, if it wants to benefit from a tax exemption in Luxembourg. This would be proof that the other country recognises the existence of a taxable permanent establishment of that company. This new provision is presented to the Luxembourg parliament together with other measures to transpose the EU's Anti-Tax-Avoidance Directive.\n\nOver the past few years, we have seen an international determination to deal with the issue of tax avoidance. Through closing loopholes in tax laws and working on the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project.\n\nAlso within the EU, under the responsibility of my colleagues Valdis Dombrovskis and Pierre Moscovici, the Commission has pursued a coherent strategy towards fair taxation and greater transparency. And Member States have been using the momentum to reform their corporate taxation framework, to make it both fairer and more efficient.\n\nProgress on recovery cases\n\nFinally, I would like to update you on significant progress made on the implementation of Commission decisions requiring Member States to recover unpaid taxes. This is important because otherwise companies continue to benefit from an illegal advantage.\n\nIn May, Luxembourg completed the recovery of more than 280 million euros from Amazon, of which 21 million euros is interest.\n\nI am also happy to confirm that Ireland has now recovered the full illegal aid from Apple. The final amount recovered is 14.3 billion euros, of which about 1.2 billion euros is interest. This money will be held in an escrow account, pending the outcome of the ongoing appeal of the Commission's decision before the EU courts. This means that we can proceed to closing the infringement procedure against Ireland for failure to implement the decision.\n\nThese are important steps forward to tackling multinationals' tax avoidance and to meeting our ultimate goal of ensuring that all companies, big or small, pay their fair share of tax in the future.",

C'est la troisi\u00e8me fois depuis 2015 que le plan Juncker apporte son concours aux activit\u00e9s de RDI de Grifols.

The Commission concluded that the merger would not adversely affect competition in the European Economic Area (EEA) or any substantial part of it. Today's decision follows an in-depth investigation of Apple's proposed acquisition of Shazam. Apple operates \"Apple Music\", which is the second largest music streaming service in Europe, after Spotify. Shazam offers a leading music recognition application in the EEA and worldwide. Apple and Shazam mainly offer complementary services and do not compete with each other. The Commission concluded that the transaction would raise no competition concerns in the EEA or any substantial part of it. A merger decision does not release companies from respecting all relevant data protection laws. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \"Data is key in the digital economy. We must therefore carefully review transactions which lead to the acquisition of important sets of data, including potentially commercially sensitive ones, to ensure they do not restrict competition. After thoroughly analysing Shazam's user and music data, we found that their acquisition by Apple would not reduce competition in the digital music streaming market.\" A full press release is available in EN, FR, DE.

('IFF') of the US. Frutarom develops, produces, and markets taste and health products, including flavours, fine ingredients, pharmaceutical/nutraceutical products, and cosmetics and personal care products. IFF is active in the development, creation and sale of flavours and fragrances that are used in consumer goods industries. The Commission concluded that the proposed transaction would raise no competition concerns under any plausible market definition in Europe, given the moderate overlaps and vertical links between the companies' activities, and the very limited increments in the levels of concentration brought about by the transaction. Moreover, after the transaction, a number of strong players would remain in the market. The transaction was examined under the simplified merger review procedure. More information is available on the Commission's competition website, in the public case register under the case number M.8981.

                "body": "The European Commission has approved under the EU Merger Regulation the proposed acquisition of Shazam by Apple. The Commission concluded that the merger would not adversely affect competition in the European Economic Area or any substantial part of it.\n\nCommissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \"Data is key in the digital economy. We must therefore carefully review transactions which lead to the acquisition of important sets of data, including potentially commercially sensitive ones, to ensure they do not restrict competition. After thoroughly analysing Shazam's user and music data, we found that their acquisition by Apple would not reduce competition in the digital music streaming market.\"\n\nToday's decision follows an in-depth investigation of Apple's proposed acquisition of Shazam. Apple operates \"Apple Music\", which is the second largest music streaming service in Europe, after Spotify. Shazam offers a leading music recognition application (\"app\") in the European Economic Area (EEA) and worldwide.\n\nApple and Shazam mainly offer complementary services and do not compete with each other. The Commission opened an in-depth investigation to assess:\n\nThe Commission undertook a wide range of investigative measures and received feedback from key market participants in the digital music industry, including providers of music streaming and music recognition services, as well as other stakeholders.\n\nThe Commission found that:\n\nTherefore, the Commission concluded that the transaction would raise no competition concerns in the EEA or any substantial part of it. A merger decision does not release companies from respecting all relevant data protection laws.\n\nCompanies and products\n\nApple is a US based global technology company which designs, manufactures and sells mobile communication, media devices, portable digital music players and personal computers. It also sells and delivers digital content online and offers the music and video streaming service ''Apple Music''.\n\nShazam is a UK based developer and distributor of music recognition applications for smartphones, tablets and PCs. It mainly generates revenues from online advertising, and commissions earned on referrals of users to digital music streaming and download services, such as Apple Music, Spotify and Deezer.\n\nOn 6 February 2018, the Commission accepted a request from Austria, France, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Spain and Sweden to assess the acquisition of Shazam by Apple under the EU Merger Regulation. The proposed transaction was initially notified to Austria for regulatory clearance, as the transaction did not meet the turnover thresholds of the EU Merger Regulation. Austria submitted a referral request to the Commission pursuant to Article 22(1) of the EU Merger Regulation on 21 December 2017.\n\nThe Commission has the duty to assess mergers and acquisitions involving companies with a turnover above certain thresholds (see Article 1 of the Merger Regulation) and to prevent concentrations that would significantly impede effective competition in the EEA or any substantial part of it.\n\nThe vast majority of notified mergers do not pose competition problems and are cleared after a routine review. From the moment a transaction is notified, the Commission generally has 25 working days to decide whether to grant approval (Phase I) or to start an in-depth investigation (Phase II).",

                "title": "TomTom Go Essential: Powerful Navigation Seamlessly Integrated with Smartphone",
                "body": "TomTom (TOM2) today announced the launch of the TomTom GO Essential - a feature-packed, connected sat nav with hands-free calling, voice control, compatibility with Siri voice recognition software and Google Now\u0099 service, fully interactive screen and a magnetic mount. Also included are Lifetime* Europe Maps and Traffic updates, with a six-month trial of TomTom Speed Cameras, making it easy to stay up to date on new roads and helping the driver to avoid traffic and fines.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180829005811/en/\n\nThe all new TomTom GO Essential is a powerful yet easy-to-use navigation device that seamlessly integrates with a smartphone. The built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae means that drivers no longer need to connect to a computer to get the latest maps and software updates. In addition, by connecting to a smartphone, the new TomTom GO Essential makes driving safer with hands-free calling, compatibility with Siri and Google Now\u0099 and reading aloud smartphone notifications such as text messages. It also is a smart-learning device that recognises driving habits to predict when a driver is going to frequent destinations saved in My Places.\n\nMike Schoofs, Managing Director, TomTom Consumer, comments: \"Hot on the heels of the launch of the TomTom GO Basic, the TomTom GO Essential is the second product in our new simplified product line-up. With this introduction, we are now able to offer a better-connected driving experience, pre-planning capabilities, and TomTom Road Trips inspiration to a broader audience.\"\n\nThe TomTom GO Essential opens the world to the route sharing community TomTom Road Trips, a free platform which lets travellers discover the most epic driving routes, and personalize it with their own adventures up mountains, along coastal roads, into forests and beyond. TomTom Road Trips works seamlessly with TomTom MyDrive, TomTom's existing online route planner. With TomTom MyDrive drivers can pick a route and search for locations on their smartphone or computer and sync it with their sat nav so they are ready to explore the world.\n\nThe 5\" or 6\" fully-interactive touchscreen TomTom GO Essential is available in Europe on TomTom's online store and at selected e-tailers from today, and in-store from beginning-October for \u0080199.95 (5\") / \u0080249.95 (6\").\n\nSiri is a trademark of Apple Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries.\n\nGoogle Now is a trademark of Google LLC.\n\n*Lifetime is the useful life of the device, which means the period of time that TomTom continues to support a device with either software updates, services, content or accessories. A device will have reached the end of its useful life when one or more is no longer available or if no updates have been downloaded to the device for a period of 36 months or more.

                "body": "Garmin International, Inc., a unit of Garmin Ltd. (NASDAQ: GRMN), today announced the v\u00edvofit jr. 2 kid's fitness tracker with Disney Princess-themed bands and mobile app. So much more than a fitness device, the v\u00edvofit jr. 2 provides kids with an interactive experience where activity unlocks adventure, shaping habits for lifelong health and fitness. Kids will look forward to crushing activity minute goals to unlock app adventures, games and step icons featuring Disney Princess characters Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, Mulan and Rapunzel. With two Princess-inspired design options, v\u00edvofit jr. 2 bands are swim-friendly, feature a customizable color screen, and most important of all, boast a battery life of over a year. See the v\u00edvofit jr. 2 in action here.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180822005062/en/\n\n\"We are excited to once again bring the Disney magic to our wearables lineup with these new Princess-inspired fitness trackers,\" said Dan Bartel, Garmin vice president of global consumer sales. \"The Play like a Princess campaign celebrates kids who aren't afraid to be bold, be daring, be kind and be different. It's our hope to inspire and empower kids to do something cool, find adventure, and above all, keep moving.\"\n\n\"Based on the initial success we've seen with Star Wars, Minnie Mouse, and Marvel Avengers on the v\u00edvofit jr. 2, we know that pairing Disney's unrivaled characters and content with Garmin wearables encourages kids to get active,\" said Kyle Laughlin, Senior Vice President, Games and Interactive Experiences, Disney Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products. \"The Disney Princesses make a great addition to this line and their stories make for exciting interactive adventures.\"\n\nThe Disney Princess-branded v\u00edvofit jr.2 is brought to life through a corresponding app adventure, which kids explore with the help of their parents. In Magical Kingdoms: A Disney Princess Adventure, kids will help Rapunzel and Flynn Rider escape Mother Gothel, save the Emperor with Mulan, and even explore the Cave of Wonders with Jasmine. The more they meet - and exceed - their activity goals, the more of the story they'll get to see. In addition to uncovering additional adventures with the Disney Princesses, kids can gain access to fun games and more. To collect gems and get more chances to play games, kids will need to keep logging those active minutes.\n\nThe v\u00edvofit jr. 2 is a valuable tool for parents as well, and comes with a companion app that acts as a parental personal assistant. From their compatible smart device, parents can view their child's activity, assign chores, and schedule reminder alerts that show up on their child's device. Task timers help kids know how much time they have left for each chore. For added incentivization, when kids receive and complete a given chore, parents can reward them with virtual coins that can be redeemed for agreed-upon rewards. The app allows for multiple profiles so parents and siblings with compatible Garmin devices can have their steps listed on the step leaderboard, promoting a healthy and fit lifestyle for the whole family.\n\nIn addition to tracking steps, sleep and active minutes, kids can also use the v\u00edvofit jr. 2 to engage in some friendly competition with their friends and family. Toe-to-Toe step challenges let kids sync with nearby friends (or themselves) for timed step competitions. Parents can also play by downloading the Toe-to-Toe Connect IQ app to a compatible device. New family challenges let users connect with other families and compete in weekly step challenges for extra motivation to move.\n\nThe v\u00edvofit jr. 2 featuring Disney Princess is available for purchase at retailers nationwide, including Best Buy and Target, and has a suggested retail price of $79.99. With v\u00edvofit jr. 2, the adventure never ends. By swapping out their band with an accessory band (sold separately, SRP $29.99), kids can open up a whole new world of adventure with Star Wars, Minnie Mouse, and Marvel Avengers band options.\n\nThe ever-expanding Garmin fitness segment develops technologies to enhance and promote healthy and active lifestyles. Whether users are runners, cyclists, swimmers, multi-sport athletes, or simply looking to stay active throughout the day, there is a Garmin product that can help them reach their health and fitness goals.\n\nFor decades, Garmin has pioneered new devices and applications that are designed for people who live an active lifestyle. Garmin serves five primary business units, including automotive, aviation, fitness, marine, and outdoor recreation.

                "title": "MedMen Releases Preliminary Fourth Quarter 2018 Systemwide Retail Revenue Results",
                "body": "MedMen Enterprises Inc. (\"MedMen\" or the \"Company\") (CSE: MMEN) (OTCQB: MMNFF) (FSE: A2JM6N) announced today unaudited systemwide retail revenue for its fiscal 2018 fourth quarter ended June 30, 2018. Across the Company's operations in California, Nevada and New York, systemwide retail revenue was US$19.2 million (CA$25.2 million). The Company is expected to post its audited fiscal 2018 full year results in October.\n\nStrong systemwide retail revenue for the quarter is primarily attributable to MedMen's stores in Southern California's recreational market. Excluding its Abbot Kinney store, which opened in early June of this year, the Company's other 7 retail locations reported a combined US$17.4 million in revenue (CA$22.8 million), with an average retail markup over wholesale of 90%. These 7 locations saw 94,000 new customers and nearly 130,000 returning customers, with an average spend per transaction of US$77.76 (CA$102.09), operating at an annualized per square foot revenue of US$6,541 (CA$8,470). By comparison, according to CoStar, the average sales per square foot for an Apple store is approximately US$5,546 (CA$7,282) and approximately US$2,951 (CA$3,875) for Tiffany & Co stores.\n\nMedMen continued to expand its operations in Nevada, successfully opening its first branded store in downtown Las Vegas in July and recently won approval to operate a second location near the Hard Rock Hotel, the Thomas and Mack Center and McCarran International Airport, set to open in October.\n\n\"Retail is the key to the fast-evolving cannabis industry. It is where brands are built and where the margins can be maintained,\" said Adam Bierman, MedMen chief executive officer and co-founder. \"The rapid revenue growth in our California stores, only six months into recreational sales, is a solid reflection of our continued execution of our business thesis. We will remain focused on our strategy and the kind of growth that generates long-term value for our shareholders.\"\n\nIn conjunction with its growing retail footprint, MedMen's strategy is to complement its operations in every market with robust vertical integration with the objective of better margins and overall control of the supply chain. During the fourth quarter, the Company opened its Project Mustang, a 45,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art cultivation and manufacturing facility in northern Nevada. The same factory design is currently being built in Desert Hot Springs, California, with completion scheduled for early 2019. The Company plans to build the same factories in New York, where it currently holds one of 10 medical marijuana licenses, and, if it closes its proposed acquisition, near Orlando, Florida. MedMen announced in July that it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase a Florida license holder with a cultivation facility and rights to open 25 stores in that state.\n\nABOUT MEDMEN:\n\nMedMen Enterprises is a leading cannabis company in the U.S. with assets and operations across the country. Based in Los Angeles, MedMen brings expertise and capital to the cannabis industry and is one of the nation's largest financial supporters of progressive marijuana laws.

Among the key factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking information and statements are the following: failure to obtain all necessary approvals with respect to MedMen's proposed Florida acquisition, delays in opening new cultivation and manufacturing facilities, higher than expected costs to construct and operate cultivation and manufacturing facilities, adverse changes in the public perception of cannabis; changes in consumer demand for cannabis; decreases in the prevailing prices for cannabis and cannabis products in the markets in which the Company operates; adverse changes in applicable laws; adverse changes in the application or enforcement of current laws, including those related to taxation; increasing costs of compliance with extensive government regulation; changes in general economic, business and political conditions, including changes in the financial markets and in particular in the ability of the Company to raise debt and equity capital in the amounts and at the costs that it expects; risks related to licensing, including the ability to obtain the requisite licenses or renew existing licenses for the Company's proposed operations; dependence upon third party service providers skilled labor and key inputs for purposes for example facility design and construction activities; risks inherent in the agricultural business; intellectual property risks; risks related to litigation; dependence upon senior management. Should one or more of these risks, uncertainties or other factors materialize, or should assumptions underlying the forward-looking information or statements prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein as intended, planned, anticipated, believed, estimated or expected.\n\nAlthough MedMen believes that the assumptions and factors used in preparing, and the expectations contained in, the forward-looking information and statements are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on such information and statements, and no assurance or guarantee can be given that such forward-looking information and statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such information and statements. Key assumption used herein are that the revenue for the fourth quarter could be achieved in further quarterly periods over an annual period such that annualizing is reasonable; that vertical integration can be used to achieve cost efficiencies; that the Company has the requisite capabilities to execute on a vertical integration strategy; and that construction of new facilities will be on budget and not delayed. The forward-looking information and forward-looking statements contained in this press release are made as of the date of this press release, and MedMen does not undertake to update any forward-looking information and/or forward-looking statements that are contained or referenced herein, except in accordance with applicable securities laws. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking information and statements attributable to MedMen or persons acting on its behalf is expressly qualified in its entirety by this notice.",

                "body": "Einer der gro\u00dfen Treiber im S&P 500 sind demnach aktuell die Tech-Aktien. Obwohl einige gro\u00dfe Namen mit den Quartalszahlen entt\u00e4uschten, wie beispielsweise Facebook, und h\u00e4ufig eine Angst vor \u00dcberbewertung von Tech-Werten besteht, gibt es in diesem Sektor einige Unternehmen, die Anlegern das Gegenteil beweisen.\n\nReeves sieht eine \"generelle St\u00e4rke in diesem Sektor\". So zielten die Aktien im Bereich IT, die im S&P 500 gelistet sind, auf eine neues 52-Wochen-Hoch hin. 79 Prozent der Tech-Aktien schwebten momentan \u00fcber ihrem 200-Tages-Durchschnitt, 70 Prozent \u00fcber ihrem Durchschnitt der vergangenen 100 Tage.\n\nHier sollten nicht nur die gro\u00dfen Werte beachtet werden wie Apple oder Google-Mutter Alphabet, die momentan mit super Zahlen begeistern. Auch die kleineren Aktien im Tech-Bereich liefen aktuell gut. Reeves nennt beispielsweise Firmen, die sich mit Cloud-Anwendungen befassen, wie NetApp, das im vergangenen Jahr 50 Prozent Wachstum zeigte, oder mittelgro\u00dfe Softwareunternehmen, wie zum Beispiel CyberArk Software.\n\nDer zweite Bereich, der im S&P 500 eine gute Leistung zeigt, sind die langlebigen Konsumg\u00fcter. Konsumenten haben momentan viel Geld zur Verf\u00fcgung, das sie f\u00fcr solche G\u00fcter ausgeben k\u00f6nnen, was man auch an der guten Performance der Aktien in diesem Bereich sehen kann. Der Sektor im S&P 500 befindet sich in einem 52-Wochen-Hoch und beinahe 65 Prozent der enthaltenen Aktien sind \u00fcber ihrem 100-Tage-Durchschnitt.\n\nDas zeigt, dass nicht nur die gro\u00dfen Namen in diesem Bereich gut laufen, wie beispielsweise der E-Commerce-H\u00e4ndler Amazon, der auch einen gro\u00dfen Beitrag in diesem Sektor leistet, sondern alle Aktien, wie auch Reeves betont. Als gro\u00dfe Gewinner nennt der Analyst den Warenhausbetreiber Macy's und die Schnell-Restaurant-Kette Chipotle Mexican Grill, die im laufenden Jahr bereits gro\u00dfe Zuw\u00e4chse verzeichnen durften. Reeves ist der Meinung, dass man aktuell nicht gegen Werte im Bereich der langlebigen Konsumg\u00fcter wetten sollte, \"trotz irgendwelcher ausgedehnter Volatilit\u00e4t\".\n\nDer letzte Sektor im S&P 500, der momentan eine gute Leistung aufweist, ist der Versorgungsbereich. Reeves selbst sagt, dass es \"verr\u00fcckt\" klingt, den Versorger-Sektor als \"dynamisch\" zu bezeichnen, allerdings waren am vergangenen Freitag (10.08.2018) alle 29 Aktien in diesem Bereich \u00fcber ihrem 100-Tage-Durchschnitt.\n\nZw\u00f6lf der Aktien in diesem Bereich seien f\u00fcnf Prozent oder weniger weit entfernt von einem neuen 52-Wochen-Hoch, der Analyst nennt hier beispielsweise Exelon und FirstEnergy. Die meisten der Werte in diesem Bereich br\u00e4chten ihren Investoren Ertr\u00e4ge von drei bis vier Prozent ein. Zwar h\u00e4tten sie keinen Einfluss auf riskante Bereiche des Gesamtmarktes \"mit legalisierten Monopolen in den betreffenden Regionen und einer ziemlich stabilen Kundenbasis, die entweder mitmachen oder woanders hinziehen kann\". Allerdings seien sie aus diesem Grund auch unbeeinflusst von Problemen im weltpolitischen Kontext wie beispielsweise dem Handelskrieg zwischen den USA und China oder den Verstimmungen zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und der T\u00fcrkei.",

                "title": "TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index: IMX Remains Flat Despite Strong Market Performance in July",
                "body": "The July Investor Movement Index was unchanged from the prior month, remaining at 5.45, TD Ameritrade, Inc. announced today. The Investor Movement Index, or the IMX, is a proprietary, behavior-based index created by TD Ameritrade that aggregates Main Street investor positions and activity to measure what investors actually were doing and how they were positioned in the markets.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180806005440/en/\n\nJuly IMX\n\nThe July 2018 Investor Movement Index for the four weeks ended July 27, 2018 reveals:\n\nWith earnings as a key focus during the period, TD Ameritrade clients maintained their overall exposure to equity markets. Despite continued net buying activity, TD Ameritrade client accounts were offset by lower relative volatility in some widely held names, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and General Electric Company (GE), resulting in an unchanged IMX score.\n\n\"The start of earnings season had a definite effect on the stocks that our clients chose to buy and sell during the July period,\" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. \"It appears investors followed the traditional method of buying-low and selling-high, while staying invested in stocks that have better long term possibilities.\"\n\nTD Ameritrade clients were net buyers of popular stocks in the July IMX period. Top buys include:\n\nDespite being net buyers for another month, TD Ameritrade clients sold equities, including:\n\nMajor market indices moved higher in July, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and NASDAQ Composite all ending the period with healthy gains. More than 50 percent of S&P 500 companies reported earnings in July, and of those, 80 percent delivered positive earnings news. CEOs from nearly half of the companies that reported earnings mentioned U.S. tariffs on their earnings calls, which was prompted by the administration's decision to impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods. As July came to a close, geopolitical risk continued to be top-of-mind for investors along with seasonal risk as the markets headed into what is historically known as the worst time for stocks.\n\nAbout the IMX\n\nThe IMX value is calculated based on a complex proprietary formula. Each month, TD Ameritrade pulls a sample from its client base of more than 11 million funded accounts, which includes all accounts that completed a trade in the past month. The holdings and positions of this statistically significant sample are evaluated to calculate individual scores, and the median of those scores represents the monthly IMX.\n\nFor more information on the Investor Movement Index, including historical IMX data going back to January 2010; to view the full report from July 2018; or to sign up for future IMX news alerts, please visit www.tdameritrade.com/IMX. Additionally, TD Ameritrade clients can chart the IMX using the symbol $IMX in either the thinkorswim or TD Ameritrade Mobile Trader platforms.\n\nInclusion of specific security names in this commentary does not constitute a recommendation from TD Ameritrade to buy, sell, or hold.\n\nPast performance of a security, strategy, or index is no guarantee of future results or investment success.\n\nHistorical data should not be used alone when making investment decisions. Please consult other sources of information and consider your individual financial position and goals before making an independent investment decision.\n\nThe IMX is not a tradable index. The IMX should not be used as an indicator or predictor of future client trading volume or financial performance for TD Ameritrade.\n\nFor the latest TD Ameritrade news and information, follow the company on Twitter, @TDAmeritradePR.\n\nTD Ameritrade provides investing services and education to more than 11 million client accounts totaling more than $1.2 trillion in assets, and custodial services to more than 6,000 registered investment advisors.

                "title": "MoviePass Accelerates Plan For Profitability",
                "body": "MoviePass\u0099, the nation's premier movie theater subscription service and a majority-owned subsidiary of Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc. (Nasdaq: HMNY) (\"Helios\"), today announced the implementation of several new measures aimed at accelerating the plan for profitability. Through these new steps, the company believes it will be able to compress its timeline to reach profitability.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180731005582/en/\n\nApproaching the one-year anniversary of introducing its standard $9.95 price point, the MoviePass community has grown to more than 3 million members and in turn has contributed to record box office growth, responsible for approximately 6 percent of the nation's total box office sales in the first half of 2018. In addition, MoviePass Ventures and MoviePass Films are contributing to the company's ancillary revenue.\n\nToday, the company has implemented several elements of a long-term growth plan to protect the existing community and set it up for future sustainable growth.\n\nMoviePass has implemented several new cost-reduction and subscription revenue increase measures:\n\nAs of Q3 and beyond, MoviePass is also generating incremental non-subscription revenue of approximately $4 to $6 per subscriber per quarter:\n\nIntegration of MoviePass Ventures and MoviePass Films with our own original content allows us to gain revenue by owning the films through box office, streaming, DVD, retail, transactional sales e.g. Apple and Samsung, and international rights, etc.\n\nIn an effort to maintain the integrity of the MoviePass mission, to enhance discovery, and to drive attendance to smaller films and bolster the independent film community, MoviePass will begin to limit ticket availability to Blockbuster films. This change has already begun rolling out, with Mission Impossible 6 being the first film included in the measure. This is a strategic move by the company to both limit cash burn and stay loyal to its mission to empower the smaller artistic film communities. Major studios will continue to be able to partner with MoviePass to promote their first run films, seeding them with a valuable moviegoing audience.\n\nMoviePass subscribers are also more readily influenced by recommendations and more willing to make them, making them an invaluable audience to studios and distributors. The National Research Group study indicates that when we recommend films, partner with studios, or promote our own movies, we currently account for 20% to 45% of the national box office.\n\n\"Over the past year, we challenged an entrenched industry while maintaining the financially transparent records of a publicly traded company. We believe that the measures we began rolling out last week will immediately reduce cash burn by 60% and will continue to generate lower funding needs in the future,\" said Ted Farnsworth, Chairman and CEO of Helios.\n\n\"These changes are meant to protect the longevity of our company and prevent abuse of the service. While no one likes change, these are essential steps to continue providing the most attractive subscription service in the industry. Our community has shown an immense amount of enthusiasm over the past year, and we trust that they will continue to share our vision to reinvigorate the movie industry,\" said Mitch Lowe, MoviePass CEO.\n\nAbout Helios and Matheson Analytics\n\nHelios and Matheson Analytics Inc. (Nasdaq:HMNY) (\"Helios\") is a provider of information technology services and solutions, offering a range of technology platforms focusing on big data, artificial intelligence, business intelligence, social listening, and consumer-centric technology.

                "body": "LSC Communications, Inc. (NYSE: LKSD), a leader in traditional and digital printing solutions, announced today an equity investment and the signing of a definitive reseller agreement with MAZ Systems Incorporated. MAZ is a New York City-based content logistics company that enables brands, media and publishers to publish any content to various output channels, including mobile applications, OTT (over-the-top), social media, video and news aggregators, gaming consoles, voice assistants, wearable technology and more.\n\nFounded in 2010 by former Apple and Adobe designers and engineers, MAZ launched the world's first Content Logistics System to solve the issue that many companies face of delivering their content to an ever-growing and unscalable list of social platforms, devices and operating systems. Most companies solve these content logistics problems by hiring developers to manually build out each distribution output one by one, only to find themselves needing to build again and again as new output types inevitably emerge.\n\nMAZ, a cloud-based software suite, manages the processing, filtering, packaging, and shipping of content to current and emerging outputs, all from a single dashboard, at a fraction of the cost. MAZ is used by brands like Forbes, Fast Company, Cond\u00e9 Nast, American Media, Inc., USA Today, Outside TV, and hundreds of others.\n\nLSC will harness MAZ's technology to complement and expand its legacy platform to expose clients to new distribution solutions that help streamline and accelerate their business strategies beyond print. \"The investment in MAZ signals our desire to strengthen LSC's leadership position in content logistics, distribution and monetization across all formats, channels and platforms,\" said Chris W. Schraft, President of Business Development at LSC. \"MAZ's state-of-the-art solution set and technology platform provide natural alignment with where we're taking the business. We look forward to helping our publishing and marketing clients go beyond print and effectively navigate the complexities of the new media landscape as they look to reach and engage their desired audiences across an ever-expanding array of digital endpoints.\"\n\n\"There is a clear alignment in our strategic visions of the future,\" said Paul Canetti, CEO of MAZ. \"LSC is a leader in traditional content distribution and logistics, and we have built a parallel infrastructure for digital content. This investment will empower us to bring our Content Logistics System to the next generation of content creators, who will be distributing not only across the devices and platforms we use today, but to all the emerging distribution outputs of the future.\"\n\nAbout MAZ\n\nMAZ is The Content Logistics Company. Brands and media companies like Forbes, Fast Company, Cond\u00e9 Nast, American Media Inc., USA Today, Outside TV, and hundreds of others use MAZ to process, curate, publish, and monetize their content to audiences across mobile, social media, TV, voice assistants, and more.\n\nMAZ has processed and published over half a billion pieces of content to millions of users across 200+ countries. The company has been selected as one of Inc. Magazine's \"Best Workplaces of 2018,\" Inc.'s \"30 Under 30 - America's Coolest Young Entrepreneurs,\" and one of Entrepreneur Magazine's \"Best Entrepreneurial Companies in America.\"\n\nFor more information, visit our website at www.mazsystems.com\n\nAbout LSC Communications\n\nWith a rich history of industry experience, innovative solutions and service reliability, LSC Communications (NYSE: LKSD) is a global leader in print and digital media solutions. The company's traditional and digital print-related services and office products serve the needs of publishers, merchandisers and retailers around the world.

                "body": "TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (Nasdaq: AMTD) has released results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Earnings increased sequentially due to significant expense reductions. The Company gathered $20 billion in net new client assets for the quarter and reported client trading activity of approximately 784,000 client trades per day, on average.\n\nFinancial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, include the following:\n\n\"Thanks to outstanding operational and business performance, we delivered strong profitability in the quarter,\" said Tim Hockey, TD Ameritrade president and chief executive officer. \"We're on a mission to leverage our size, scale and know-how to make investing simpler and more personal than ever before. We rounded out our advice continuum in the third quarter with the launch of Personalized Portfolios - a compelling 'digital-plus-human' guidance experience. Additionally, our advanced technology efforts, such as Apple Business Chat, are gaining traction with clients and we will continue to expand the ways in which our clients can interact with us online. TD Ameritrade is leveraging technology and people to break down barriers, bringing greater ease and accessibility to investing. It's about what we offer, and how we offer it.\"\n\n\"It was an excellent quarter as substantial expense reductions drove record net income and EPS. Investor engagement was robust, with strong client net buying,\" said Steve Boyle, executive vice president and chief financial officer. \"At the same time, we're clearly seeing the expected benefits of our Scottrade acquisition. In fact, we achieved many cost savings sooner than expected, with approximately $212 million in synergies realized through June. The strength of these results more than offset a slight decline in trading revenue compared to the prior record quarter.\"\n\nCapital Management\n\nThe Company paid $119 million, or $0.21 per share, in cash dividends in its third fiscal quarter.\n\nThe Company has declared a $0.21 per share quarterly cash dividend, payable on August 21, 2018 to all holders of record of common stock as of August 7, 2018.\n\nAs of July 23, 2018, the Company has 26 million shares remaining for share repurchases under its stock repurchase program.\n\nCompany Hosts Conference Call\n\nTD Ameritrade will hold its June Quarter conference call tomorrow morning, July 24, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. EDT (7:30 a.m. CDT) to take questions from analysts.

These after-tax benefits were primarily attributable to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for which we recorded a provisional estimate for the remeasurement of our deferred income tax balances.\n\nNOTE: The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets include provisional estimates related to property acquired and liabilities assumed in the Scottrade acquisition. These provisional estimates may be prospectively adjusted in the event new information becomes available regarding facts and circumstances which existed at the date of acquisition.\n\nSee attached reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nIn June 2018, the presentation of the liquid assets metric was revised in order to provide a consolidated view of our liquidity, which management may utilize, as necessary, to meet corporate cash flow needs, fund potential operational contingencies and to support our business strategies. The prior period, which provided a view of our liquidity net of operational contingencies and other obligations, has been updated to conform to the current presentation.\n\nEffective in September 2017, the average commissions per trade metric was revised to exclude order routing revenue. Prior periods have been updated to conform to the current presentation.\n\nNOTE: See Glossary of Terms on the Company's website at www.amtd.com for definitions of the above metrics.\n\nNOTE: See Glossary of Terms on the Company's website at www.amtd.com for definitions of the above metrics.",

                "title": "Statement by Commissioner Vestager on Commission decision to fine Google \u20ac4.34 billion for illegal practices regarding Android mobile devices to strengthen dominance of Google's search engine",
                "body": "Today, the Commission has decided to fine Google 4.34 billion euros for breaching EU antitrust rules. Google has engaged in illegal practices to cement its dominant market position in internet search. It must put an effective end to this conduct within 90 days or face penalty payments.\n\nGoogle's search engine is its flagship product. Every year, Google generates more than 95 billion US dollars from adverts, such as those shown to and clicked on by users of Google Search. And much of this revenue is thanks to the rise of smart mobile devices, namely smartphones and tablets.\n\nToday, mobile internet makes up more than half of global internet traffic. It has changed the lives of millions of Europeans. No matter if we're waiting for the metro, sitting in a meeting room or discussing with friends at the dinner table - more and more our hands reach for our smartphones and tablets to find the information we are looking for.\n\nOur case is about three types of restrictions that Google has imposed on mobile device manufacturers and network operators to ensure that traffic goes to Google Search:\n\nIn this way, Google has used Android as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine.\n\nThese practices have denied rivals the chance to innovate and compete on the merits. They have denied European consumers the benefits of effective competition in the important mobile sphere. This is illegal under EU antitrust rules.\n\nGoogle understood early on that the shift from desktop to mobile internet, which started in the mid-2000s, would be a fundamental change for its search engine business. It realised that it was both an opportunity and a risk.\n\nSo, Google developed a strategy to anticipate the effects of the shift. This strategy was built on the mobile operating system Android. As Google said in one of its internal documents at the time - \"Android is by far the greatest opportunity for Search monetization in mobile over the next years and is very strategic to Google.\"\n\nGoogle bought the original developer of the Android operating system in 2005, and has continued to develop Android ever since. It has been very successful - today, around 80% of smart mobile devices in Europe and worldwide run on Android. That's more than 2.2 billion devices in total.\n\nEach time Google releases a new version of Android, it publishes the source code online. This, in principle, allows anyone to access and modify the code to create other versions of Android, so-called \"Android forks\".\n\nAt the same time, this openly accessible Android source code only covers basic functions of mobile devices. It does not include popular Google apps, like the Google Play Store, which enables users to download more than 3.3 million different apps.\n\nIf manufacturers want to sell Android devices that have popular Google apps, they need to agree to Google's terms and sign on the dotted line. This includes a requirement not to modify the Android source code without Google's consent. Through this requirement, in practice, Android is locked down in a Google-controlled ecosystem.\n\nWhat are the illegal restrictions Google put in place?\n\nOur case is about three specific types of restrictions Google has imposed on manufacturers and mobile network operators.\n\nThe first practice ensures that Android device manufacturers pre-install the Google Search app and Google's Chrome browser on the devices they sell. Search and browser apps are the most important gateways to reach search engines on mobile devices.\n\nManufacturers have to pre-install the Google Search and Chrome apps if they want to sell devices that offer users a key feature, namely the possibility to download other apps via the Google Play Store.\n\nAs part of our investigation, device manufacturers confirmed that users consider Google's Play Store a 'must-have' app on Android devices. So, the right to pre-install the Play Store on their devices is a very strong incentive for them to agree to Google's demands. Especially, because it is not possible for users to download the Play Store themselves.\n\nSecond, Google also wanted Google Search to be the only pre-installed search engine on Android devices. So Google gave some of the largest device manufacturers a share of the pie that is Google's search revenues on their devices, but only on condition of this exclusive status. It also entered into such arrangements with certain mobile network operators, which can also determine what apps are installed on devices they sell to consumers. At its peak, this practice covered more than 80% of Android devices sold in Europe. Google stopped this practice after the Commission started to look into it.\n\nOur investigation has shown that for search apps and mobile browsers, pre-installation on devices is an advantage that can't be matched in any other way. The figures speak for themselves: in 2016, more than 95% of all search queries on Android devices were made via Google Search. These devices had Google Search and Chrome pre-installed. On Windows Mobile devices, on the other hand, Google's search engine is not pre-installed. As a result, less than 25% of all search queries were made via Google Search. More than 75% of search queries happened on Bing, which is the pre-installed search engine on Windows Mobile devices.\n\nThere is a saying that you don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Well, the evidence shows that when it comes to search apps and mobile browsers, the vast majority of users simply take what comes on their device and do not download competing apps. In fact, these apps are not even for free, since users pay with their data. Or, to slightly paraphrase what also the economist Milton Friedman has said - \"there ain't no such thing as a free search\".\n\nThe third practice Google has put in place, as I already mentioned, prevents device manufacturers from using any alternative version of Android that was not approved by Google. If manufacturers produce even a single device based on an Android fork, they lose the right to sell any devices with the Google Play Store or the Google Search app. And this is how Google restricts the opportunity and incentive for others to develop Android forks - in a way that is not open at all. At the same time, this reduced the opportunity for rival search engines and others to launch apps and services on devices running on Android forks.\n\nThis was not just a remote possibility from the theory books: in 2012 and 2013, Amazon tried to license to device manufacturers its Android fork called \"Fire OS\". It wanted to cooperate with manufacturers to increase its chances of commercial success. And manufacturers were interested. But, due to Google's restrictions, manufacturers could not launch Fire OS on even a single device. They would have lost the right to sell any Android phones with key Google apps. Nowadays, very few devices run on Fire OS - namely, only those manufactured by Amazon itself.\n\nThis is not a proportionate outcome. Google is entitled to set technical requirements to ensure that functions and apps within its own Android ecosystem run smoothly. But these technical requirements cannot serve as a smoke-screen to prevent the development of competing Android ecosystems - Google can't have its cake and eat it.\n\nWhy are these practices illegal under EU rules?\n\nIn Europe, we congratulate all companies for the success they achieve through innovation and developing products that consumers value. That's why market dominance is, as such, not a problem under EU antitrust rules.\n\nBut with market dominance comes responsibility - that's because, when one company dominates a marketplace, competition is already weakened. So, EU antitrust rules put special responsibilities on dominant companies. They must not deny other companies the chance to compete on the merits, to the detriment of further innovation and European consumers.\n\nThrough its control over Android, Google is dominant in the market for mobile operating systems, which are available for licence to other manufacturers. Google has been dominant in this market since 2011. Our most recent figures show that it holds a market share of more than 95%. The second biggest player in the market, Windows Mobile, was very small in comparison. It had a share of less than 5%, before exiting the market last year.\n\nOther mobile operating systems, like those of Apple and Blackberry, are not available for licence. They do not directly compete with Android at the level of device manufacturers. Of course, Android phones compete with Apple and Blackberry phones for end consumers - but our investigation showed that this doesn't sufficiently constrain Google's power vis-\u00e0-vis device manufacturers and network operators.\n\nOur decision also concludes that Google is dominant in two other markets, namely app stores for the Android mobile operating system and in general internet search.\n\nAs regards app stores, Google Play Store accounts for more than 90% of app downloads on Android devices.\n\nAs regards general internet search, the Google search engine holds very high market shares of over 90% in most European countries. This we already showed in our Google Shopping Decision of last year.\n\nThis means that Google must comply with EU antitrust rules for dominant companies. Today's decision concludes that the restrictions Google imposed on manufacturers and network operators using Android have breached these rules since 2011.\n\nFirst, that's because Google's practices have denied rival search engines the possibility to compete on the merits. They make sure that Google's search engine is pre-installed on practically all Android devices, which is an advantage that cannot be matched. And by making payments to major manufacturers and network operators on condition that no other search engine was pre-installed, rivals were excluded from this opportunity. In this way, Google also denied rivals access to valuable data from increased user traffic, which in turn could have allowed rivals to improve their products.\n\nFurthermore, Google's practices also harmed competition and further innovation in the wider mobile space, beyond just internet search. That's because they prevented other mobile browsers from competing effectively with the pre-installed Google Chrome browser.\n\nAnd they obstructed the development of Android forks, which could have provided a platform for rival search engines as well as other app developers to thrive.\n\nWhat are the consequences of this decision?\n\nThe fine of 4.34 billion euros reflects the serious and sustained nature of Google's violations of EU antitrust rules. The decision requires Google to bring its illegal conduct to an end within 90 days, in an effective manner.\n\nAt a minimum, our decision requires Google to stop and to not re-engage in the three types of restrictions I have described. In other words, our decision stops Google from controlling which search and browser apps manufacturers can pre-install on Android devices, or which Android operating system they can adopt.\n\nBut it is Google's sole responsibility to make sure it changes its conduct in a way that brings the infringement to an effective end. We will monitor this very closely. If Google fails to achieve compliance with our decision, it would be subject to penalty payments. That penalty could be up to 5% of the average daily worldwide turnover of Alphabet, Google's parent, for each day of non-compliance. We would have to establish this in a separate Commission decision, with the penalty backdated to when the non-compliance started.\n\nSo, our decision requires Google to change the way it operates and face the consequences of its actions.\n\nOther Google cases\n\nAbout a year ago, I was here in the press room to tell you about a separate decision concerning Google. The Commission fined Google 2.42 billion euros for abusing its dominance as a search engine, by giving an illegal advantage to its own comparison shopping service. We have not yet taken a position on whether Google has complied with that decision. And since we haven't done so, this remains very much an open question.\n\nFurthermore, the Commission also continues to investigate Google's business practices concerning other vertical search services and AdSense. I cannot prejudge the outcome of these ongoing investigations, which continue to be top priorities for us.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhat our ongoing work and today's decision have in common is the principle that, in Europe, companies must compete on the merits. Any company is welcome to do business in our Single Market - but they need to play by EU antitrust rules that serve to protect European consumers and effective competition.\n\nThis matters, especially in digital markets. Technology companies have enormous potential to do us a lot of good. But establishing people's trust that the technology serves us, and not the other way round, is more important than ever.\n\nCompetition enforcement can make a difference here. It can give people confidence that technology companies play fair and do not close off markets to competition. Otherwise, they will be sanctioned - as Google was today.\n\nBut we also need effective regulation, including data protection rules that ensure our data is not being misused and rules that make sure online platforms operate in a transparent way.\n\nThat's why I work hand in hand with my colleagues Andrus Ansip, Mariya Gabriel and V\u0115ra Jourov\u00e1 to build the trust we need to make sure digital markets truly serve European consumers.",

                "title": "Antitrust: Commission fines Google \u20ac4.34 billion for illegal practices regarding Android mobile devices to strengthen dominance of Google's search engine",
                "body": "The European Commission has fined Google \u20ac4.34 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. Since 2011, Google has imposed illegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to cement its dominant position in general internet search.\n\nGoogle must now bring the conduct effectively to an end within 90 days or face penalty payments of up to 5% of the average daily worldwide turnover of Alphabet, Google's parent company.\n\nCommissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \"Today, mobile internet makes up more than half of global internet traffic. It has changed the lives of millions of Europeans. Our case is about three types of restrictions that Google has imposed on Android device manufacturers and network operators to ensure that traffic on Android devices goes to the Google search engine. In this way, Google has used Android as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine. These practices have denied rivals the chance to innovate and compete on the merits. They have denied European consumers the benefits of effective competition in the important mobile sphere. This is illegal under EU antitrust rules.\"\n\nIn particular, Google:\n\nGoogle's strategy and the scope of the Commission investigation\n\nGoogle obtains the vast majority of its revenues via its flagship product, the Google search engine. The company understood early on that the shift from desktop PCs to mobile internet, which started in the mid-2000s, would be a fundamental change for Google Search. So, Google developed a strategy to anticipate the effects of this shift, and to make sure that users would continue to use Google Search also on their mobile devices.\n\nIn 2005, Google bought the original developer of the Android mobile operating system and has continued to develop Android ever since. Today, about 80% of smart mobile devices in Europe, and worldwide, run on Android.\n\nWhen Google develops a new version of Android it publishes the source code online. This in principle allows third parties to download and modify this code to create Android forks. The openly accessible Android source code covers basic features of a smart mobile operating system but not Google's proprietary Android apps and services. Device manufacturers who wish to obtain Google's proprietary Android apps and services need to enter into contracts with Google, as part of which Google imposes a number of restrictions. Google also entered into contracts and applied some of these restrictions to certain large mobile network operators, who can also determine which apps and services are installed on devices sold to end users.\n\nThe Commission decision concerns three specific types of contractual restrictions that Google has imposed on device manufacturers and mobile network operators. These have enabled Google to use Android as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine. In other words, the Commission decision does not question the open source model or the Android operating system as such.\n\nGoogle's dominance\n\nThe Commission decision concludes that Google is dominant in the markets for general internet search services, licensable smart mobile operating systems and app stores for the Android mobile operating system.\n\nGeneral search services\n\nGoogle is dominant in the national markets for general internet search throughout the European Economic Area (EEA), i.e. in all 31 EEA Member States. Google has shares of more than 90% in most EEA Member States. There are high barriers to enter these markets. This has also been concluded in the Google Shopping decision of June 2017.\n\nSmart mobile operating systems available for licence\n\nAndroid is a licensable smart mobile operating system. This means that third party manufacturers of smart mobile devices can license and run Android on their devices.\n\nThrough its control over Android, Google is dominant in the worldwide market (excluding China) for licensable smart mobile operating systems, with a market share of more than 95%. There are high barriers to entry in part due to network effects: the more users use a smart mobile operating system, the more developers write apps for that system - which in turn attracts more users. Furthermore, significant resources are required to develop a successful licensable smart mobile operating system.\n\nAs a licensable operating system, Android is different from operating systems exclusively used by vertically integrated developers (like Apple iOS or Blackberry). Those are not part of the same market because they are not available for licence by third party device manufacturers.\n\nNevertheless, the Commission investigated to what extent competition for end users (downstream), in particular between Apple and Android devices, could indirectly constrain Google's market power for the licensing of Android to device manufacturers (upstream). The Commission found that this competition does not sufficiently constrain Google upstream for a number of reasons, including:\n\nApp stores for the Android mobile operating system\n\nGoogle is dominant in the worldwide market (excluding China) for app stores for the Android mobile operating system. Google's app store, the Play Store, accounts for more than 90% of apps downloaded on Android devices. This market is also characterised by high barriers to entry. For similar reasons to those already listed above, Google's app store dominance is not constrained by Apple's App Store, which is only available on iOS devices.\n\nBreach of EU antitrust rules\n\nMarket dominance is, as such, not illegal under EU antitrust rules. However, dominant companies have a special responsibility not to abuse their powerful market position by restricting competition, either in the market where they are dominant or in separate markets.\n\nGoogle has engaged in three separate types of practices, which all had the aim of cementing Google's dominant position in general internet search.\n\n1) Illegal tying of Google's search and browser apps\n\nGoogle offers its mobile apps and services to device manufacturers as a bundle, which includes the Google Play Store, the Google Search app and the Google Chrome browser. Google's licensing conditions make it impossible for manufacturers to pre-install some apps but not others.\n\nAs part of the Commission investigation, device manufacturers confirmed that the Play Store is a \"must-have\" app, as users expect to find it pre-installed on their devices (not least because they cannot lawfully download it themselves).\n\nThe Commission decision has concluded that Google has engaged in two instances of illegal tying:\n\nPre-installation can create a status quo bias. Users who find search and browser apps pre-installed on their devices are likely to stick to these apps. For example, the Commission has found evidence that the Google Search app is consistently used more on Android devices, where it is pre-installed, than on Windows Mobile devices, where users must download it. This also shows that users do not download competing apps in numbers that can offset the significant commercial advantage derived through pre-installation. For example, in 2016:\n\nGoogle's practice has therefore reduced the incentives of manufacturers to pre-install competing search and browser apps, as well as the incentives of users to download such apps. This reduced the ability of rivals to compete effectively with Google.\n\nThe Commission also assessed in detail Google's arguments that the tying of the Google Search app and Chrome browser were necessary, in particular to allow Google to monetise its investment in Android, and concluded that these arguments were not well founded. Google achieves billions of dollars in annual revenues with the Google Play Store alone, it collects a lot of data that is valuable to Google's search and advertising business from Android devices, and it would still have benefitted from a significant stream of revenue from search advertising without the restrictions.\n\n2) Illegal payments conditional on exclusive pre-installation of Google Search\n\nGoogle granted significant financial incentives to some of the largest device manufacturers as well as mobile network operators on condition that they exclusively pre-installed Google Search across their entire portfolio of Android devices. This harmed competition by significantly reducing their incentives to pre-install competing search apps.\n\nThe Commission's investigation showed that a rival search engine would have been unable to compensate a device manufacturer or mobile network operator for the loss of the revenue share payments from Google and still make profits. That is because, even if the rival search engine was pre-installed on only some devices, they would have to compensate the device manufacturer or mobile network operator for a loss of revenue share from Google across all devices.\n\nIn line with the recent EU court ruling in Intel, the Commission has considered, amongst other factors, the conditions under which the incentives were granted, their amount, the share of the market covered by these agreements and their duration.\n\nOn this basis, the Commission found Google's conduct to be illegal between 2011 and 2014. In 2013 (after the Commission started to look into this issue), Google started to gradually lift the requirement. The illegal practice effectively ceased as of 2014.\n\nThe Commission also assessed in detail Google's arguments that the granting of financial incentives for exclusive pre-installation of Google Search across the entire portfolio of Android devices was necessary. In this regard, the Commission dismissed Google's claim that payments based on exclusivity were necessary to convince device manufacturers and mobile network operators to produce devices for the Android ecosystem.\n\n3) Illegal obstruction of development and distribution of competing Android operating systems\n\nGoogle has prevented device manufacturers from using any alternative version of Android that was not approved by Google (Android forks). In order to be able to pre-install on their devices Google's proprietary apps, including the Play Store and Google Search, manufacturers had to commit not to develop or sell even a single device running on an Android fork. The Commission found that this conduct was abusive as of 2011, which is the date Google became dominant in the market for app stores for the Android mobile operating system.\n\nThis practice reduced the opportunity for devices running on Android forks to be developed and sold. For example, the Commission has found evidence that Google's conduct prevented a number of large manufacturers from developing and selling devices based on Amazon's Android fork called \"Fire OS\".\n\nIn doing so, Google has also closed off an important channel for competitors to introduce apps and services, in particular general search services, which could be pre-installed on Android forks. Therefore, Google's conduct has had a direct impact on users, denying them access to further innovation and smart mobile devices based on alternative versions of the Android operating system. In other words, as a result of this practice, it was Google - and not users, app developers and the market - that effectively determined which operating systems could prosper.\n\nThe Commission also assessed in detail Google's arguments that these restrictions were necessary to prevent a \"fragmentation\" of the Android ecosystem, and concluded that these were not well founded. First, Google could have ensured that Android devices using Google proprietary apps and services were compliant with Google's technical requirements, without preventing the emergence of Android forks. Second, Google did not provide any credible evidence that Android forks would be affected by technical failures or fail to support apps.\n\nThe Commission decision concludes that these three types of abuse form part of an overall strategy by Google to cement its dominance in general internet search, at a time when the importance of mobile internet was growing significantly.\n\nFirst, Google's practices have denied rival search engines the possibility to compete on the merits. The tying practices ensured the pre-installation of Google's search engine and browser on practically all Google Android devices and the exclusivity payments strongly reduced the incentive to pre-install competing search engines. Google also obstructed the development of Android forks, which could have provided a platform for rival search engines to gain traffic. Google's strategy has also prevented rival search engines from collecting more data from smart mobile devices, including search and mobile location data, which helped Google to cement its dominance as a search engine.\n\nFurthermore, Google's practices also harmed competition and further innovation in the wider mobile space, beyond just internet search. That's because they prevented other mobile browsers from competing effectively with the pre-installed Google Chrome browser. Finally, Google obstructed the development of Android forks, which could have provided a platform also for other app developers to thrive.\n\nConsequences of the decision\n\nThe Commission's fine of \u20ac4 342 865 000 takes account of the duration and gravity of the infringement. In accordance with the Commission's 2006 Guidelines on fines (see press release and MEMO), the fine has been calculated on the basis of the value of Google's revenue from search advertising services on Android devices in the EEA.\n\nThe Commission decision requires Google to bring its illegal conduct to an end in an effective manner within 90 days of the decision.\n\nAt a minimum, Google has to stop and to not re-engage in any of the three types of practices. The decision also requires Google to refrain from any measure that has the same or an equivalent object or effect as these practices.\n\nThe decision does not prevent Google from putting in place a reasonable, fair and objective system to ensure the correct functioning of Android devices using Google proprietary apps and services, without however affecting device manufacturers' freedom to produce devices based on Android forks.\n\nIt is Google's sole responsibility to ensure compliance with the Commission decision. The Commission will monitor Google's compliance closely and Google is under an obligation to keep the Commission informed of how it will comply with its obligations.\n\nIf Google fails to ensure compliance with the Commission decision, itwould be liable for non-compliance payments of up to 5% of the average daily worldwide turnover of Alphabet, Google's parent company. The Commission would have to determine such non-compliance in a separate decision, with any payment backdated to when the non-compliance started.\n\nFinally, Google is also liable to face civil actions for damages that can be brought before the courts of the Member States by any person or business affected by its anti-competitive behaviour. The new EU Antitrust Damages Directive makes it easier for victims of anti-competitive practices to obtain damages.\n\nOther Google cases\n\nIn June 2017, the Commission fined Google \u20ac2.42 billion for abusing its dominance as a search engine by giving an illegal advantage to Google's own comparison shopping service. The Commission is currently actively monitoring Google's compliance with that decision.\n\nThe Commission also continues to investigate restrictions that Google has placed on the ability of certain third party websites to display search advertisements from Google's competitors (the AdSense case). In July 2016, the Commission came to the preliminary conclusion that Google has abused its dominant position in a case concerning AdSense.\n\nBackground\n\nToday's decision is addressed to Google LLC (previously Google Inc.) and Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company. The Commission opened proceedings concerning Google's conduct as regards the Android operating system and applications in April 2015 and sent a Statement of Objections to Google in April 2016.",

                "title": "Garmin\u00ae provides key updates for TXi flight displays, GTN navigators, GFC autopilots and the G5 electronic flight instrument",
                "body": "Garmin International, Inc., a unit of Garmin Ltd. (NASDAQ: GRMN), today announced it's adding significant capability, more configuration options and offering greater integration throughout the GTN\u0099 650/750 touchscreen navigators, the G500 TXi/G600 TXi and G500/G600 flight displays, as well as the GFC\u0099 600 & GFC 500 autopilots. Additionally, the G5 electronic flight instrument for certificated aircraft is being approved for use as a standby instrument when paired with the G500 TXi or G500 flight displays. The GFC 500 autopilot will also be approved for installation with the G500 TXi or G500 flight displays, while the addition of descent vertical navigation (VNAV) within the GTN will aid in descent planning. With Garmin, pilots receive a seamlessly integrated cockpit that offers a more harmonious transition among avionics, which reduces pilot workload and provides a superior in-flight experience.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180718005130/en/\n\n\"The Garmin avionics ecosystem continues to provide pilots with optimized upgrade opportunities and unsurpassed capabilities within the cockpit,\" said Carl Wolf, vice president of aviation marketing and sales. \"We are committed to providing pilots with scalable, value-oriented solutions when selecting their panel configurations. For customers with these products currently installed, these software updates offer greater operational potential and a broader feature set than any other avionics solution on the market.\"\n\nGTN 650/750 descent vertical navigation\n\nTo assist in descent planning and energy management, pilots can take advantage of VNAV profiles throughout the enroute and terminal phases of flight within the GTN 650/750 touchscreen navigators when they're paired with the G500 TXi/G600 TXi, G500/G600 or G5. Within the GTN, pilots can easily enter altitude constraints on the flight plan page to set-up a vertical descent profile. Pilots also experience a near-seamless transition from VNAV to an arrival and instrument approach. Once an arrival or approach is loaded and activated, the GTN automatically populates step-down altitudes or any applicable altitude restrictions. If ATC issues an unpublished altitude restriction, pilots can enter those altitudes manually into the active flight plan under the VNAV field.\n\nAs part of the VNAV profile, top of descent (TOD) and bottom of descent (BOD) values are also calculated and displayed on the moving map. As the aircraft arrives at TOD, the GTN displays a visual annunciation prompting the pilot to begin the descent. When paired with a display such as a G500 TXi/G600 TXi, G500/G600 or G5, a vertical deviation indication (VDI) also populates on the display to provide vertical guidance for the descent. Additionally, when the GTN 650/750 series is paired with the GFC 600 or GFC 500 autopilot, pilots can select the VNAV button on the mode controller to fly a fully-coupled VNAV profile.\n\nApproved as a standby: G5 electronic flight instrument\n\nThe ever-popular G5 electronic flight instrument will soon be approved as a standby flight instrument when paired with the G500 TXi or G500 flight displays. In doing so, any adjustments made to heading bugs, altitude select, airspeed bugs, as well as the barometric pressure setting are automatically synced from the G500 TXi or G500 displays to the G5. Flight director and autopilot mode annunciations from the GFC 500 can also be viewed across all displays, including G5. Over 600 aircraft will be approved for the installation of G5 as a standby flight instrument alongside the G500 TXi or G500 flight displays.\n\nGFC 500: Now approved for G500 TXi and G500-equipped aircraft\n\nAircraft owners can soon pair the economical GFC 500 autopilot with the G500 TXi or G500 flight displays, offering a fully-redundant, all-glass cockpit when paired with the G5. For example, in the unlikely event of a G500 TXi flight display failure, the G5 will remain coupled to the GFC 500 autopilot and continue to fly normal autopilot modes, including altitude select, heading, vertical speed and more. This compatibility significantly reduces pilot workload.\n\nCourse deviation indication (CDI) and VDI preview\n\nA popular feature in turbine class aircraft, a CDI preview option allows pilots to view course and vertical deviation information prior to an instrument approach. When the GTN series is paired with the G500 TXi/G600 TXi or G500/G600, pilots can view this feature within the HSI or lateral deviation indicator on the flight display. When GPS is the selected CDI source, information such as a course pointer, lateral deviation, station ID and the numeric inbound course automatically populate on the HSI in gray when an instrument approach is loaded. For ILS and GPS approaches with vertical guidance, a preview of the VDI also populates on the TXi series, G500/G600 or G5, allowing pilots to view glideslope or glidepath deviation prior to the descent.\n\nGarmin Pilot\u0099 and Engine Information System (EIS) analytics\n\nExclusive to Garmin, customers can now utilize Garmin Pilot on Apple mobile devices to view real-time engine information via Flight Stream 510 when the app is paired with an EIS-capable TXi flight display or the G1000 NXi integrated flight deck. Upon landing, the flight data log is wirelessly uploaded to the flyGarmin website and is stored securely within the app and on flyGarmin. Within the flyGarmin website, pilots can access detailed information related to any flight, play-back the flight and download data logs.\n\nNew TXi display orientations, configurations and capabilities\n\nThe GTN 650/750 touchscreen navigators also incorporate a variety of additional features, including:\n\nThese software updates are expected to be available in August from Garmin Authorized Dealers for hundreds of aircraft makes and models. These updates are available from Garmin at no charge. A dealer installation charge may apply. Garmin avionics are supported by Garmin's award-winning aviation support team, which provides 24/7 worldwide technical and warranty support. Garmin will be showcasing these new features and configuration options next week at the 2018 EAA AirVenture fly-in, in Oshkosh, Wis., July 23-29, 2018.

                "body": "Garmin International, Inc., a unit of Garmin Ltd. (NASDAQ: GRMN), today announced several new additions to the Garmin Pilot\u0099 feature set for Apple and Android mobile devices. Among the updates, wireless real-time display and play-back of engine data is available within Garmin Pilot via Flight Stream 510 when the app is paired with an EIS-capable TXi flight display or the G1000 NXi integrated flight deck. A new document viewer provides easy access to the Garmin aviation library, as well as access to popular cloud storage providers, and the addition of weather improvements further enhances the app. New for Android, weight and balance calculations and several more features aid in flight planning. These new capabilities offer greater utility within a single application and more integration within the Garmin ecosystem.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180718005149/en/\n\n\"With Garmin Pilot, customers receive an optimized Garmin experience, whether it's monitoring engine performance, accessing Garmin pilots guides within the document viewer, database loading or wirelessly transferring flight plan data - pilots have it all easily accessible at their fingertips,\" said Carl Wolf, vice president of aviation marketing and sales. \"Garmin Pilot is a comprehensive application with capabilities that no other app on the market can deliver. A simple and familiar user-interface that closely represents Garmin avionics, cutting-edge integration and a competitive feature set combine to offer pilots the best value in the industry.\"\n\nExclusive to Garmin, customers will be able to utilize Garmin Pilot on Apple mobile devices to view real-time engine information via Flight Stream 510 when the app is paired with an EIS-capable TXi flight display or the G1000 NXi integrated flight deck. Upon landing, the flight data log is wirelessly uploaded to the flyGarmin website and is stored securely within the app and on flyGarmin. Within the flyGarmin website, pilots can access detailed information related to any flight, play back the flight and download data logs. Pilot-configurable exceedances can also be set within the flyGarmin website. In the event an exceedance occurs, pilots can receive an email alert that details that particular exceedance. Utilizing Garmin Pilot alongside an EIS-capable TXi flight display or G1000 NXi, pilots are provided with a comprehensive, in-depth look at engine performance and trend data and can more easily troubleshoot and identify potential issues.\n\nBest-in-class document viewer\n\nThe new document viewer within Garmin Pilot helps pilots better organize and access a variety of informational products, including the latest Garmin library of manuals such as pilots guides and cockpit reference guides, aviation handbooks and more. The premium version of Garmin Pilot allows customers to access popular cloud storage sites like DropBox to create and add their own documents such as an aircraft flight manual (AFM) in PDF, JPG and PNG formats. Additionally, pilots can bookmark all electronic documents and highlight them for easy recall within the app.\n\nAdditional enhancements expected to be available for Apple mobile devices:\n\nGarmin Pilot for Android mobile devices\n\nGarmin Pilot on Android mobile devices incorporates weight and balance calculations into a flight plan or a saved trip, taking into account fuel burn and more. Pilots can take advantage of pre-loaded aircraft types or enter aircraft weight and balance figures manually, noting the arm, moment and station of each point from the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH). Center of gravity (CG) is easily referenced in the application relative to an active flight plan. In the event CG limits entered within the app are not loaded within the envelope, pilots receive a notification. Additionally, customized weight and balance profiles can be shared across multiple Garmin Pilot accounts.\n\nAdditional features expected to be available for Android mobile devices:\n\nThe newest release of Garmin Pilot for Apple and Android mobile devices is expected to be available next week during the 2018 EAA AirVenture fly-in, in Oshkosh, Wis., July 23-29, 2018. For new customers, Garmin Pilot is available from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store as a free download for the first 30 days. After the 30-day trial period, customers may purchase an annual subscription of Garmin Pilot starting at $74.99.

                "body": "Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \"Trains and the signalling equipment that guide them are essential for transport in Europe. The Commission will investigate whether the proposed acquisition of Alstom by Siemens would deprive European rail operators of a choice of suppliers and innovative products, and lead to higher prices, which could ultimately harm the millions of Europeans who use rail transportation every day for work or leisure.\"\n\nSiemens and Alstom are global leaders in rail transportation. Both companies have a wide product portfolio and compete in tenders for the manufacture and supply of:\n\nThe proposed transaction would combine the two largest suppliers of rolling stock and signalling solutions in the European Economic Area (EEA) not only in terms of size of the combined operations, but also in terms of geographic footprint of their activities.\n\nAt this stage, the Commission is concerned that the proposed transaction would reduce competition in the markets where the merged entity would be active. In particular, the Commission is concerned that the proposed transaction could lead to higher prices, less choice and less innovation due to reduced competitive pressure in rolling stock and signalling tenders. This would be to the detriment of train operators, infrastructure managers and ultimately European passengers who use trains and metros on a daily basis.\n\nMore specifically, the Commission's initial investigation found that:\n\nFurthermore, at this stage the Commission has found that the entry of new competitors into the EEA rolling stock or signalling solutions markets, including in particular of potential Chinese suppliers, appears unlikely to occur in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Commission will now carry out an in-depth investigation into the effects of the transaction to determine whether its initial competition concerns are confirmed.\n\nThe transaction was notified to the Commission on 8 June 2018. The Commission now has 90 working days, until 21 November 2018, to take a decision. The opening of an in-depth investigation does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation.\n\nSiemens, based in Germany, is active worldwide in several industrial areas with its mobility division offering a broad portfolio of rolling stock, rail automation and signalling solutions, rail electrification systems, road traffic technology, IT solutions, as well as other products and services concerning the transportation of people and goods by rail and road.\n\nAlstom, based in France, is active worldwide in the rail transport industry, offering a wide range of transport solutions (from high-speed trains to metros, trams and e-buses), personalised services (maintenance and modernisation) as well as products dedicated to passengers and infrastructure, signalling solutions, rail electrification systems and digital mobility.\n\nThe transaction was notified to the Commission on 8 June 2018.\n\nThe Commission has the duty to assess mergers and acquisitions involving companies with a turnover above certain thresholds (see Article 1 of the Merger Regulation) and to prevent concentrations that would significantly impede effective competition in the EEA or any substantial part of it.\n\nThe vast majority of notified mergers do not pose competition problems and are cleared after a routine review. From the moment a transaction is notified, the Commission generally has a total of 25 working days to decide whether to grant approval (Phase I) or to start an in-depth investigation (Phase II).\n\nIn addition to the current transaction, there are four ongoing Phase II merger investigations: the proposed acquisition of Solvay's nylon business by BASF, the proposed acquisition of Tele2 NL by T-Mobile NL, the proposed acquisition of Shazam by Apple and the proposed merger of Praxair and Linde.",

                "body": "Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \"Titanium dioxide pigment is an essential ingredient in many consumer products, including paper laminate used in furniture and interiors. Tronox and Cristal are two of the four major players in this market but we can approve their merger because the companies offered a suitable remedy that fully addresses our competition concerns. This decision will ensure that these products can continue to be offered at competitive prices and without reducing the number of suppliers available for consumers.\"\n\nTronox and Cristal are both active in the production of titanium dioxide pigment. They also own titanium feedstock mines, which provide the input material for pigment production, and sell zircon as a by-product of the mining. Titanium dioxide pigment, which is manufactured through either a chloride or a sulphate based production process, is used to whiten and opacify a wide range of consumer products, including paints, plastics and paper. Zircon is used in the production of tiles, ceramics and fire bricks.\n\nThe Commission carried out an in-depth review of the proposed acquisition and found that the takeover, as initially notified, would have significantly reduced competition on the European market for chloride-based titanium dioxide pigment for use in paper laminate. Tronox and Cristal are currently two of only four major suppliers of this product, the others being Chemours and Kronos. The acquisition would therefore have led to a reduction in choice and, potentially, to price increases.\n\nConversely, the Commission's investigation found no competition concerns regarding:\n\nTo address the Commission's competition concerns, Tronox offered to sell its global business in titanium dioxide pigment for paper laminate comprising the required technology and other intangibles to an experienced manufacturer with chloride-based production technology in the European Economic Area (EEA).\n\nThe acquisition of Cristal is subject to the Commission approving the buyer that Tronox will propose. In its assessment the Commission will consider the proposed buyer's suitability and incentive to compete in a way that would replicate the current competitive dynamic on the market where the Commission found competition concerns.\n\nThese commitments fully address the Commission's concerns as they ensure that the same number of suppliers will remain active on the market of chloride-based titanium dioxide pigment for paper laminate, and that customers continue to enjoy the same level of choice.\n\nThe Commission therefore considers that the proposed transaction, as modified by the commitments, would no longer raise competition concerns. The Commission's decision is conditional upon full compliance with the commitments.\n\nThe Commission has cooperated closely with other competition authorities, including the US Federal Trade Commission the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Chinese Competition Authority.\"\n\nTronox, registered in Australia and headquartered in the US, is active in mining and in the production of minerals and chemicals, including titanium dioxide. It owns mines in Australia and South Africa, and operates production sites in Europe, the US and Australia.\n\nCristal (The National Titanium Dioxide Company Ltd.) is headquartered in Saudi Arabia and is part of the Tasnee industrial company. Cristal is active in mining and in the production of titanium dioxide and other titanium chemicals. It owns mines in Australia and Brazil, and operates production sites in Europe, the US, China, Brazil and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Commission has the duty to assess mergers and acquisitions involving companies with a turnover above certain thresholds (see Article 1 of the Merger Regulation) or that have been referred to it (see Article 4(5) of the Merger Regulation) and to prevent concentrations that would significantly impede effective competition in the EEA or any substantial part of it.\n\nThe vast majority of notified mergers do not pose competition problems and are cleared after a routine review. From the moment a transaction is notified, the Commission generally has a total of 25 working days to decide whether to grant approval (Phase I) or to start an in-depth investigation (Phase II).\n\nIn addition to the current transaction, there are three other on-going phase II merger investigations: the proposed acquisition of Tele2 NL by T-Mobile NL, the proposed acquisition of Shazam by Apple and the proposed merger of Praxair and Linde.",

                "body": "Der amerikanische Telekommunikationskonzern AT&T Inc. (ISIN: US00206R1023, NYSE: T) wird eine Quartalsdividende in H\u00f6he von 0,50 US-Dollar an seine Aktion\u00e4re aussch\u00fctten. Die Auszahlung erfolgt am 1. August 2018 (Record date: 10. Juli 2018).\n\nAT&T zahlt auf das Jahr hochgerechnet somit 2,00 US-Dollar an seine Investoren aus. Das entspricht beim derzeitigen Aktienkurs von 32,11 US-Dollar (Stand: 29. Juni 2018) einer Dividendenrendite von 6,23 Prozent. AT&T z\u00e4hlt zu den sogenannten Dividendenaristokraten. Das sind Unternehmen, die seit mindestens 25 Jahren ihre Aussch\u00fcttung jedes Jahr anheben. Seit dem Jahr 1984 zahlt AT&T eine Dividende. Seitdem wurde die Dividende jedes Jahr angehoben.\n\nDie Historie von AT&T geht auf die Bell Telephone Company zur\u00fcck, die im Jahre 1877 von Alexander Graham Bell gegr\u00fcndet worden ist. Im Jahr 1984 erfolgte die Zerschlagung des US-Telefonmonopolmarktes und AT&T teilte sich in die ehemalige Muttergesellschaft im Ferngespr\u00e4chsmarkt sowie sieben regionale Anbieter (auch \"Baby Bells\" genannt) auf. Im Jahr 2005 \u00fcbernahm SBC AT&T und es entstand die heutige Firma. Im Jahr 2015 verlor AT&T seinen Platz im legend\u00e4ren Dow-Jones-Index an Apple.\n\nIm ersten Quartal des Fiskaljahrs 2018 erwirtschaftete AT&T einen Umsatz von 38 Mrd. US-Dollar (Vorjahr: 39,4 Mrd. US-Dollar. Der Nettogewinn betrug 4,7 Mrd. US-Dollar (Vorjahr: 3,5 Mrd. US-Dollar), wie am 25. April berichtet wurde.\n\nIm Oktober 2016 gab der Konzern bekannt, Time Warner f\u00fcr 85,4 Mrd. US-Dollar zu kaufen. Das US-Justizministerium hatte versucht die \u00dcbernahme mit einer Klage verhindern. Im Juni 2018 hat ein US-Gericht die \u00dcbernahme des Medienkonzerns durch AT&T trotz des Widerstands der US-Regierung ohne Auflagen genehmigt.\n\nDie Aktie des Konzerns ist an der Wall Street notiert und verzeichnet dort seit Jahresbeginn 2018 ein Kursminus von 17,41 Prozent. Die Marktkapitalisierung betr\u00e4gt aktuell 235,2 Mrd. US-Dollar (Stand: 29. Juni 2018).",

                "title": "Mergers: Commission opens in-depth investigation into proposed acquisition of Solvay's nylon business by BASF",
                "body": "Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \"Nylon is used in everyday products like clothes, sports shoes and carpets. But it's also an important industrial input, for example contributing to make lighter engines and cars. However, only a few manufacturers provide essential inputs to produce different nylon products, so we need to carefully assess whether the proposed acquisition would lead to higher prices or less choice for European businesses and, ultimately, consumers.\"\n\nThe proposed transaction involves Solvay and BASF, two companies active in the nylon industry, where both manufacture nylon compounds and nylon fibres.\n\nNylon compounds are used in a wide range of applications, particularly in the automotive and electronics industries, due to their light weight and good thermal resistance. As such, they are among the advanced materials used to develop lighter cars which produce less noxious emissions. Nylon fibres are used in particular for clothing and sportswear. The manufacture of nylon compounds and nylon fibres requires as a key input Adiponitrile (\"ADN\"), an oil derivative.\n\nSolvay is currently the only manufacturer in the European Economic Area with production assets at all levels of the nylon production chain, from ADN to nylon compounds and nylon fibres. Currently, Solvay sells an important part of its production of intermediates at various levels of the value chain to other companies active in making nylon compounds and fibres. BASF is also vertically integrated, but does not produce ADN. It currently only sells a small part of its production of intermediates because it uses almost all of its production internally, for the production of nylon compounds and fibers.\n\nThe proposed transaction would create an important player in the nylon compounds market with a market size almost double that of the closest competitor. The merged entity would also control substantial parts of the merchant markets and of the production capacities at all levels of the nylon production chain. Moreover, no other player would be similarly fully integrated in the production chain. Competitors will thus depend on the merged entity to continue to supply them with one or more essential inputs.\n\nIn addition, there is no indication that competition could be preserved by new entrants, since access to essential inputs (such as ADN) is limited and critical to be able to compete effectively.\n\nThe Commission's preliminary competition concerns\n\nAt this stage, the Commission is concerned that the proposed transaction would reduce competition in the markets where the merged entity would be active. In particular, the Commission is concerned that this transaction could lead to higher prices due to the increased market power of the merged entity in the nylon compounds market, as well as due to its enhanced position in the nylon production chain.\n\nIn particular, the Commission's initial market investigation raised competition concerns for the supply of the following essential inputs for the nylon production chain: ADN, Hexamethylene Diamine, Adipic Acid, Hexamethylenediamine adipate Salt, Polyamide 6.6 Base Polymer and Polyamide 6.6 Engineering Plastics.\n\nThe initial market investigation also showed that competitors of the merged entity fear that it would stop supplying them with these essential inputs because of its own increased needs downstream.\n\nThe Commission will now carry out an in-depth investigation into the effects of this transaction to determine whether its initial competition concerns are confirmed.\n\nThe transaction was notified to the Commission on 22 May 2018. The Commission now has 90 working days, until 31 October 2018, to take a decision. The opening of an in-depth investigation does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation.\n\nBASF, headquartered in Germany, is a large diversified chemical company active in a range of sectors including chemicals, performance products, functional materials and solutions, agricultural solutions and oil & gas. It is active in the polyamide value chain, in particular in the production of Hexamethylene Diamine, Adipic Acid, adipate Salt, Base Polymers and Engineering Plastics.\n\nSolvay, headquartered in Belgium, is activein the polyamide value chain, in particular in the production of ADN, Hexamethylene Diamine, Adipic Acid, adipate Salt, Base Polymers and Engineering Plastics.\n\nThe Commission has the duty to assess mergers and acquisitions involving companies with a turnover above certain thresholds (see Article 1 of the Merger Regulation) and to prevent concentrations that would significantly impede effective competition in the European Economic Area or any substantial part of it.\n\nThe vast majority of notified mergers do not involve competition problems and are cleared after a routine review. From the moment a transaction is notified, the Commission generally has 25 working days to decide whether to grant approval (Phase I) or to start an in-depth investigation (Phase II).\n\nIn addition to the current transaction, there are four ongoing Phase II merger investigations: the proposed acquisition of Tele2 NL by T-Mobile NL, the proposed acquisition of Cristal by Tronox, the proposed acquisition of Shazam by Apple and the proposed merger of Praxair and Linde.",

                "title": "State aid: Commission finds Luxembourg gave illegal tax benefits to Engie; has to recover around \u20ac120 million",
                "body": "Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said \"Luxembourg gave illegal tax benefits to Engie. Its tax rulings have endorsed two complex financing structures put in place by Engie that treat the same transaction in an inconsistent way, both as debt and as equity. This artificially reduced the company's tax burden. As a result, Engie paid an effective corporate tax rate of 0.3% on certain profits in Luxembourg for about a decade. This selective tax treatment is illegal.\"\n\nFollowing an in-depth investigation launched in September 2016, the Commission concluded that two sets of tax rulings issued by Luxembourg have artificially lowered Engie's tax burden in Luxembourg for about a decade, without any valid justification.\n\nIn 2008 and 2010, respectively, Engie implemented two complex intra-group financing structures for two Engie group companies in Luxembourg, Engie LNG Supply and Engie Treasury Management. These involved a triangular transaction between Engie LNG Supply and Engie Treasury Management, respectively, and two other Engie group companies in Luxembourg.\n\nThe Commission concluded that Luxembourg's tax treatment of these financing structures did not reflect economic reality. Tax rulings issued by Luxembourg endorsed an inconsistent treatment of the same transaction both as debt and as equity. On this basis, the Commission concluded that the tax rulings granted a selective economic advantage to Engie by allowing the group to pay less tax than other companies subject to the same national tax rules. In fact, the rulings enabled Engie to avoid paying any tax on 99% of the profits generated by Engie LNG Supply and Engie Treasury Management in Luxembourg.\n\nThe Commission decision concerns Luxembourg's tax treatment of the profits made by two companies in the Engie group, namely Engie LNG Supply (whichbuys, sells and trades liquefied natural gas and related products in Luxembourg) and Engie Treasury Management (which manages internal financing within the Engie group).\n\nBoth are Luxembourg-incorporated companies that are fully-owned by the Engie group and ultimately controlled by Engie S.A. in France.\n\nIn 2008, Engie put in place a complex hybrid convertible loan structure between three Engie group companies. This triangular structure financed Engie LNG Supply's acquisition of Engie's existing gas trading business in Luxembourg. In particular:\n\nThis structure enabled the treatment of the same financing both as debt (from the perspective of Engie LNG Supply) and as an investment in return for shares (from the perspective of Engie LNG Holding). As a result, LNG Supply only paid taxes on about 1% of its profits. The remaining 99% were not taxed neither at the level of LNG Supply nor at the level of Engie LNG Holding, which received these profits in the form of shares. Income from shares is exempted from taxation under standard Luxembourg tax law (as it is in many other countries).\n\nIn other words, for about a decade, Engie's effective tax rate on these profits in Luxembourg was less than 0.3%. This structure was endorsed by Luxembourg under a tax ruling granted in 2008 (which was amended a number of times).\n\nIn 2010, Engie put in place the same structure between Engie Treasury Management and Compagnie Europ\u00e9enne de Financement (C.E.F). This was also endorsed by Luxembourg under a separate tax ruling.\n\nThe role of EU State aid control is to ensure that Member States do not give selected companies a better tax treatment than others, via tax rulings or otherwise.\n\nThe Commission's State aid investigation concluded that the Luxembourg tax rulings gave Engie a significant competitive advantage in Luxembourg. It does not call into question the general tax regime of Luxembourg.\n\nIn particular, the Commission found that the tax rulings endorsed an inconsistent tax treatment of the same structure leading to non-taxation at all levels. Engie LNG Supply and Engie Treasury Management each significantly reduce their taxable profits in Luxembourg by deducting expenses similar to interest payments for a loan. At the same time, Engie LNG Holding and C.E.F. avoid paying any tax because Luxembourg tax rules exempt income from equity investments from taxation.\n\nThis is a more favourable treatment than under the standard Luxembourg tax rules, which exempt from taxation income received by a shareholder from its subsidiary, provided that income is in general taxed at the level of the subsidiary.\n\nOn this basis, the Commission concluded that the tax rulings issued by Luxembourg gave a selective advantage to the Engie group which could not be justified. Therefore, the Commission decision found that Luxembourg's tax treatment of Engie endorsed by the tax rulings is illegal under EU State aid rules.\n\nAs a matter of principle, EU State aid rules require that illegal State aid is recovered in order to remove the distortion of competition created by the aid. There are no fines under EU State aid rules and recovery does not penalise the company in question. It simply restores equal treatment with other companies.\n\nIn the case of LNG Supply, all income that has been transferred to Engie LNG Holding should have been taxed either as profits of Engie LNG Supply or profits of Engie LNG Holding at the standard Luxembourg corporate tax rate of around 29%. This means that Luxembourg must now recover about 120 million euros in unpaid tax from Engie, plus interest. It is for the Luxembourg tax authorities to determine the exact amount, based on the method set out in our decision.\n\nIn the case of the second company, Engie Treasury Management, its profits have not been channelled to C.E.F. yet. They will have to be taxed in line with standard Luxembourg tax rules, as soon as the loan is converted and they are paid to the holding company. This will be closely monitored by the Luxembourg authorities and the Commission.\n\nEngie (former GDF Suez) is a French electric utility company. Engie Treasury Management S.\u00e0.r.l., a treasury company, and Engie LNG Supply, S.A, a liquefied natural gas trading company, are both part of the Engie group. In November 2017, Total has signed an agreement with Engie to acquire its LNG business, including Engie LNG Supply.\n\nBackground on Commission tax State aid investigations\n\nTax rulings as such are not a problem under EU State aid rules, if they simply confirm that tax arrangements between companies within the same group comply with the relevant tax legislation. However, tax rulings that confer a selective tax advantage to specific companies can distort competition within the EU's Single Market, in breach of EU State aid rules.\n\nSince June 2013, the Commission has been investigating individual tax rulings of Member States under EU State aid rules. It extended this information inquiry to all Member States in December 2014. In October 2015, the Commission concluded that Luxembourg and the Netherlands had granted selective tax advantages to Fiat and Starbucks, respectively. In January 2016, the Commission concluded that selective tax advantages granted by Belgium to at least 35 multinationals, mainly from the EU, under its \"excess profit\" tax scheme are illegal under EU State aid rules. In August 2016, the Commission concluded that Ireland granted undue tax benefits of up to \u20ac13 billion to Apple. In October 2017, the Commission concluded that Luxembourg granted undue tax benefits of up to \u20ac250 million to Amazon.\n\nThe Commission also has two ongoing in-depth investigations concerning tax rulings issued by Luxembourg in favour of Mc Donald's and Inter IKEA, and one investigation concerning a tax scheme for multinationals in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe non-confidential versions of the decision will be made available under the case number SA.44888 in the State aid register on the Commission's competition website once any confidentiality issues have been resolved. New publications of State aid decisions on the internet and in the Official Journal are listed in the State Aid Weekly e-News.",

Die Entscheidungskriterien\n\nf\u00fcr die Auswahl des Verkehrsmittels haben sich in den letzten f\u00fcnf\n\nJahren weiter ver\u00e4ndert. Sicherheit, Flexibilit\u00e4t und Verf\u00fcgbarkeit\n\nsind urbanen Mobilit\u00e4tskunden am wichtigsten. Diese ver\u00e4nderten\n\nKundenpr\u00e4ferenzen erm\u00f6glichen zunehmend neue L\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr die urbane\n\nMobilit\u00e4t. Damit entsteht eine neue Mobilit\u00e4tswertsch\u00f6pfungskette mit\n\nhoher Wettbewerbsdynamik zwischen Herstellern, Zulieferern,\n\nTechnologieunternehmen, Autovermietungen, Leasing-Unternehmen und\n\nanderen Playern. Zu diesem Schluss kommt die Studie \"Neue urbane\n\nMobilit\u00e4t: Der Wandel erfolgt jetzt\" der internationalen\n\nManagementberatung Bain & Company. F\u00fcr die Studie wurden rund 1.700\n\nEinwohner in den Ballungsr\u00e4umen Berlin, M\u00fcnchen, Rhein-Ruhr und Wien\n\nbefragt.\n\nDie ma\u00dfgeblichen Treiber dieser Entwicklung sind Politik,\n\ntechnologischer Fortschritt und die pers\u00f6nliche Einstellung der\n\nStadtbev\u00f6lkerung zur Mobilit\u00e4t. W\u00e4hrend Gro\u00dfst\u00e4dte wegen \u00fcberlasteter\n\nVerkehrswege und negativer Umwelteinfl\u00fcsse Fahrverbote erw\u00e4gen,\n\nsteigen Autofahrer zunehmend auf Carsharing oder individualisierte\n\nMitfahrgelegenheiten (Ride-Hailing) um. \"Bisher werden alternative\n\nMobilit\u00e4tsangebote vor allem als Erg\u00e4nzung zum eigenen Auto genutzt\",\n\nstellt Bain-Partner und Co-Autor der Studie Dr. Klaus Stricker fest.\n\n\"Doch das Umdenken ist in den K\u00f6pfen vieler St\u00e4dter bereits in vollem\n\nGang.\"\n\nAutobesitz wird in Ballungsgebieten unattraktiver\n\nSicherheit, Flexibilit\u00e4t und Verf\u00fcgbarkeit sind f\u00fcr die\n\nStudienteilnehmer die wichtigsten Entscheidungskriterien bei der Wahl\n\ndes Verkehrsmittels (Abb. 1). Seit 2013 haben insbesondere\n\npers\u00f6nliche Sicherheit, Privatsph\u00e4re und Kommunikationsm\u00f6glichkeiten\n\nw\u00e4hrend der Fahrt an Bedeutung gewonnen. Verloren haben dagegen\n\nFahrspa\u00df und Flexibilit\u00e4t. Die Mobilit\u00e4tskosten liegen weiterhin im\n\nMittelfeld der Entscheidungskriterien, ihr Stellenwert hat in den\n\nletzten f\u00fcnf Jahren sogar leicht abgenommen.\n\nDiese Ergebnisse gehen einher mit einem weiteren Imageverlust des\n\nAutos. Nur noch 29 Prozent der Befragten betrachten das Auto als\n\nStatussymbol. Das sind 7 Prozentpunkte weniger als 2013. In Wien\n\nliegt dieser Wert mit 25 Prozent am niedrigsten. Abh\u00e4ngig vom\n\njeweiligen Zukunftsszenario sind 17 bis 34 Prozent der Autobesitzer\n\nin den vier untersuchten Ballungsr\u00e4umen bereit, bei passenden\n\nMobilit\u00e4tsalternativen auf ein eigenes Fahrzeug zu verzichten (Abb.\n\n2).\n\nGesch\u00e4ftsmodell und Mobilit\u00e4tsangebot weiterentwickeln\n\nNoch ist offen, welche Zukunftskonzepte sich durchsetzen werden.\n\n\"Allerdings laufen die Autohersteller Gefahr, dass sich andere Player\n\nzwischen sie und ihre heutigen Kunden dr\u00e4ngen\", erkl\u00e4rt Bain-Partner\n\nund Co-Autor der Studie Ralf Kalmbach. \"Schnittstelle und Interaktion\n\nmit den Kunden drohen verloren zu gehen, was sich negativ auf die\n\nProfitabilit\u00e4t auswirken kann.\" Bei neuen Mobilit\u00e4tsl\u00f6sungen stehen\n\ndie Automobilhersteller zunehmend im Wettbewerb mit\n\nTechnologieunternehmen wie Waymo, Uber, Didi oder Apple.\n\nViele Autohersteller etablieren bereits neue Gesch\u00e4ftsfelder und\n\nGesch\u00e4ftsmodelle. Kaum einer von ihnen wird jedoch die gesamte neue\n\nMobilit\u00e4tswertsch\u00f6pfungskette allein abdecken k\u00f6nnen. F\u00fcr die\n\nUnternehmen gilt es zu entscheiden, in welchen Bereichen sie in\n\nZukunft eigenst\u00e4ndig agieren und in welchen sie Partnerschaften\n\neingehen wollen. So erfordert beispielsweise die Entwicklung des\n\nautonomen Fahrens Milliardeninvestitionen. F\u00fcr Unternehmen, die mit\n\neigenen Forschungs- und Entwicklungsaktivit\u00e4ten nicht zu den\n\nVorreitern aufschlie\u00dfen k\u00f6nnen, sind Partnerschaften oder\n\nzugelieferte Technologien von Spezialisten wie Waymo sinnvoller. Auf\n\ndiese Weise ist es ihnen m\u00f6glich, sich auf andere Elemente der\n\nWertsch\u00f6pfungskette zu konzentrieren, in denen sie eine echte\n\nDifferenzierung und F\u00fchrungsposition erreichen k\u00f6nnen.\n\n\"Hersteller, die versuchen, ihre dominante F\u00fchrungsrolle im\n\nbisherigen Automobilgesch\u00e4ft eins zu eins auf die neue Mobilit\u00e4tswelt\n\nzu \u00fcbertragen, werden scheitern\", betont Bain-Partner Stricker. \"Wer\n\naber den Paradigmenwechsel schafft hin zum besten Anbieter in\n\neinzelnen Teilen der neuen Mobilit\u00e4tswertsch\u00f6pfungskette, wird sich\n\nauch in dieser Welt als f\u00fchrender Spieler etablieren k\u00f6nnen. Dazu\n\ngeh\u00f6rt auch, die f\u00fcr sich besten Partner zu gewinnen sowie\n\nintelligente Kooperationsmodelle aufzusetzen.\"\n\n\u00dcber die Studie\n\nBain & Company hat in der vorliegenden Studie zum zweiten Mal nach\n\n2013 die Einstellung von Erwachsenen in Deutschland und \u00d6sterreich zu\n\nneuen Mobilit\u00e4tskonzepten untersucht.

(NYSE: APLE) (the \"Company\" or \"Apple Hospitality\") today announced voting results from the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on May 17, 2018 (the \"Annual Meeting\"). At the Annual Meeting, with over 93% of votes cast voting in favor of each director nominee and proposal, the Company's shareholders approved:\n\nUpon election to the Board, Ms. McGarvie was appointed by the Board to serve on the Audit Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Mr. Matson will continue to serve as Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and on the Executive Committee, and Mr. Redd will continue to serve as Chairman of the Audit Committee and on the Compensation Committee.\n\nAs a result of the approval of the amendment to the Company's Charter to declassify the Board, each director elected at the Annual Meeting will serve a one-year term, as will each director elected at future shareholder meetings.\n\nIn addition, the Company today announced that its Board declared a regular monthly cash distribution of $0.10 per common share for the month of June 2018. The distribution is payable on June 18, 2018, to shareholders of record as of June 4, 2018.\n\nBased on the Company's common stock closing price of $18.39 on May 18, 2018, the annualized distribution of $1.20 per common share represents an annual yield of approximately 6.5 percent.\n\nAbout Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc.\n\nApple Hospitality REIT, Inc.

                "title": "HP sticks with successful strategy in new lineup of premium PCs",
                "body": "Nearly a dozen new models offer varied features at higher prices\n\nDespite slow growth in the personal-computer industry and high component costs, HP Inc. has found ways to flourish.\n\nThe computer manufacturer has thrived amid tough industry conditions thanks to a focus on premium PCs, which has allowed the company to command higher prices for its devices at a time when rivals are betting on the low-end market. HP HPQ, -0.18% continued that push on Monday, when it announced a number of new premium models across its consumer and commercial segments.\n\nSome, like upgraded versions of the EliteBook x360 1030 notebook and the Elite x2 1013 business detachable, cost incrementally more than their predecessors. These two models, which are on the commercial side, feature enhancements meant to appeal to enterprise customers whose employees do work outside the office.\n\nThe x360, for example, has built-in 4G LTE and anti-glare etching, and the X2 1013 has a privacy screen built in, which HP claimed in a media briefing last week was a first for the detachable category. While the x2 1013 doesn't look as cool as an iPad Pro, its detachable keyboard has considerable \"travel,\" meaning you can feel yourself push the keys down. It's a serious device that has appeal for those doing work on the go.\n\nMike Nash, HP's head of portfolio strategy, told MarketWatch that before HP began emphasizing premium models on the corporate side, companies didn't see much distinction between HP's two categories of computers and would end up buying consumer models for their employees. That was bad for HP's business. According to Nash, it also meant that employees ended up bringing their home computers to work because they didn't like what their company provided, which posed a security risk.\n\nHe believes that HP has made progress over the past three years with its introduction of enterprise devices that consumers feel are \"as good as\" their home computers. \"The feedback we hear from the millennial subsegment is that they're going to pick the company they work for based on a number of different things,\" Nash said, and one of them is \"what tech do I get?\"\n\nAcross its consumer and commercial divisions, HP unveiled 11 new products or models Monday. The company's sprawling portfolio, which extends beyond the devices announced this week, stands in contrast to that of Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.38% which essentially has three laptop models and three desktop ones. Nash argued that HP has more demand curves to satisfy than Apple.\n\n\"When you sell things to enterprise customers, they don't want things to change every year, and they want things design-wise to be much more consistent,\" Nash said. Consumers, meanwhile, might not want to pay extra for devices that are compatible with docking stations from years ago, durable enough to get bounced around in an overhead compartment, or impervious to onlookers via a privacy screen.\n\nOf course, the vast array of products for both consumers and enterprises means HP has more work to do in terms of making sure that people end up choosing the right one.\n\nOn the consumer side, the company announced a new \"super premium\" Envy 13 laptop with \"drop chin\" technology that essentially angles the keyboard once the computer is opened, giving the fan more air at the bottom. HP also rolled out a new 15-inch Envy X360 laptop with a keypad on the side, which Nash said was popular on the previous model.\n\nHP's focus on premium has proven a winning strategy lately, with shares up 18% over the past 12 months, while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.17% has gained 14%.",

                "body": "Just when it feels like the market might finally topple and give desperate bears their long-awaited told-ya-so moment, a stubborn streak like the one the Dow DJIA, +0.37% is currently riding proves again who has the upper hand: The bulls.\n\nYes, despite all the hand-wringing over tightening, lofty valuations, nasty politics, [insert any number of reasons to sell], this market still belongs to the bulls. The blue chips' stretch of seven positive sessions is the longest since November of last year, and much of the backbone of this little rally can be attributed to some stellar corporate earnings.\n\nWhether it can continue is another question, but there's a strong case to be made this market has a backstop in the explosion of buybacks lately.\n\nIt's still pretty early, but, according to a recent Goldman Sachs GS, -0.21% report, S&P SPX, +0.17% companies are on track to announce a record $650 billion in buybacks this year. Apple AAPL, -0.38% just to name one, is already out there with a massive $100 billion program.\n\nHere's a graphic from a Barron's piece on the subject:\n\n\"With this kind of corporate buying pressure in the market, it's very hard for shares to crash,\" writes Wolf Richter of the Wolf Street blog in our call of the day. \"Companies will pile into the market at every dip and buy as high as possible. It's unlikely the overall market can crash this year no matter what happens.\"\n\nHistorically, companies that buy back their own shares outperform the broader market. The Wall Street Journal reported the 20 biggest buyback spenders in the first quarter are up over 5%, on average, since the start of the year to easily beat the S&P.\n\nRichter points out that there's an added tailwind to the buybacks, considering companies are bringing back cash piles from abroad that's the Trump administration's new tax regime. While the idea was for companies to bring back that money and invest it in growing their U.S. operations, it's not exactly playing out that way.\n\n\"Everyone knew this was a pretext for a corporate tax cut that would free companies to do what they'd done during the last 'repatriation holiday' in 2004: Buy back their own shares, increase dividends, and jack up executive compensation packages,\" Richter said, adding that the overseas cash is a one-time treasure trove that has limits to its benefits.\n\n\"Once it's used up, it's gone. Then what?\" he asked.\n\nFor now, Richter believes a crash will be avoided -- the good news -- but the market will instead \"zig-zag\" lower until the excesses have been wrung out, and that could take years -- the bad news.\n\nFor now, the Dow's streak is poised to continue...\n\nThe market\n\nFutures on the Dow YMM8, +0.28% , S&P ESM8, +0.17% and Nasdaq NQM8, +0.24% are all up nicely premarket. Gold GCM8, -0.08% is holding mostly steady while crude is leaning lower. Europe SXXP, -0.31% is slipping as traders keep an eye news surrounding the new Italian government. Asia markets ADOW, +0.54% closed Monday's session mostly higher. Malaysian stocks FBMKLCI, +0.21% traded volatile in the first session after a shocking election win for the opposition party.\n\nSee the latest in Market Snapshot\n\nThe buzz\n\nWe're in the thick of commencement season, and some big names -- including Apple's Tim Cook at Duke and Oprah Winfrey at USC -- have already dropped knowledge on college graduates across the country. There are plenty more notables on tap in the coming weeks, as well, such as Canadian PM Justin Trudeau at NYU and Facebook's FB, +0.79% Sheryl Sandberg at MIT, for instance.\n\nAnother senior Tesla TSLA, -1.30% executive has hit the road. This time, it's Matthew Schwall, who was the company's main technical contact with U.S. safety regulators. He reportedly left Elon Musk and co. for rival Waymo LLC.\n\nXerox XRX, +2.86% is taking a hit after backing out of its merger deal with Fujifilm Holdings FUJIY, +1.04% as the company said it reached a new settlement with two of its biggest shareholders. Xerox said it would replace its chief executive and overhaul its board.\n\nThe chart\n\nTech industry analyst Horace Dediu tweeted out this chart of the fastest-growing tech platforms ever, including everything from iCould and Android to Netscape and China's bike-sharing program. Interestingly, it looks like that last one is eclipsing the first one in terms of pace of growth. The chart, broken down by quarter, shows how many users in millions a product had in the years after its launch.\n\nThe quote\n\n\"The greatest threat to American democracy isn't communism, jihadism, or any other external force or foreign power. It's our own willingness to tolerate dishonesty in service of party, and in pursuit of power\" -- Michael Bloomberg talking to Rice University students over the weekend about what he calls the \"epidemic of dishonesty.\"\n\nThe stat\n\n21% -- That's how much marijuana jobs are expected to grow per year through 2022, according to the \"2018 Marijuana Business Factbook.\" As it stands right now, about 125,000 to 160,000 people are employed by the cannabis industry, with that number expected to swell to 340,000 weed workers by 2022. To put that in perspective, health care is only expected to see jobs growth of about 2% per year over that period.\n\nThe economy\n\nA quiet day is on tap in terms of economic data, with nothing on the slate of note. Retail sales hits on Tuesday, while housing starts and industrial production will be posted on Wednesday, highlighting a relatively sparse calendar all week. On Thursday, the New York Fed releases its first-quarter household debt and credit report.\n\nRead: Inflation pause lends helping hand to borrowers.\n\nRandom reads\n\nTop economic minds come together to deliver this list of the best books, including \"Moneyball,\" on the topic ever written.\n\nThis is how a newspaper dies.\n\n\"Melania\" made some big strides among the most popular baby names in 2017. \"Donald,\" well, not so much.\n\nReally, how hard could it be to repopulate the planet?\n\nBill Gross's wife took a real Picasso off the couples wall and replaced it with a forgery during contentious divorce.\n\nA great stretch of holes by Tiger Woods over the weekend is giving his fans some hope that another major could happen.\n\nNeed to Know starts early and is updated until the opening bell, but sign up here to get it delivered once to your email box.

                "body": "Apple Inc.'s stock AAPL, -0.38% slipped 0.4% in morning trade Friday, putting it in danger of suffering its first loss in 10 sessions. The nine-session win streak through Thursday, which was the longest such streak since the nine-day stretch ending July 19, 2017, and Thursday's fifth-straight record close, were fueled by better-than-expected earnings and an endorsement from famed billionaire value investor Warren Buffett. The stock closed at a record $190.04 on Thursday. For those wondering why, with the stock trading at $188.74, some quoting services say its trading down just 57 cents from $189.31, it's because the stock went ex-dividend. That means the quoting services adjusted the close to reflect the payout of a 73-cent quarterly dividend. The stock has rallied 11.6% year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.27% has gained 0.4%.",

                "title": "Goldman Sachs and Apple explore a joint credit card. Should you get it? ",
                "body": "Apple and Goldman Sachs want a piece of your wallet.\n\nThe technology company AAPL, -0.07% and bank GS, +0.22% are teaming up to create a joint credit card, according to The Wall Street Journal. The companies are still deciding what the terms and benefits of the cards will be, the Journal reported.\n\nBoth companies declined to comment on that report.\n\n\"These are two iconic brands who have lived in very different worlds,\" said Matt Schulz, a senior analyst for the credit-card website CreditCards.com. The companies are looking to tap into each other's customer bases. A card that gives rewards to consumers buying Apple products could potentially encourage them to buy more, which could be a good thing (for deals) and a bad thing (if people overspend).\n\nApple already offers a credit card with the company Barclaycard BCS, +0.30% , that consumers can use to get \"special financing\" on Apple products, such as no interest paid within a promotional period. This new card could work similarly, giving consumers more ways to pay for Apple products, said Brian Karimzad, vice president of research at CompareCards.com.\n\nBut would this card be a good choice for consumers?\n\nShould you get the card?\n\nKarimzad offered a word of caution. The \"special financing\" that Apple's current credit card with Barclaycard offers can be expensive for consumers, and a new card could come with the same risks.\n\nIf consumers do not pay off their purchase completely by the end of the promotional period, or if they make a late payment, they will have to pay interest not only starting when the promotional period ends, but from the time they made the purchase. That model is called \"deferred interest,\" and consumers often misunderstand it.\n\nAnd the interest rates are steep: Either 15.49%, 21.49% or 28.49%, depending on the consumer's credit score.\n\nSpecial financing can be helpful to consumers who do pay off their full purchase by the end of the promotional period, Karimzad said. If, however, Goldman and Apple did not use the deferred interest model, Karimzad said, \"that would be a real win for consumers.\"\n\nOne obvious potential benefit for Apple aficionados: Consumers using the card could receive extra rewards when spending on an iPhone. What's more, Apple customers tend to be loyal to the brand, and that may help the card to become desirable, he said. Those who aren't interested in Apple products -- Android loyalists, for example -- likely wouldn't benefit as much.\n\nAnother possibility: Apple could offer additional rewards for consumers who make purchases when they link the card to Apple Pay, encouraging them to use it, Schulz said. Mobile payments have been slow to take off in the U.S., although they are growing.\n\nHow Apple helps Goldman Sachs\n\nGoldman Sachs has recently amped up its offerings for consumers, including personal loans and checking accounts with no minimum deposit required, from its brand Marcus. Adding a credit card to its portfolio could help Goldman make further headway, Karimzad said. (Karimzad also previously worked at Goldman Sachs.)\n\n\"Goldman sees a big opportunity in lending directly to consumers,\" he said. Tying the Goldman brand to the Apple brand could help with that, particularly if the new credit card offers special benefits to people buying Apple products, Schulz said. And Goldman could make money both on interest payments and merchant swipe fees, Karimzad added.\n\nHow Goldman Sachs helps Apple\n\nGoldman may split the profits from its merchant fees with Apple, Karimzad said. Apple is looking for other revenue beyond its own suite of products, and will likely negotiate a deal to get a cut of purchases made on the card, said Michelle Evans, the global head of digital consumer research at the research firm Euromonitor International.\n\nGoldman and Apple aren't the only major brands jumping into the credit-card space recently. Uber and Amazon AMZN, -0.17% have both recently debuted credit cards.",

                "body": "The stock market's main gauges will rack up weekly gains of 2% or more, if they can just make it through today's session unscathed.\n\nThey've got their swagger back, feeling good thanks to a tech rally. Facebook is fully recovered from that Cambridge Analytica brouhaha, and Apple's up 15% this month.\n\nBut should stocks slow their roll?\n\nHedge-fund manager Dan Loeb doesn't sound all that bullish, and he delivers our call of the day.\n\n\"We aren't in a time right now where you're going to be rewarded for taking a lot of long-market-exposure risk,\" the Third Point founder and CEO said yesterday during an earnings conference call.\n\nThe billionaire activist investor said he wouldn't necessarily characterize his shop's view as bearish, but he is highlighting a sea change.\n\n\"An important shift in markets happened in the first quarter. Over the past two years, markets were boosted by positive surprises in growth and benign inflation, but during the first quarter, uncertainty returned in each of these areas,\" he said, according to FactSet's transcript and recording for the conference call.\n\n\"Investors have become increasingly concerned about multiples -- particularly since, after many years of low rates, there's finally an alternative to equities in the form of relatively risk-less two-year money.\"\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD02Y, +0.19% this week has climbed to levels last seen more than nine years ago. It was recently at 2.535%. \"Concerned about multiples\" is a reference to price-to-earnings ratios or other valuation measures.\n\nAnd so Third Point is ramping up its bets against individual stocks, according to Loeb.\n\n\"This is a time where I think we can make money on the longs and on the shorts,\" he said.\n\n\"We're just seeing more opportunities to find companies that we think are going to go down -- or at least materially underperform the rest of the portfolio.\"\n\nAsked on the call about what looks great in particular for shorting, he demurred: \"We can't give all our secrets.\"\n\nBut his skittishness is clear, as forecasters say a U.S. recession could hit in 2020.\n\n\"We're watching closely to see if a recession, which we don't think is close, might be getting closer,\" said the boss at Third Point, which reportedly may launch a \"blank-check\" company as stock-market returns flatten.\n\nRead more: Dan Loeb's Third Point calls for Nestle changes\n\nAnd see: Loeb overestimates Trump's impact, still makes a killing\n\nKey market gauges\n\nFutures for the Dow YMM8, +0.23% , S&P 500 ESM8, +0.23% and Nasdaq-100 NQM8, +0.14% are edging higher. As of yesterday's close, the Dow DJIA, +0.80% is up 2% for the week and +0.1% for the year, while the S&P SPX, +0.94% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.89% are on track for weekly gains of 2.2% and 2.7%, respectively.\n\nEurope SXXP, +0.02% is mixed, after Asia largely closed higher.

                "body": "The most successful starters of new businesses are in their 40s, not their 20s\n\nThe romanticized image of entrepreneurs is a picture of youth: a 20-something individual with disruptive ideas, boundless energy and a still-sharp mind. Silicon Valley has bet on this image for years.\n\nBut is this right?\n\nFar from it, according to our recent research with Javier Miranda of the U.S. Census Bureau and Pierre Azoulay of MIT.\n\nOur team analyzed the age of all business founders in the U.S. in recent years. We found that the average age of the most successful entrepreneurs is 45 -- and that founders in their 20s are the least likely to build a top firm.\n\nThe myth of the young entrepreneur\n\nThe idea that the most successful new business ventures come from the young, even the very young, is widespread.\n\nYounger people are often thought to be less beholden to current thinking and thus more naturally innovative and disruptive. Many observers (perhaps enviously) believe the young have more time and energy, with fewer family responsibilities like nightly dinner with the kids or financial demands like mortgages. Besides, as Facebook FB, +1.57% founder Mark Zuckerberg said, \"Young people are just smarter.\"\n\nYoung founders also make for a dramatic story. The college dropout or young corporate drone shakes off conventional expectations to launch a new business with a ragtag team of fellow 20-somethings. After countless late nights, they emerge with the new killer app or consumer product that takes the market by storm, landing them on the cover of Inc., creating enormous personal wealth, and reminding stuffy executive types that hungry young upstarts can and will eat their lunch.\n\nThis stereotype has meaningful consequences. In Silicon Valley, for example, venture capitalists show a clear bias toward investing in younger founders, often leaving older founders out in the cold. The perceived link between youth and success is so prevalent that some tech workers reportedly seek plastic surgery to appear younger.\n\nPrime time for entrepreneurship is middle age\n\nBut the image of the young entrepreneur didn't hold when we looked at the data.\n\nPast studies of high-growth entrepreneurship and age have yielded conflicting results, based in part on small and selected data sets that researchers studied.\n\nTo examine the question more definitively, we conducted an internal project at the U.S. Census Bureau. That enabled us to examine all businesses launched in the U.S. between 2007 and 2014, encompassing 2.7 million founders. We compared founder age to firm performance measures, including employment and sales growth, as well as the \"exit\" by acquisition or IPO.\n\nSuccessful entrepreneurs are much more likely to be middle-aged, not young. For the top 0.1% of the fastest-growing new businesses in the U.S., the average age of the founder in the business' first year was 45.\n\nSimilarly, middle-aged founders dominate successful exits. By our estimation, a 50-year-old founder is 1.8 times more likely than a 30-year-old founder to create one of the highest-growth firms. Founders in their early 20s have the lowest likelihood of building a top-growth firm.\n\nWhy would entrepreneurs get better with age? It's not clear, but we have a few theories. More seasoned entrepreneurs may draw on greater experience in management or deeper industry-specific knowledge. They may also have greater financial resources and more relevant social networks to leverage the founder's business idea. For example, our study showed that prior work experience in the startup's specific industry more than doubled the chance of an upper-tail growth success.\n\nEven some of the most famous young founders tend to peak toward middle age. For example, Steve Jobs and Apple AAPL, +1.43% found their blockbuster innovation with the iPhone, released when Jobs was 52.\n\nChange the narrative\n\nBy continuing to associate entrepreneurship with youth, investors are likely betting too young. If venture capitalists and other early-stage investors take our findings to heart, they'll consider founders from a broader age range and may thereby back higher-growth firms.\n\nBy the same token, middle-aged would-be entrepreneurs may feel more confident about their chances - and more likely to win the resources they need to bring business visions to life.\n\nOn an even broader scale, the emphasis on young entrepreneurs has likely skewed innovation and its funding toward problems that the younger segment understands best. Updating views of the entrepreneur's life cycle - and peak performance within it - may shift innovation toward areas that older individuals know better.\n\nThe myth of the young entrepreneur is an age-old image, but perhaps one whose number is finally up.\n\nBenjamin F.

                "body": "U.S. stock futures were inching higher on Friday, with the Dow industrials poised to post the longest winning streak since late last year, as investors breathed a bit easier over inflation and dollar's swift pace of gains slowed.\n\nInvestors will hear from a Federal Reserve official and get updates on import prices and consumer sentiment.\n\nWhat are markets doing?\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average futures YMM8, +0.13% rose 42 points, or 0.2%, to 24,732, while S&P 500 futures ESM8, +0.11% inched up 3.8 points, or 0.1%, to 2,722.50. Nasdaq-100 futures NQM8, -0.03% turned higher, rising 1 point to 6,965.25.\n\nOn Thursday, the Dow industrials DJIA, +0.80% logged a sixth-straight positive session, the longest stretch in more than two months, rising 196.99 points, or 0.8%, to 24,739.53. A positive close Friday would make for the longest winning streak since the one that ended the week of Nov. 8, 2017.\n\nThe S&P 500 SPX, +0.94% and Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.89% each logged gains of 0.9% on Thursday. The tech-heavy index closed higher for a fifth straight session, its longest such streak since February.\n\nFor the week, stocks are poised to gain across the board. As of Thursday, the Dow was up 0.8%, the S&P 500 was up 2.2% and the Nasdaq was up 2.7%.\n\nRead: Here's why the stock market has its swagger back -- for now\n\nWhat is driving the markets?\n\nCooler U.S. consumer prices helped propel stocks Thursday, while lower bond yields and a weak dollar also lent a hand. Meanwhile, Wall Street's so-called \"fear gauge\" has been falling for the past five sessions, tapping its lowest level since late January.\n\nOn Friday, data on import prices for April are due at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, while the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for May is expected at 10 a.m. Eastern.\n\nSt. Louis Fed President James Bullard is due to deliver a speech on economic and monetary policy to the Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce in Springfield, Mo., at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.\n\nWhat are strategists saying?\n\n\"The important question is whether investors will look to take some profits off the table at this time, allowing the greenback to retreat slightly, but more importantly whether they will treat any pullback as an opportunity to buy the dip. In simpler terms, does the slowdown in inflation seen yesterday kill the chances for the Fed moving toward more rate hikes this year?\" said Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADS Securities, in a note to clients.\n\nWhat stocks are in focus?\n\nThe Trade Desk Inc. TTD, +2.35% was posed to climb, after a late-Thursday jump of 22% after the platform for managing digital-ad campaigns blew out earnings forecasts. It reported that streaming TV advertising surged nearly 2,000% over the year in the first quarter.\n\nRead: CEO of Trade Desk sees rapidly increased spending on connected TV ads\n\nShares of Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +1.70% could come under pressure after the chip maker's shares fell in late trade, even after the company reported results and an outlook that topped Wall Street's view.\n\nRead: Nvidia made more from crypto mining than AMD, but expects a bigger drop\n\nAnd: Nvidia CEO says self-driving pause, Tesla Model 3 issues didn't affect auto business\n\nDropbox Inc. DBX, +1.91% shares could extend late-Thursday losses after the cloud-storage company beat earnings and sales forecasts, but results weren't as blowout as Wall Street would have liked.\n\nPlus: Red-hot chip stocks are actually getting cheaper as their prices rise\n\nShares of PPG Industries Inc. PPG, -0.88% could extend a 3% late-session loss after the paint maker fired its controller and reassigned employees as it said it found additional accounting errors worth millions.\n\nApple Inc. AAPL, +1.43% and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, +0.71% could be in focus after a report in The Wall Street Journal are preparing to launch a new joint credit card.\n\nDrug stocks could be active ahead after the administration of President Donald Trump is expected to make a speech on drug prices on Friday.\n\nWhat are other markets doing?\n\nAsian markets finished the week mostly higher, except for a 0.3% drop for the Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, -0.35% while European stocks SXXP, -0.06% were pushing toward a seventh-straight weekly win.\n\nOil futures were pulling back from, with West Texas Intermediate crude CLM8, +0.03% down 0.3% to $71.18 a barrel, but still poised to gain 2% for the week.\n\nRead: Oil and the dollar are doing something they have only done 11 times in the past 35 years\n\nThe dollar DXY, -0.06% was largely flat against major currencies, while gold GCM8, +0.08% inched lower.",

                "title": "Here's why the stock market has its swagger back -- for now",
                "body": "Don't look now, but U.S. stocks are in a decided uptrend as a period of market anxieties appear to have faded -- at least for the moment.\n\nIn its wake is a rally that has the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.79% on track to match its longest win streak -- six straight days -- since a similar stretch ended Feb. 16, according to FactSet data. In fact, if the blue-chip benchmark musters a seventh consecutive romp in the green on Friday, it will equal its longest stretch of consecutive advances since Oct. 5.\n\nMeanwhile, the technology-rich Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.81% is poised to mark its longest string of victories since a seven-session stretch ended March 12.\n\nAnd the small-cap focused Russell 2000 index RUT, +0.44% is within a hair's breadth of setting its first record since Jan. 23, when it closed at 1,610.706, outperforming both the Dow and the large-cap oriented S&P 500 index SPX, +0.88% with investors deeming the segment of smaller companies more insulated to some of the consternations that have plagued Wall Street since February.\n\nIt is all impressive stuff, but it is unclear this run is sustainable. Meanwhile, there are a number of factors that investors say are underpinning the recent resurgence in risk-taking that's lifted the market.\n\nMuted inflation\n\nInflation was the culprit for roiling the market back in February, as fears that a pickup would force Jerome Powell's Federal Reserve to dial rates up faster than hoped for in 2018 -- a worrisome turn for stock investors compelled to revalue corporate cash flows and valuations at higher rates. Percolating inflation also is a pain point for bond prices, which move inversely to yields -- a factor that can also amplify already tightening financial conditions for U.S. corporations.\n\nHowever, Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Financial, said some of those worries have dissipated. Thursday's reading on consumer prices for April, came in at 0.1%, slightly below average estimates from economists surveyed by MarketWatch.\n\nMoreover, the 10-year Treasury yield, an debt instrument used to price everything from car loans to mortgages, has held below the round-number level at 3%, which also had worried investors back in late April.\n\nSolid first quarter earnings\n\nEarnings have widely been considered among the best in recent memory but had been mostly ignored by market participants, until now. Instead investors have fretted that the recent batch of first-quarter results may be as good as it gets for earnings.\n\nCheck out: First-quarter earnings season was great -- except for this small thing\n\nRead: The stock market is punishing companies that beat earnings forecasts -- here's what history says\n\nSo far, 90% of the S&P 500 companies have reported, with 78.7% delivering earnings-per-share results that have come in better-than-expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data. On average, 64% of companies outperform relative to estimates, based on data going back to 1994. What's more, only 14% of companies reported results in first quarter of this year have underperformed thus far, versus a historic norm of about 21%, Thomson Reuters notes.\n\nThose results come even as Wall Street analysts raised estimates to account for an expected bump for companies following the late-2017 passage of corporate tax cuts by President Donald Trump.\n\nCavanaugh makes the case that earnings haven't peaked and that second-quarter results may yet be equally good.\n\n\"In fact, in absolute terms, the second quarter dollar amount is actually higher than Q1 and estimates for Q2 growth have moved up to 19% and are likely to go higher,\" she wrote in a Thursday afternoon research note.\n\nOil's surge\n\nU.S. benchmark crude-oil CLM8, +0.37% has soared steadily to its highest level since November of 2014, breaking above a level at $71 a barrel. Although a rapid burst higher in crude could have knock-on effects for average consumers, driving inflation and prices higher, at the moment, they are helping to deliver a jolt to an energy sector that was all but forgotten last year, producing the worst performance among the S&P 500's 11 main sectors.\n\nRead: U.S. gasoline prices could top $3 this summer thanks to Iran and Venezuela\n\nPart of that rise is Trump's decision to take the U.S. out of the multilateral Iran nuclear pact, threatening to disrupt the oil supply chain. Another factor is a raft of production curbs instituted across the globe and led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The combination of those factors may have a lasting effect on oil prices and values for some of the biggest energy companies. That is highlighted by a popular exchange-traded Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF XLE, +0.81% which tracks some of the biggest energy names and is up 4.7% so far this week, marking its best weekly gain since April 20.\n\nSee: Why the unloved energy sector is primed for success\n\nTech-sector renaissance\n\nDon't call it comeback? Technology and internet stocks have shifted into higher gear, providing a key leg for equity benchmarks because those companies, including Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.43% and Facebook Inc. FB, +1.58% to name a few, tend to carry the biggest weight, and therefore have the most influence on the broad-market benchmarks.\n\nThey have started to recover, with Apple ringing up records in the past few sessions and Facebook returning to its trading level before its Cambridge Analytica scandal.\n\nAs MarketWatch's Ryan Vlastelica writes, tech and internet stocks have regained their crown.\n\nVolatility downtrend\n\nOne measure of volatility, the Cboe Volatility Index VIX, -1.56% is on track for its lowest close since Jan. 26, meaning it has completely erased the massive spike it saw in early February. Because the VIX, aka Wall Street's 'fear gauge', reflects S&P 500 bullish and bearish options bets in the coming 30 days, and slumps as stocks rise, it is often used as a litmus test for the degree of implied volatility.\n\nIn other words, the trend lower, with the VIX touching a level beneath 13 for the first time since January, and under its historic average at about 19.5, suggests that there are fewer wagers for further declines in the market. Perhaps, that is because there is more optimism brewing in the financial system.\n\nTrade wars and tariffs\n\nWorries about a trade conflict between the U.S. and China have subsided somewhat. Fears that the two largest economies could engage in a full-blown trade war have rattled investors' nerves because it is a scenario that Wall Street investors find unpredictable at best, and at worst one that could do damage to the global economy. On Thursday, reports suggested that some optimism was forming around the notion that Beijing and Washington could resolve their differences.\n\nRead: U.S.-China trade spat could produce unexpected winner: Latin America\n\nLong-term outlook\n\nTo be sure, this recent run-up doesn't mean that the stock market can sustain this break higher and it is hardly time to crack open the Champagne.\n\nBut at least things look good in the short term. \"The bears need to hibernate for a while because it looks like most of the geopolitical news has been priced in as well. One possible piece of negative news -- The Wall Street Journal reported today that beer sales are down. Oh no.,\" wrote Cavanaugh.",

                "body": "Alcoa Corporation (NYSE: AA) and Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO) today announced a revolutionary process to make aluminum that produces oxygen and eliminates all direct greenhouse gas emissions from the traditional smelting process.\n\nExecutives of Alcoa, Rio Tinto and Apple were joined by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Premier of Qu\u00e9bec Philippe Couillard for the announcement, which signals the most significant innovation in the aluminium industry in more than a century.\n\nTo advance larger scale development and commercialization of the new process, Alcoa and Rio Tinto are forming Elysis, a joint venture company to further develop the new process with a technology package planned for sale beginning in 2024.\n\nElysis, which will be headquartered in Montreal with a research facility in Quebec's Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region, will develop and license the technology so it can be used to retrofit existing smelters or build new facilities.\n\nWhen fully developed and implemented, it will eliminate direct greenhouse gas emissions from the smelting process and strengthen the closely integrated Canada-United States aluminum and manufacturing industry. The new joint venture company will also sell proprietary anode and cathode materials, which will last more than 30 times longer than traditional components.\n\nCanada and Quebec are each investing $60 million (CAD) in Elysis. The provincial government of Quebec will have a 3.5 percent equity stake in the joint venture with the remaining ownership split evenly between Alcoa and Rio Tinto.\n\nApple is providing an investment of $13 million (CAD). The company helped facilitate the collaboration between Alcoa and Rio Tinto on the carbon-free smelting process, and Apple has agreed to provide technical support to the JV partners.\n\nAlcoa and Rio Tinto will invest $55 million (CAD) cash over the next three years and contribute specific intellectual property and patents.\n\nThe patent-protected technology, developed by Alcoa, is currently producing metal at the Alcoa Technical Center, near Pittsburgh in the United States, where the process has been operating at different scales since 2009. The joint venture intends to invest up to $40 million (CAD) in the United States, which would include funding to support the supply chain for the proprietary anode and cathode materials.\n\nVincent Christ, an experienced leader with more than 30 years' experience at Rio Tinto Aluminium, has been named Chief Executive Officer of Elysis. Most recently, he has served as head of technology, research and development and automation programs. He holds an engineering degree in electronics and industrial information technology.\n\nQuotes:\n\n\"This discovery has been long sought in the aluminum industry, and this announcement is the culmination of the work from many dedicated Alcoa employees. Today, our history of innovation continues as we take aluminum's sustainable advantage to a new level with the potential to improve the carbon footprint of a range of products from cars to consumer electronics.\"\n\nAlcoa President and CEO Roy Harvey\n\n\"This is a revolutionary smelting process that can deliver a significant reduction in carbon emissions. It builds on the key role aluminium has to play in driving human progress, by making products infinitely recyclable, stronger, lighter and more fuel efficient. Rio Tinto is proud to work with Alcoa, Apple and the governments of Canada and Quebec, to drive an innovation that can transform the industry and our customers' supply chains.\"\n\nRio Tinto chief executive J-S Jacques\n\n\"Today's announcement will create and maintain thousands of jobs for Canadians, significantly reduce Canada's carbon footprint, and further strengthen the aluminum industry in North America. It is a truly historic day for the aluminum industry - and for all Canadian aluminum workers - who play such an important role in our economy and our country's future.\"\n\nPrime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau\n\n\"With the establishment of this new facility, Qu\u00e9bec will continue to lead the world in the development of advanced aluminium smelting technologies. Our investment will play a key role in the large scale development of this carbon-free aluminium smelting technology, so it can be deployed and deliver significant environmental benefits with well paid, highly skilled jobs here in Qu\u00e9bec.\"\n\nPremier of Qu\u00e9bec Philippe Couillard\n\n\"Apple is committed to advancing technologies that are good for the planet and help protect it for generations to come. We are proud to be part of this ambitious new project, and look forward to one day being able to use aluminum produced without direct greenhouse gas emissions in the manufacturing of our products.\"\n\nTim Cook, Apple CEO\n\nAlcoa (NYSE: AA) is a global industry leader in bauxite, alumina, and aluminum products, and is built on a foundation of strong values and operating excellence dating back nearly 130 years to the world-changing discovery that made aluminum an affordable and vital part of modern life. Since developing the aluminum industry, and throughout our history, our talented Alcoans have followed on with breakthrough innovations and best practices that have led to efficiency, safety, sustainability, and stronger communities wherever we operate.

                "body": "Facebook stock has erased nearly all its data-scandal losses\n\nThe U.S. stock market's longtime leader has regained its crown.\n\nThe information technology sector has been rallying thus far in May, a steep upward move that has returned it to near-record territory and helped it erase some of the pronounced weakness it saw earlier this year.\n\nThe sector XLK, +0.97% has gained 7.5% thus far this month, nearly twice as much as any of the other 11 primary S&P 500 sectors. (In second place is materials, up 3.9% over the same period.) The S&P 500 SPX, +0.76% itself is up 2.9% thus far in May, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.69% is up 2.5%. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.71% which maintains a heavier weighting toward large-capitalization technology and internet names, is up 4.8% over the same period.\n\nThe gains in the sector have been broad based, but two stocks in particular have stood out as lifting the overall industry.\n\nApple Inc. AAPL, +1.29% the largest stock in the market, has risen for nine straight sessions, its longest streak since July 2017. It is also poised for its fifth straight record close, the longest streak of that ilk since February 2015. The iPhone maker is up 14.8% thus far in May, if that level holds, this will represent its biggest monthly advance since February 2012.\n\nThe gain -- which has put Apple just 7.3% below an unprecedented market capitalization of $1 trillion -- had two primary catalysts. At the start of the month, Apple reported strong quarterly results, which included steep growth in China. Subsequently, billionaire investor Warren Buffett disclosed that he had bought 75 million Apple shares in the first quarter of the year, in what was seen as a massive bode of confidence in the stock.\n\n\"While his investment announcement may not have marked the bottom in the sector (with the most recent bottom reached on April 25) or for Apple's stock, it perhaps woke investors up to the idea that some value opportunities emerged within tech during the recent pullback,\" wrote Lindsey Bell, an investment strategist at CFRA.\n\nThe sector has come under pressure of late, with many investors worried that tech's big rally in 2017 had gotten overextended, with limited additional upside potential from levels that were seen as elevated.\n\nFurther weakness came with a scandal at Facebook Inc. FB, +1.41% over how the social-media giant had handled its user data. The controversy, and concerns that new regulations might be instituted against data-using tech companies, spilled into the stock, with shares falling into bear market territory -- or a drop of 20% from a peak.\n\nSince then, however, helped by a blowout earnings report, Facebook has almost entirely recovered those losses. It is up nearly 13% over the past month, and it sits less than 5% below record levels.\n\nRead: Facebook appears to be bulletproof after stellar earnings report\n\nAmong other recent tech outperformers, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.43% is up 4.5% thus far this month, while Google-parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +0.97% GOOG, +0.82% is up 8.6% -- both have significantly outperformed the broader market in May. Semiconductor stocks SOX, +1.33% have also done well, with the sector up 9% in May. Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +1.08% is up 15% thus far this month, while Advanced Micro Devices AMD, +1.09% is up 11.6%.\n\nOverall, the tech sector has posted revenue growth of 13.58% over the past year, according to FactSet data, well above the 9.69% growth of the S&P 500.",

GS, +0.96% are preparing to launch a new joint credit card, a move that would deepen the technology giant's push into its customers' wallets and mark the Wall Street firm's first foray into plastic.\n\nThe planned card would carry the Apple Pay brand and could launch early next year, people familiar with the matter said. Apple will replace its longstanding rewards-card partnership with BCS, +0.43% PLC, the people said.\n\nThe Apple-Goldman card could help the companies combat weaknesses in their core businesses. As new iPhone sales growth slows, Apple is focusing on services such as mobile payments, streaming-music subscriptions, and App Store sales. Apple Pay, which generates revenue on each transaction, is a key contributor, but adoption has been slower than executives hoped.\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com\n\nPopular on WSJ.com\n\nNorth Korea Frees Three U.S. Citizens\n\nIsrael Strikes Iranian Targets in Syria as Regional Tensions Mount",

                "title": "Confused about these investing terms? You're not alone",
                "body": "If you've ever scanned the business headlines, you're probably familiar with terms like the S&P 500, ETFs and bull markets. But do you actually know what they mean, or how they compare to related investing lingo like the Dow, mutual funds and bear markets?\n\nIf you said no, you've got plenty of company. In one recent Bankrate survey, nearly half of those 25 and younger said a lack of knowledge about investing kept them from putting money in the market. And in a recent Harris Poll, 69% of adults 35 and younger said they found investing, and the accompanying jargon, complex and confusing.\n\nSo we've rounded up 19 common investing terms you've probably heard, but may not really understand, and given you the lowdown on all of them.\n\nBear vs. bull market\n\nA bull market is when everything is just wonderful: Markets are on the rise and investors are confident that strong results will continue. Though the market can have \"bullish\" days, technically, a bull market is when the market increases in value at least 20%. Hint: Bull market means \"up\" because real-life bulls attack by driving their horns up in the air.\n\nA bear market is the inverse: The market -- and investor confidence -- is declining. The job and housing markets may also be down. The upside, however is that bear markets are a bonanza for savvy investors, as prices have recovered historically (and then some) after every bear market. You can remember that it means \"down\" because bears attack their victims by swiping their paws downward.\n\nStock vs. bond\n\nStocks, or shares of a publicly traded company, are a fundamental element of most investment portfolios. The value goes up and down with the company's financial well-being -- and with shareholders' perception of that company's well-being. They're risky, but potentially rewarding.\n\nBonds are essentially loans that you give to the issuer, which can be a corporation, municipality or the federal government. When you buy, you do so with the expectation of getting paid back, with interest, in a certain amount of time -- criteria that render bonds a low-risk, if boring investment.\n\nETFs vs. mutual funds\n\nAn ETF is a stock, bond or commodity fund that usually tracks an index. Because they're more passively run, they tend to charge lower fees. They're also traded like common stocks at varying prices throughout the day.\n\nA mutual fund -- which pools your money with other investors to purchase stocks, bonds and other assets -- is professionally managed and therefore tends to come with higher fees. Shares are priced once based on their net asset value (NAV) at the end of the trading day.\n\nMoney market vs. savings account\n\nA money market account (MMA) is a bank account that typically pays a higher interest rate than checking and many savings accounts (for which the average interest rate is currently less than .50%). MMAs have check-writing abilities, as well as ATM or debit cards; and, like savings accounts, federal regulations restrict you to no more than six withdrawals a month. There's usually a higher minimum balance requirement for MMAs compared with savings accounts.\n\nPassive vs. active funds\n\nCalling an investment fund \"passive\" or \"active\" refers to how it's managed. Passive funds are run with a hands-off approach, and therefore generally come with lower fees. Index funds, for example, are set up to move in tandem with associated indexes, like the S&P 500, and mirror their returns.\n\nActive funds, on the other hand, are handled by investment managers, who attempt to beat their benchmarks by making a wider variety of investments. You'll pay more in fees in exchange for their expertise.\n\nGrowth vs. value stocks\n\nGrowth or value? Both, if you want a balanced investment portfolio.\n\nGrowth stocks have a recent history of above-average performance. While all signs suggest these investments (think: newer companies, especially ones in the tech sector) will continue growing, they're risky because you're solely relying on the company's success for your investment to appreciate.\n\nValue stocks are investments that trade at a lower price than their fundamentals, like high dividend payments and company earnings, might indicate. That effectively puts these stocks in the bargain bin, and savvy investors may be able to capitalize.\n\nInvesting vs. trading\n\nBoth investing and trading are means to the same goal: making money from the financial markets. Yet they represent different functions.\n\nInvesting typically refers to \"buy and hold,\" meaning investors create a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds, and hold on to them for the long-term -- gaining from the power of compound interest and weathering the natural up-and-down market cycles.\n\nTrading, by contrast, is a much more active effort to profit, requiring a trader to frequently buy and sell investments with the aim of beating out buy-and-hold investors. It also comes with more risks.\n\n401(k) vs. IRA\n\nA 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement savings account, where you can contribute a maximum of $18,000 pretax ($24,000 if you're over 50) in 2016. As an incentive to save, many employers match a portion of your contributions. (Free money!)\n\nAn IRA, which stands for individual retirement account, is accessible to anyone. This year, you can contribute up to $5,500 pretax (plus another $1,000 if you're 50 or older) in a traditional IRA.\n\nWith a few notable exceptions, you'll pay a 10% penalty for withdrawing funds from either of these retirement accounts before age 59\u00bd.\n\nRoth IRAs are a bit different. Provided you don't earn more than the income limits, you can contribute up to $5,500 ($1,000 more if you're 50 or older) posttax dollars, but it grows tax-free. You're allowed to withdraw funds you contribute -- but not any gains -- anytime without penalty.\n\nS&P 500 vs. Dow vs. Nasdaq\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, DJIA, +0.75% a.k.a \"the Dow,\" is an index that tracks 30 large, established, U.S.-based companies across all sectors. Today, these include companies like 3M, MMM, +0.83% Coca-Cola, COKE, -21.17% Apple, AAPL, +0.70% Nike NKE, -0.74% and Walmart. WMT, -3.13% As such, the state of the Dow often serves as a general pulse of the economy in the minds of the media, investors and general public.\n\nWhen people refer to \"The Nasdaq,\" NDAQ, +1.96% they're typically talking about the Nasdaq Composite -- a price-weighted index of more than 3,000 companies listed on the exchange of the same name. Because it's is so much bigger than the Dow, a glance at the day's Nasdaq can give a broader view of the economy, though it's skewed toward the tech sector.\n\nThe S&P 500 refers to the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which includes, yes, 500 primarily large-cap stocks selected by a team of analysts and economists at Standard & Poor's. It's often used as a benchmark for the stock market because it includes a significant portion of the market's total value.\n\nRead the original article on Grow.",

                "body": "The biggest capex spenders -- tech firms among them -- tend to 'destroy alpha,' say analysts\n\nAfter many years of growing profits through cost cutting, American corporations are finally embracing organic growth with capital expenditures.\n\nIn aggregate that's good news for the market, but there will be winners and losers, according to analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nThanks to a corporate tax windfall there's been a surge in capex spending by large corporations during the first quarter of this year. It's likely to persist for some time, say analysts.\n\nSpending \"more on capex\" has been the most prevalent guidance from S&P 500 SPX, +0.15% companies around tax reform proceeds so far, according to the Bank of America division.\n\nIndeed, aggregate capex in the first quarter of 2018 grew 24% year over year, 5 percentage points above expectations at the start of the year and about three times the growth rate in the fourth quarter of last year, the analysts said.\n\nRead: Here's what tax reform, so far, has meant for the stock market and the economy\n\nBut it isn't just the tax cut that is driving capex higher.\n\n\"Our work suggests companies build when accelerating demand butts up against capacity constraints, which may be where we are now -- especially for tech companies,\" the report said.\n\nIn other words, with unemployment at the lowest levels in decades and the economy picking up steam, companies are forced to either hire more workers, raise wages to attract and retain workers or invest in automation to boost productivity.\n\nOpinion: Ranking Amazon, Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft in the race to $1 trillion in market value\n\nUntil recently it was \"old economy\" companies that were spending steadily on technology, such as computer equipment or software. This time around, it's tech companies spending on infrastructure and driving overall growth in capex. By far, the biggest spenders in the first quarter were the large technology companies that are building new campuses, headquarters or warehouses.\n\nSee also: Here's why an earnings peak doesn't mean it's all downhill for the stock market\n\n\"Capex growth this quarter was led by the tech [sector], with tech capex growth tracking 75% year-over-year in the first quarter. Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +1.49% is a big driver, but even ex-Alphabet, tech is at the higher end of spending compared with the other sectors. And tech companies' guidance on capex is three times as bullish as for the rest of the S&P 500,\" said the analysts.\n\nBut this is where investors should be cautious: the biggest capex spenders tend to \"destroy alpha,\" according to the note.\n\n\"In all 10 sectors, companies with the highest capex-to-sales ratio were penalized rather than rewarded,\" said Jill Carey Hall, equity and quant strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in an interview with MarketWatch.\n\nHall and her team looked at performance data going back to 1986 and found companies with the highest capex-to-sales ratio would have underperformed the market by 2.2 percentage points a year since 1986.\n\nThat means, that current darlings, such as large technology companies are likely to underperform, adding to a long list of reasons for being cautious on the sector.\n\nOpinion: Don't blindly follow Warren Buffett into Apple stock",

                "title": "Disney's approach to streaming ESPN could  determine the future of television",
                "body": "With ESPN+ and a new app, Disney could solidify cable's 'skinny bundles' by supplementing with streaming subscriptions\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. could break the cable bundle completely. Instead, Disney is going to collect some of the money that runs through its channels while building streaming ammunition in case a war with the bundlers ever happens.\n\nThat is why the recent launch of the ESPN+ streaming service in a new ESPN app are important in the continuing transformation of how video content is consumed. It is the first step in Disney's DIS, -0.67% role in supporting and helping solidify a new normal for how we will interact with our televisions: Taking the additional targeted \"tiers\" and other goodies that cable companies have traditionally offered and selling them directly to consumers in separate apps.\n\nOpinion: The ESPN streaming service is not new, Disney just wants you to pay for it\n\nIn the traditional cable system, companies like Comcast Corp. CMCSA, -5.56% would sell consumers a base collection of channels, then offer smaller bundles aimed at specific interests, such as sports, for additional monthly fees. The content providers who produced the channels were paid, which made Disney -- and especially ESPN, with more than a half-dozen channels that could be the base of additional sports tiers -- a monster money machine.\n\nAs consumers have moved away from the bundle and toward ad-free streaming services like Netflix Inc. NFLX, +0.19% , ESPN has lost subscribers just as the price of live sports content has skyrocketed because fans will watch games live and stomach the commercials that come with it. That squeeze from both sides -- lower revenue, higher costs -- has damaged Disney's stock price, but not enough for Disney to go nuclear with a streaming ESPN option that would forego the billions it collects from cable companies.\n\nInstead, we have reached a middle ground. Cable companies and other providers are offering \"skinny bundles,\" mobile-friendly packages that offer fewer channels at a lower price. While many of those offer the same additional tiers as their larger predecessors, consumers are instead supplementing with Netflix or other streaming services, most of which are not the traditional content providers like Disney.\n\nDon't miss: Netflix is growing at a stunning rate -- and so is its profit\n\nDisney has decided that a system of smaller bundles and outside additions is the future, buying a majority stake in streaming-technology company BamTech to deliver its own on-demand services. The first offspring of that marriage is ESPN+, which will be followed next year by a Disney offering that includes popular content that will eventually be removed from Netflix.\n\nWhile the ESPN+ that Disney announced ahead of launch mostly comprised sports and content that subscribers already had access to, it is rapidly growing with the addition of niche sports and targeted studio shows. The plan feels similar both to ESPN's beginning as a cable network in the early 1980s -- when sports like lacrosse and low-budget studio shows were the norm -- and the approach on its website, which parcels out the wonkiest content for hard-core fans into a subscription plan called ESPN Insider.\n\nAt a media event in Oakland, Calif., just after the launch last month, ESPN executives stressed that ESPN+ was a work in progress, with plenty of plans for studio shows and new deals aimed at these niche fans. They especially played up deals for boxing, American soccer leagues and cricket, and discussed potential additions of more content.\n\nESPN proved executives weren't blowing smoke Tuesday morning with the biggest addition to ESPN+ yet. The company landed a five-year deal with UFC, the mixed martial-arts league that has devoted followers, for 15 fights and an assortment of series and studio shows to be aired on ESPN+. Most important, it will include the rights to sell pay-per-view fights, an additional avenue for ESPN to collect viewers' money.\n\nDisney Chief Executive Robert Iger had previously hinted that ESPN+ could move into pay-per-view for specific events, but UFC will be the first test. That is Disney taking yet another moneymaker that has typically been the domain of cable companies for itself, cutting out a middleman and helping to make up for the lost ESPN subscription fees while setting ESPN+ to eventually become something much more than it is now.\n\nRead: With Fox merger and ESPN streaming effort, Disney has a confusing mess to sort out\n\n\"Our goal here is to create a sports marketplace on ESPN+, and that will include a number of sports that we've already licensed and sports that we are in the process of licensing, including the deal that we announced today, as well as the sum of the sports that we would be acquiring as part of the 21st Century Fox FOX, -0.08% acquisition and then there are opportunities to license beyond what we've already done,\" Iger said in a conference call Tuesday after Disney reported second-quarter earnings.\n\nDisney could try a similar approach with its other streaming service, which will include premium content from Marvel, \"Star Wars\" studio Lucasfilm, Pixar and its own Disney-branded material. For instance, it could sell or rent its movies not long after they leave movie theaters, or even while they are still in theaters, avoiding any of the typical \"windows\" for such content that offers middlemen exclusive time periods to rent or sell such content. Many consumers are currently renting or buying digital movies through Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.48% or Alphabet Inc.'s GOOGL, -0.08% GOOG, -0.08% Google services, and Disney could aim to cut them out just as it has Netflix.\n\nSee also: Netflix sees sharks approaching from both sides in Apple and Disney\n\n\"In order for [the Disney streaming service] to be successful longer term, it has to become the destination to watch Disney, Marvel, 'Star Wars,' and Pixar product,\" Iger said Tuesday. \"And that means ultimately weaning ourselves of product being available any other place except for the current linear channels that are in the marketplace.\"\n\nThe key for Disney is to be in control of its own future, so it is not caught flat-footed if the video ecosystem continues to undergo seismic change. In a few years, it could theoretically bundle all its assets into a direct-to-consumer offering that completely bypasses the bundle, or just continue on the path of picking off easy money from others to make up for lost fees from cable subscribers. Either way, it has power in negotiations with cable companies desperate to stay in consumers' lives.\n\nFor those consumers, the approach means the dream of full a-la-carte television purchasing is not in sight, and the current version is not always easy to use. The new ESPN app, for example, requires a user to sign in with an ESPN account for ESPN+, and a cable login for access to streams of content airing on linear networks. ESPN has a deal with Major League Baseball, which created BamTech, to stream its MLB.TV package of games on the platform, but launched without the ability for current MLB subscribers to access that content due to technical issues involving all the different authentications.\n\nThe result so far is a reorganized bundle spread across different apps with separate billing -- a more confusing system that at least has more on-demand options and choice, and works on a multitude of devices. If that system is where the future of television lies, thank (or blame) Disney.\n\nDisney shares declined about 1% in late trading Tuesday after the company reported earnings. The stock has declined 8.6% in the past year, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.01% , which counts Disney as a component, has gained 16%.",

                "body": "Retail volume 'leapt to the highest levels in at least a decade' in early 2018: Goldman\n\nThe U.S. stock market has seen volatility rear up in 2018, with major indexes experiencing wild swings on a nearly daily basis. There have been a number of causes often cited for the recent bout of turbulence, including concerns over inflation, geopolitical uncertainty, and the first-quarter earnings season, but one of Wall Street's most prominent investment banks fingers one key culprit: Main Street.\n\nCiting both their outsize ownership of stocks and a surge in recent trading activity, Goldman attributed the recent whipsawing trading in the equity market to average investors, writing that retail investors -- as opposed to institutional ones -- \"appear to have driven much of the U.S. equity market turbulence in late March and April.\"\n\nWhile retail investors individually control small amounts of money relative to portfolio managers or other professional market participants, their collective influence in the market is sizable. Per Goldman's data, households directly own 36% of the $46 trillion U.S. equity market, more than any other type of owner, and their share rises to more than 50% if you include indirect ownership through mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. (Mutual funds own 24% of U.S. stocks, while ETFs own 6%.)\n\nRelated: Why ETFs can't be blamed for the correction or volatility in stocks\n\nRetail activity in the market has also been rising, Goldman writes, which measured retail trading by calculating daily customer activity data from major retail brokerages like TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. AMTD, +1.15% Charles Schwab Corp. SCHW, +0.58% and E*Trade Financial Corp. ETFC, +1.27%\n\n\"Retail investors have long accounted for the bulk of U.S. equity ownership, but their share of trading has surged in early 2018,\" according to Goldman, adding that \"It leapt to the highest levels in at least a decade, both in absolute terms and scaled relative to total [New York Stock Exchange] trading activity.\"\n\nThat surge in trading occurred at a time when composite trading volumes were otherwise low. March and April also marked \"blackout\" periods for many U.S. companies, meaning they halted their stock buyback programs in the lead-up to the reporting of their quarterly results, temporarily removing a primary source buyer for the broader market.\n\nThose factors meant that retail trading had a bigger impact on overall trading, which contributed to the market's volatility, in Goldman's estimation.\n\nThus far this year, the Cboe Volatility Index VIX, -0.27% one closely tracked measure of volatility, is up 33.6%, although at 14.75 it remains below its long-term average. The gauge, which reflects bullish and bearish bets on the S&P 500 index for the coming 30 days, tends to climb as stocks fall. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.01% is down 1.5% in 2018 while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.03% is off 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.02% is up 5.2%. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 are in correction territory, and have been for their longest stretch since the financial crisis.\n\nThere were fundamental reasons for the market's moves, even if they were exacerbated by factors like the corporate blackout period. In early February, the equity market dropped on concerns that inflation was returning to the economy. Further volatility was pegged to uncertainty over trade policy, among other factors that have whipsawed stocks even as benchmarks have maintained a tight trading range\n\n\"Retail investors apparently reduced positions in their favorite stocks as well as broad equity market exposure; the popular stocks underperformed at the same time as U.S. equity mutual funds and ETFs experienced large-scale outflows,\" Goldman wrote. \"Trading favorites\" is based on fund position filing and Google Trends data, the investment bank wrote; the list of such stocks includes Netflix Inc. NFLX, +0.19% Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.48% Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.48% Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +0.69% Activision Blizzard ATVI, -1.08% among others.\n\nDon't miss: Here's why small-cap stocks could be vulnerable to ETF outflows",

To get this column each market day, click here.\n\nTechnically speaking, the major U.S. benchmarks have extended the May rally attempt, placing notable resistance under siege.\n\nOn a headline basis, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have effectively nailed trendline resistance, and the prevailing retests, still underway, will likely set the near-term technical tone.\n\nBefore detailing the U.S. markets' wider view, the S&P 500's SPX, -0.28% hourly chart highlights the past two weeks.\n\nAs illustrated, the S&P has rallied to increasingly familiar resistance.\n\nMonday's close (2,672.6) matched the 2017 close (2,673) and registered slightly under the 50-day moving average, currently 2,679.\n\nThis area more broadly matches trendline resistance pinned to the March peak.\n\nSimilarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has rallied to the range top.\n\nHere again, the index remains capped by the 50-day moving average, currently 24,440.\n\nOn further strength, additional resistance (24,526) matches the bottom of the March gap.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite's near-term backdrop remains stronger.\n\nAs illustrated, the index has reclaimed the 50-day moving average, reaching nearly three-week highs.\n\nThe breakout originates from the 2017 peak -- roughly, the 7,000 mark -- and opens the path to major resistance, better illustrated below.\n\nWidening the view to six months adds perspective.\n\nOn this wider view, the Nasdaq has reached a notable technical test.\n\nConsider that significant resistance matches three areas, detailed previously:\n\nTrendline resistance closely matching the April closing peak of 7,295. The absolute April peak of 7,319. Resistance matching the March gap, spanning from 7,303 to 7,325.\n\nCombined, resistance broadly spans from about 7,295 to 7,325.\n\nMonday's session high (7,292) closely matched resistance, and the retest remains underway.\n\nAn eventual close higher would negate the Nasdaq's developing head-and-shoulders top. This is a bearish pattern defined by the January, March and April peaks.\n\nLooking elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is rising from major support.\n\nConsider that the May low (23,531), established Thursday, effectively matched the Dow's 2018 closing low (23,533).\n\nThe subsequent rally from support punctuates a second successful test of the 200-day moving average.\n\nAdditional overhead broadly spans from the 50-day moving average, currently 24,440, to the 2017 close (24,719).\n\nSimilarly, the S&P 500 has staged a bullish reversal, rising from last week's shaky, but successful, test of the 200-day moving average.\n\nRecall that trendline resistance closely matches the 2017 close (2,673). To reiterate, Monday's close (2,672.6) matched resistance, and the retest remains underway.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nAs detailed above, the U.S. benchmarks' prevailing rally attempt has placed significant technical tests in play.\n\nOn a headline basis, the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 have effectively nailed well-defined trendlines, and the prevailing retests, across the next several sessions, should be a useful bull-bear gauge.\n\nMoving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM, +0.00% remains the strongest widely-tracked U.S. benchmark, in the broad sweep.\n\nStill, the IWM is traversing a jagged six-month range. The 2017 peak (155.41) effectively bisects the prevailing range, and the small-cap benchmark has ticked higher amid decreased volume.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P MidCap 400 is pressing trendline resistance, circa 347.\n\nOn further strength, additional overhead spans from 349.16 to 349.75, levels matching the 2017 peak and the April closing peak. An eventual close higher would strengthen the bull case.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the S&P 500's pending technical tests remain relatively straightforward.\n\nTo start, major S&P 500 resistance broadly spans from 2,673 to 2,695, levels matching the 2017 close and the 2017 peak.\n\nThis area also matches trendline resistance and the 50-day moving average, currently 2,679. A close higher would mark progress.\n\nOn further strength, more distant resistance (2,710) closely matches the top of the March gap and the April closing peak. An eventual close higher would mark a \"higher high\" more firmly signaling a trend shift.\n\nBeyond specific levels, the bigger picture technicals remain bearish-leaning based on today's backdrop.\n\nMarket rally attempts have been fueled by lackluster volume and breadth against the backdrop of less-than-ideal sector participation. (For instance, energy and large-cap technology have paced recent strength amid lackluster transports and financials participation.)\n\nThe pending tests of trendline resistance may add color.\n\nSee also: Charting a bearish market backdrop as seasonal headwind (May) kicks off.\n\nTuesday's Watch List\n\nThe charts below detail names that are technically well positioned. These are radar screen names -- sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library.\n\nDrilling down further, the iShares China Large-Cap ETF FXI, +1.12% remains tenuously positioned.\n\nRecall that major support matches the range bottom, technically spanning from about 45.50 to 46.00.\n\nThis area roughly matches the 200-day moving average, currently 46.50.\n\nLast week's low (45.65) closely matched major support, and the retest remains underway.\n\nMore broadly, the shares are threatening to resolve a bearish descending triangle with a downside break. Consider that Monday marked the first close under the 200-day moving average since January 4, 2017.\n\nConversely, trendline resistance closely tracks the 50-day moving average, currently 47.35. An eventual close higher would strengthen the backdrop\n\nMeanwhile, the iShares Europe ETF IEV, -0.19% remains relatively stronger, though the prevailing backdrop does not scream \"raging bull.\"\n\nThe shares initially spiked four weeks ago, clearing the 200- and 50-day moving averages, and ultimately reaching three-month highs. (The \"higher high\" combined with the rally atop the trending indicators is consistent with a trend shift.)\n\nBy comparison, the ensuing pullback has been flat, underpinned by the major moving averages.\n\nTactically, the 50-day moving average has marked an inflection point, and the recovery attempt is intact barring a violation.\n\nMoving to specific names, Tableau Software, Inc. DATA, +1.88% is a well positioned large-cap name.\n\nAs illustrated, the shares have recently gapped to two-year highs, rising after the company's strong first-quarter results.\n\nThe subsequent pullback has been comparably flat, underpinned by the top of the gap. Deeper support matches the breakout point, circa 87.50, and a sustained posture higher supports a firmly bullish bias.\n\nCoupa Software, Inc. COUP, +2.65% is a mid-cap name positioned to rise.\n\nTechnically, the shares are challenging a two-month range top, tagging a nominal all-time high this week.\n\nThe May upturn has been fueled by increased volume -- and comes from a tight range, underpinned by the 50-day moving average -- laying the groundwork for a potentially more decisive breakout. A near-term target projects to the 53 area on follow-through.\n\nPulteGroup, Inc. PHM, -0.18% is a large-cap homebuilder showing signs of life.\n\nLate last month, the shares rallied to the range top, rising on increased volume after the company's quarterly results.\n\nThe shares have subsequently held tightly to resistance, closely matching the 100-day moving average, improving the chances of eventual follow-through.\n\nTactically, near-term support matches the May low (30.20) and a breakout attempt is in play barring a violation.\n\nNow, Inc. DNOW, -0.49% is a mid-cap oil services name.\n\nEarlier this month, the shares knifed to nine-month highs, rising after the company's first-quarter results. The breakout punctuated a bull flag, underpinned by the 200-day moving average.\n\nThough still near-term extended, and due to consolidate, the nearly straightline strong-volume spike is longer-term bullish. Tactically, near-term support (13.80) is followed by the deeper breakout point (13.00).\n\nEditor's Note: This is a free edition of The Technical Indicator, a daily MarketWatch subscriber newsletter.

AAPL, +0.05% reversed earlier losses to rise 0.2% in midday trade Tuesday, putting them on track for a seventh-straight gain as they head toward another record high. The win streak would be the longest since the nine-session stretch through July 19, 2017. Apple's stock has run up 14.3% during its win streak, the best seven-day performance since it hiked up 14.5% in the seven days ending April 28, 2014. Helping give the stock a boost during its streak, has been Apple's better-than-expected earnings report last week and an endorsement from famed billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who said he bought another 75 million Apple shares during the first quarter. The stock, which was down as much as 0.8% at its intraday low before turning higher, has now climbed 19.6% over the past three months, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 SPX, -0.16% has rallied 8.0% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.14% has tacked on 2.1%.",

                "body": "Buyback authorizations have spiked, but capex growth has been more muted\n\nNow that the dust is starting to settle, what kind of report card does tax reform deserve?\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, signed into law in December 2017, was widely considered to be one of the most impactful -- and market friendly -- pieces of legislation to be passed in several years. It sharply cut corporate tax rates and featured a plan to repatriate the untaxed profits of U.S. firms held overseas, two aims that Wall Street rallied in anticipation of. Both of these attributes, proponents argued, would lead to businesses ramping up their investments and fueling the next stage of growth by further boosting the already strong jobs market and lifting wages.\n\nSince the passage, however, concerns about the economy's prospects have grown rather than eased, and rather than spurring an acceleration in economic growth or hiring, many economic indicators have shown signs of slowing or stalling. U.S. GDP growth came in at 2.3% in the first quarter, below the 3% average of the previous three quarters as consumer spending hit its weakest level in five years. Recent data on the labor market showed fewer jobs created in April than had been expected, and 2018's monthly average thus far is roughly in line with the average over recent years.\n\n\"To the extent we had exuberance about the tax bill between November and January, our view is now much more guarded. The biggest immediate impact is on earnings, but it's important for us to see where the money is spent,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities, referring to the repatriated cash. \"We want to see a good balance that includes capital expenditures, not just buyback and dividends.\"\n\nRelated: Why the Disney deal suggests the tax bill may mean little for the economy\n\nHogan, along with other analysts and market experts, agreed that too little time had passed since the bill's passage to fairly analyze the impact it was having on the economy. However, they also said that anyone expecting an immediate spike in hiring or investments would've been disappointed.\n\n\"The place you're seeing the impact show up the quickest is in stock buybacks, because that's the easiest to do,\" said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. \"Longer term you'll see companies make bigger investment plans, but that may not show up for three to six quarters. The impact of the law should be fine from that point of view; to the extent that companies reinvest, that should extend the bull market.\"\n\nCompanies have been aggressively returning cash to shareholders since the bill's passage. According to data from Goldman Sachs, companies in the S&P 500 SPX, -0.20% have authorized $205 billion in buyback programs thus far this year, which represents growth of 48%. For the full year, the investment bank expects $650 billion to be spent on buybacks, up 23% from 2017. In addition, investors received a record $109.2 billion in dividend payouts in the first quarter; S&P Dow Jones Indices estimated that S&P components could spend as much as $1 trillion on buyback and dividend programs this year.\n\nAmong notable examples, Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.08% last week announced a $100 billion buyback program and raised its dividend by 16%.\n\nOpinion: Apple's share buyback is a smarter use of its cash than these 4 other options\n\nSuch programs can boost shareholder returns in the short term, however, they are not seen as having a significant direct impact on demand or broader economic growth.\n\nCapital expenditures do contribute to growth, but the outlook on this front isn't as rosy as the buyback picture. According to Credit Suisse, capex grew 20.1% in the first quarter of 2018, hitting an estimated $162 billion. However, the spending was highly concentrated: two internet companies accounted for one third of the growth, while just ten stocks made up two thirds of the total.\n\n\"It's easy to attribute the recent increase to accelerated depreciation under the new tax plan, or the repatriation of overseas capital, but that would be a gross oversimplification,\" wrote Jonathan Golub, the firm's chief U.S. equity strategist.\n\nGoldman Sachs forecast 2018 capex growth of 10%, or less than half the growth it expects in repurchasing programs.\n\nLearn more: Businesses are investing more, but it's not the tax cut\n\nAgain, evaluating the law's impact mere months after it was enacted may create a misleading picture. New York Fed President William Dudley said it would be \"shocking\" if the tax bill didn't boost business spending, and that the only question was \"how much\" it would rise by. He added that it was too soon since the bill was passed for any pickup in investment to be seen in economic data.\n\n\"We're expecting a 20-30% increase in capex, and some of that growth is being driven by the fiscal picture improving,\" said Jeff Mills, co-chief investment strategist at PNC Financial Services Group. \"However, some of it was going to happen anyway, and can't be pegged to the tax bill.\"\n\nThe Wells Fargo Investment Institute recently wrote that the U.S. economy was entering the late stage of its business cycle, but that \"the passage of tax reform in December 2017 could help further extend the cycle's life span.\"\n\nThe lower tax rate did provide an immediate boost to corporate profits. Compared with the current profit growth rate of about 22%, Goldman estimated that growth would've been 9% had the bill not been passed. Results in the first quarter have been historically strong, but analysts aren't wholly positive on the what the bill did to corporate America's profit picture.\n\n\"The tax cut last year has created a lower quality increase in U.S. earnings growth that almost guarantees a peak rate of change by [the third quarter],\" Morgan Stanley wrote. \"Furthermore, the second order effects of said tax cuts are not all positive. Specifically, while an increase in capital spending and wages creates a revenue opportunity for some, it also creates higher costs for most. The net result is lower margins, particularly since the tax benefit is 100% 'below the line.'\"\n\nDon't miss: The tax bill accelerated the bull market -- and may make its end more painful\n\nAccording to a survey of small business owners conducted by TD Bank, 48% of respondents said the tax bill wouldn't benefit their businesses, while 20% actually cited it as their top obstacle for the year, second only to the 27% who cited \"the health of the national economy.\" While 22% of the small business owners polled plan to hire staff this year -- compared with the 9% that did in 2017's survey -- even the bill's supports indicated only a measured impact. Just 13% said they would purchase new equipment as a result of the bill.",

                "body": "Not only has Warren Buffett bought more Apple stock, he has been promoting the purchase with full force. Apple's stock, as a result, has jumped.\n\nThe day before the news of Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B, -0.23% buying more Apple AAPL, -0.08% stock broke (May 4), I wrote a column titled \"There's evidence that Apple's stock could finally break out.\"\n\nNo, Buffett did not call me before he unveiled the news. It is simply that I have been reading charts for over 30 years and can understand stock patterns. Furthermore, algorithms at The Arora Report showed several times during the first quarter that the smart money (professional investors) was buying Apple.\n\nRead: Four Warren Buffett mistakes that can make you a better investor\n\nInvestors are buying Apple stock hand over fist after Buffett revealed his additional purchases. But before you jump into Apple stock now, consider five points that may give pause, even to Buffett admirers like me. Let's start with a chart.\n\nChart\n\nPlease click here for an annotated chart of Apple. For the sake of full transparency, this is exactly the same chart, without any changes, that was published the day before Buffett's announcement. Please note the following from the chart:\n\n* During the first quarter, Apple traded as low as $155.03 and appears to have traded close to $150 during the time outside regular trading hours.\n\n* Buffett did not buy Apple stock around $185 but likely much lower.\n\n* Buffett is already sitting on a nice gain on his newly bought Apple stock. The more he talks about Apple stock, the bigger his gain gets. Buffett, in other words, is talking up his own book.\n\n* The chart shows that the volume during the period Buffett bought Apple stock was low. In the low-volume environment, it appears that about one in 10 shares were bought by Buffett or by Apple. Apple has an active share-repurchase program in place.\n\n* Without buying by Buffett and Apple, Apple stock would likely have not rallied and may have even declined.\n\n* Not shown on the chart (because it has been left unchanged for full transparency), but discernable from the chart, is the $171.48 level. This is the average price that Apple appears to have paid for the shares that it bought.\n\n* The horizontal resistance line shown on the chart has been broken but not decisively.\n\n* The resistance shown on the chart formed by the upper trend line has been touched but not decisively broken.\n\n* The chart shows that, periodically, Apple does pull back. Usually a pullback happens after extreme euphoria -- like what's happening now. A case in point is in 2012, when Apple stock topped $100 and The Arora Report gave a signal to sell some shares, which turned out to be the exact top. Subsequently Apple stock lost about half of its value. The signal saved many investors a lot of heartache and enabled them to add the stock again at one-half of the price. Please see \"Smart money selling Apple.\" Such an extreme drop in Apple stock is not likely in the near future because of the massive buyback program of its own stock by Apple. However, smaller dips are part of the natural process.\n\nAsk Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies. Have a question? Send it to Nigam Arora.\n\n10-fold return\n\nGoing forward, Apple is not likely to provide the kind of return it has provided in the past. For example, the original position of The Arora Report is from $18.73 and now there is 889% return on that. There are opportunities other than Apple that may provide similar large returns going forward.\n\nDiversification\n\nBuffett holds only one tech stock and that is Apple. Buffett has sold his IBM IBM, -0.25% position. Most investors are well-advised to diversify their technology holdings. Many investors are already overly concentrated in tech stocks such as Amazon AMZN, -0.56% Facebook FB, -0.22% Google GOOG, -0.46% GOOGL, -0.46% and Microsoft MSFT, -0.64%\n\nTime horizon\n\nBuffett can afford to sit on Apple stock forever. This is not the case for most investors. Individual investors often have personal reasons to sell in a time frame that is shorter than Buffett's. Institutional investors often sell because of diversification reasons, withdrawals and attempts to keep up with benchmarks.\n\nMove the needle\n\nBuffett has lots of cash. To move the needle, he needs to buy massive quantities of a large-cap stock such as Apple. Most investors do not have the problem of \"too much cash\" as Buffett does.\n\nApple bull\n\nRelax, Apple fans, I am an Apple bull. During Apple's rise, I have had some of the highest targets for Apple and I have been repeatedly proven right. When we bought Apple at $18.73, I was talking about the scenario of Apple going to $143. This call was made long before Apple became a popular stock. Many called it outrageous; some even canceled their subscriptions to The Arora Report.\n\nLast year I wrote, \"Apple's stock could double on the 'mother of all artificial-intelligence projects.'\" At that time nobody was talking about such a bullish scenario.\n\nApple coming close to $200 is now a reality. Well in advance, last year I wrote, \"These three catalysts will push Apple's stock to over $200.\"\n\nWhat to do now\n\nAt The Arora Report we recognize that all investors are different. For this reason we provide several ways to invest including the \"good way\" and the \"best way.\" In the \"good way,\" our buy now rating on Apple is a \"yes.\" However, our methodology calls for buying very little and scaling in on dips. For the \"best way,\" our methodology calls for waiting patiently for a dip into the buy zone. Further, we have doubled long-term returns by trading around a long-term core position with shorter-term positions.\n\nThose already holding Apple stock may consider continuing to hold. Here is an example of how accurate my calls on catching Apples dips have been based on the six screens of the ZYX Change Method. Please see \"This is (probably) how low Apple's stock will go.\" This column was written at a time when there was a lot of negativity about Apple and many gurus were predicting Apple to go much lower. At the time of the call, Apple was trading at $164. The call was that Apple could fall to $148 and that would be a buying opportunity. Well, Apple fell to $149.13 and rebounded. The reason I am mentioning this is to show Apple stock bulls that even bulls ought to consider various factors and not blindly follow Buffett unless you have resources and time frames like Buffett does.\n\nDisclosure: Subscribers to The Arora Report may have positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

                "body": "It's D-Day for oil as investors wait for POTUS to lay down his Iran proclamation, and investors keep selling the slick stuff in anticipation.\n\nWhile crude is going to dominate the day, there's another asset worth keeping a weather eye on. Just a couple of weeks ago, the yield on 10-year Treasurys TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.22% ratcheted up to 3%. It's since backed off that level, but investors remain a little edgy about the possible inversion of the yield curve, when short-dated yields crest above long-dated ones -- seen as a recession red flag.\n\nSo brace yourself for our call of the day, from none other than J.P. Morgan's chief executive Jamie Dimon, who says get ready for 10-year note yields to hit 4%.\n\nIf economic growth picks up, and inflation accelerates and goes higher than expected, that could prompt the Federal Reserve to push up interest rates faster than seen so far, he cautions in an interview with Bloomberg TV.\n\n\"That could force the 10-year up, not down as in the in the past. You can easily deal with 4% bonds, and I think people should be prepared for that,\" Dimon says.\n\nBut before you batten down the hatches, the J.P. Morgan CEO adds that if 4% is the mark of a \"strong and healthy\" America, then he would call yields' push higher \"almost normalization.\"\n\nDimon spent a good chunk of time in the interview talking about how great America is looking -- with a strong economy, a wide-open capital markets and a financial system in decent shape. Though he is a little worried about government borrowing and the chance other countries might start bailing on U.S. bonds.\n\n\"That may cause may cause more volatility, higher rates in a way we don't fully understand,\" given that the world has never been through quantitative easing before, nor its reversal, he says.\n\nMakes you wonder what Warren Buffett makes of Dimon's 4% call. The Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B, +0.73% BRK.B, +0.73% boss told shareholders this weekend that long-term bonds are a \"terrible investment\" anywhere near current yields.\n\nThe market\n\nOil's losses are spilling over this morning, and Dow YMM8, -0.23% , S&P ESM8, -0.28% and Nasdaq NQM8, -0.34% futures are in the red. On Monday, the Dow DJIA, +0.39% , S&P SPX, +0.35% and Nasdaq COMP, +0.77% closed up, but off session highs.\n\nCrude CLM8, -0.99% is under $70 a barrel ahead of President Trump's Iran decision, which he says will come at 2 p.m. today. The dollar DXY, +0.35% is rising, while gold GCM8, -0.24% is off. A tech rebound helped lift Asia stocks, while Europe stocks SXXP, -0.22% SXXP, -0.22% have lost hold of a 3-month high.\n\nRead: Here's what sanctions on Iran could do to global oil supply and prices\n\nRead Market Snapshot for more.\n\nThe chart\n\nEverything you ever wanted to know about the Iran nuclear agreement, from 2013 onward. Compliments of Barclays, which wrote a special report on \"Trump and the Art of (breaking the Iran) Deal.\"\n\nWhatever Trump decides today, as Barclays points out, \"his foreign policy continues to ignite tensions in the main oil-exporting center and is, thus, price supportive.\"\n\nThe buzz\n\nValeant Pharmaceuticals VRX, +0.78% is soaring after results. To shake off its past, the company is changing its name to Bausch Health Cos., and its ticker to BHC.\n\nCrocs CROX, -1.81% Dean Foods DF, -0.71% also reported, with Potbelly PBPB, -1.21% en route. Disney DIS, +1.31% , Tripadvisor TRIP, +2.34% and Godaddy GDDY, +0.68% earnings are expected after the close.

Musk also apparently has a new gal pal.\n\nApple AAPL, +0.72% may be worth watching after shares closed at a record on Monday, having rallied at the fastest pace in nine years.\n\nChinese exports bounced back in April, widening that contentious U.S.-China trade gap even further.\n\nOn the politics beat, Trump lawyers say they'll decide by May 17 whether POTUS will talk to special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThere's not much on the top-tier data front -- the small-business confidence index and job openings.

                "body": "With 'Avengers: Infinity War' already atop $1 billion and an 'Ant-Man' sequel on the way, Marvel heads for blockbuster year\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. earnings report will be a Wakanda-sized celebration, but the excitement is already being overshadowed by a giant, purple god that could be even bigger.\n\nWhen Disney DIS, +1.31% reports second-quarter earnings after the bell Tuesday, the success of Marvel's \"Black Panther\" will be a huge focus, as the blockbuster film opened about halfway through the quarter and added hundreds of millions to Disney's movie revenue and profit. The first Marvel movie with an African-American lead has become one of the top 10 box-office successes of all time, and is No. 3 for domestic returns, behind only \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" and \"Avatar.\"\n\nIt appears \"Black Panther\" will not stay in its current spots on the all-time lists for long, however, as purple-hued Marvel villain Thanos takes center stage. Marvel's \"Avengers: Infinity War\" has become the fastest movie to surpass $1 billion in box-office returns, taking less than two weeks to hit that number, and early returns made Marvel the fastest studio to hit $1 billion in box office in a year in history, according to Forbes. There is still another Marvel movie scheduled to premiere this year as well, \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" in July.\n\nRead: Why 'Black Panther' is the most important blockbuster in years\n\nThe success is helping to push expectations for Disney's studio business higher, as the company continues to profit from its acquisitions of Marvel, \"Star Wars\" studio Lucasfilm and Pixar. Analysts have added about $100 million to their quarterly forecasts for that segment of Disney's business since \"Black Panther\" came out in February, pushing the total to $2.19 billion.\n\n\"This demonstrates Disney's continued ability to create leading franchises through quality [intellectual property] and excellent execution.\" Macquarie analysts wrote in an earnings preview in which they pushed their theatrical revenue estimate to $888 million from $817 million.\n\nThe Macquarie analysts believe that Black Panther realized about $376 million in profit in the quarter, based on an estimate of $300 million in production and marketing costs. Disney is expected to report operating profit of $3.75 billion for the quarter, according to FactSet, which would make \"Black Panther\" worth about 10% of Disney's total.\n\nSee also: The 10 years and 17 films that led Marvel to 'Black Panther'\n\nAnalysts have also added to Disney's expected earnings thanks to Marvel's success. While the average expectations have moved higher by just a penny a share since the end of February, UBS analysts added 10 cents to their second-quarter estimate, which was due to the outperformance of \"Black Panther.\" UBS has a buy rating and $128 price target on the stock.\n\nAny reticence to push estimates higher could be stemming from disappointment elsewhere, namely from Disney's other main movie opening of the quarter. \"A Wrinkle in Time\" opened to a disappointing $33.1 million (playing second fiddle on its first weekend to \"Black Panther,\" which was already in its fourth), stressed Daniel Salmon of BMO Capital Markets, who has a Market Perform rating and $100 price target on the stock.\n\nDisney will also premiere a new \"Star Wars\" movie this quarter, with \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" premiering on May 25, and Pixar's \"The Incredibles 2\" scheduled to launch on June 15.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nEarnings: Analysts on average expect Disney to report earnings of $1.70 a share, according to FactSet, up from $1.50 a share a year ago. Contributors at Estimize, which crowdsources estimates from analysts, fund managers and academics, expect profit of $1.73 a share on average.\n\nRevenue: Analysts expect total revenue of $14.1 billion on average, FactSet reports, up from $13.3 billion a year ago. Estimize contributors on average predict sales of $14.3 billion.\n\nDisney revenue has historically broken down into four segments (more on that below), which the company calls Media Networks, Parks & Resorts, Studio Entertainment and Consumer Products & Interactive. On average, analysts expect sales of $6.09 billion for media networks, with $4.22 billion coming from cable networks and $1.86 billion from broadcast; $4.69 billion from Parks & Resorts; $2.19 billion for Studio Entertainment; and $1.14 billion for Consumer Products & Interactive.\n\nStock movement: Disney stock has fallen after three of the past four quarterly earnings reports, and shares are down 4.7% so far in 2018 and 8.5% in the past 12 months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.39% , which counts Disney as a component, is down 1.9% this year and up 15.8% in the past 12 months.\n\nWhat analysts are saying\n\nAnalysts are excited to hear about ESPN, a big focus of investors for the past couple of years as the sports family of cable networks has been losing subscribers who are cutting the cable cord. With this update, Disney's overall streaming strategy could also be discussed. Disney launched a new direct-to-consumer ESPN service late in its fiscal second quarter, part of a strategy that will also eventually include a Disney streaming-media service expected to launch after the company's contract with Netflix Inc. NFLX, +1.93% ends.\n\nOpinion: The ESPN streaming service is not new, Disney just wants you to pay for it\n\nAs part of this new strategy, Disney will reorganize its historical segments to produce a new division focused on direct-to-consumer and international offerings, replacing the Consumer Products & Interactive segment, which will be split up and absorbed mostly in Parks & Resorts. Disney expects to start reporting the new segments by the beginning of its next fiscal year.\n\nWhile the reorganization will not be in place for Tuesday's report, expect Disney to offer a lot of color on the segment in the wake of the ESPN+ launch, as analysts and investors have lots of questions and expectations.\n\n\"We feel that Disney's broader shift to DTC/OTT is correctly the top point of investor focus right now,\" BMO analysts wrote in a note on April 25, in which they bumped Disney's rating to market perform from underperform.\n\nDon't miss: Netflix sees sharks approaching from both sides in Apple and Disney\n\n\"Strategizing around Disney's overall OTT strategy beyond just ESPN+ is becoming increasingly important given the growing proportion of Disney viewership that is happening on alternative distribution platforms,\" wrote Macquarie analysts, who have an outperform rating on the shares with a $125 price target.\n\nThe effort is likely to have a negative effect in the short-term, as Disney spends to build the services, but is expected to begin showing fruit in a couple of years.\n\n\"Overall, we expect the Disney-branded service to be a powerful consumer offering that enhances the Disney ecosystem and brand, but notable content investments and lost licensing fees over the next couple of years are likely to drive losses before the service ramps to roughly break-even by F2021 with ~13m subscribers,\" JP Morgan analysts wrote in an April 30 note devoted entirely to Disney's streaming plans. \"Meanwhile, we expect ESPN+ to have a very modest financial benefit by F2020, although given the complementary nature of the offering, we do not expect it to be a meaningful financial driver but rather become an important technology and digital infrastructure platform for the company as the media landscape becomes increasingly on-demand.\"\n\nIn its theme parks business, Disney increased admission prices in February, which should lead to discussions of early results and expectations for long-term effects. Consumer products is expected to get a boost from branded tie-ins with the Marvel movies and other properties.\n\nSee also: How to take your kids to Disney World for free (almost)\n\nAcquisitions will also be a big topic, as Disney's $52.4 billion bid for parts of 21st Century Fox FOX, +0.86% is becoming even more complicated. Comcast Corp. CMCSA, +1.35% topped Fox's bid for Sky PLC SKY, +0.48% after bidding more for the Fox assets than Disney but losing out on regulatory concerns, and Comcast is reportedly considering making another play for the assets Disney is in line to receive. That situation may have gotten even more complicated after a report Monday evening suggested Comcast may be prepping for another attempt at the Fox assets Disney has agreed to acquire, so expect plenty of questions Tuesday in Disney's conference call.\n\nOf 25 analysts tracked by FactSet, 15 have the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock, and 10 have a hold rating, with none suggesting the stock is a sell. The average price target is $121.89, suggesting an 18.9% premium to Monday's closing price.",

                "body": "Streaming platform revenue is expected to surpass hardware sales for the first time\n\nRoku Inc. executives have been adamant that the company's streaming platform is the future of the business, and that future appears to be here.\n\nAfter the bell Wednesday, Roku ROKU, +5.13% is expected to report that the company's streaming platform outperformed its hardware in a quarter for the first time, highlighting the investment thesis that executives sold in the company's initial public offering. Analysts expect hardware sales of $60.3 million and platform revenue of $66.7 million -- nearly double what the company reported for platform-related sales in the year-earlier quarter.\n\nPlatform revenue includes advertising revenue, content and licensing deals, with ads accounting for more than two-thirds of the segment, while hardware includes Roku's line of dongles, set-top boxes and other streaming gadgets. The reason platform is the company's focus is obvious: margins are much fatter. Analysts model platform gross margin of $49 million, compared with $6.3 million for hardware.\n\nMargins for the ad business the best when the company is selling video ads, Chief Financial Officer Steve Louden has said in the past. But Louden said that he liked all of the company's ad inventory because the company sold it at high margins across the board, though some margins were \"extremely high.\"\n\nThe company's hardware margins were tighter during the holiday quarter because of memory shortages in China, which forced the company to airlift product to the U.S. to ensure delivery, Chief Executive Anthony Wood told MarketWatch after the last quarter's earnings.\n\nExecutives have said on several occasions that they work to optimize hardware pricing against volume -- lower prices often result increased unit sales. While Roku has said it expects to continue to generate gross hardware profit, deep discounts continue to be a part of the company's moneymaking customer acquisition strategy.\n\nHere is what to expect\n\nEarnings: On average, analysts polled by FactSet project expect adjusted losses of 13 cents a share and GAAP losses of 16 cents a share. Contributors to Estimize, which crowdsources estimates from analysts, fund managers and academics, predict losses of 11 cents a share.\n\nRevenue: For the first quarter, analysts estimate sales of $127.5 million. Analysts expect Roku to add 5.7 million new users. Estimize contributors expect sales of $128.3 million.\n\nStock movement: Roku stock has fallen 27% in the past three months as the benchmark S&P 500 index SPX, +0.35% has fallen nearly 1%. Roku shares began trading Sept. 28 and have gained 25% since, as the S&P has gained 5%.\n\nOf the nine sell-side analysts that cover Roku, three rate the company a buy, five have a hold on the name and one rates it a sell. The average price target is $37.86, which represents an average upside of 14% from Monday's close.\n\nWhat else to look for\n\nKeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Evan Wingren wrote in a note to clients Monday that investors should keep an eye on the Roku Channel, an ad-supported free station available on the company's TV operating system. Wingren said that at the moment it is in its infancy, the channel has the potential to capture a \"growing portion of library content\" and is one of the \"few scaled streaming applications.\"\n\nRoku's licensing program, which it bundles into the platform revenue segment, also puts the company in a unique position versus competitors such as Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.21% Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +0.80% GOOG, +0.63% and Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.72% because its software is built into televisions. Licensing the company's tech also positions it to acquire new users via TV purchases, wrote Wingren.\n\nDon't miss: The man who gave us the DVR says Roku is the future of TV\n\n\"New OEMs will increase the number of [TV models]containing Roku TVs, which would likely translate into increasing adoption by consumers and further cement Roku's leadership in TV operating systems,\" Wingren wrote. \"To the extent that Roku branded TVs continue to gain share, it would place incremental pressure on the market share of OEM non-licensees like LG and Vizio to potentially integrate the Roku OS into SKUs of their TV offerings.\"\n\nIn the long run, Wingren wrote that Roku is in a position to take advantage of the slow shift in video consumption from traditional TV and cable to the internet, even though online viewing isn't typically ad-supported.",

Technology stocks were among the strongest of the day, with the sector up 0.8%. Among notable names, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.12% rose 1.1% and Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.71% was up 0.7%. Energy stocks rose 0.2%, ending well below an early rally that took the industry up more than 2%.

                "title": "Apple's share buyback is a smarter use of its cash than these 4 other options",
                "body": "When Apple announced that it would repurchase $100 billion worth of its stock, investors cheered and pundits jeered. An economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, who reportedly studies stock buybacks proclaimed that \"it's nothing but a manipulation of the stock market.\"\n\nHogwash. It is almost impossible to manipulate -- in any meaningful sense of the word -- stocks that are as heavily traded as Apple AAPL, +1.19% and Apple's buyback is nothing more than a sensible way of distributing part of the company's earnings to Apple's owners, its shareholders.\n\nApple's stock price did increase after the buyback was announced but it wasn't because of some nefarious market manipulation. Investors liked Apple's second-quarter results; investors loved Warren Buffett's announcement that Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, +1.21% BRK.B, +0.89% had purchased 75 million shares of Apple before the buyback was announced; and investors liked the fact that Apple was doing something smart with its cash.\n\nIf we want to think seriously about buybacks, instead of chanting political slogans and smears, let's consider what Apple might plausibly do with $100 billion in cash.\n\nHold on to it\n\nThere is a substantial opportunity cost to holding on to cash, or investing it in Treasury bills paying a modest interest rate. If Apple's shareholders can earn a 10% return on their investments and Apple has $100 billion invested in Treasury bills paying 2%, the opportunity cost is 8%, or $8 billion a year. The economic value added is negative $8 billion a year, which means Apple is destroying value instead of creating value.\n\nIt is better to deploy cash than to hoard it.\n\nPay off debt\n\nApple has more than $100 billion in debt, so it could the $100 billion of cash to pay off some of its borrowings. Although it superficially seems imprudent, U.S. tax laws reward companies that have (modest amounts of) debt. As with other corporations, Apple's debt is a tax shield because, unlike dividends, the interest Apple pays on its debt is tax-deductible. A company pays less in taxes if it is financed partly by debt instead of entirely by equity. The less that is paid in taxes, the more cash is available for bondholders and stockholders.\n\nAdmittedly, debt isn't a blessing if a firm goes bankrupt and lawyers charging $1,000 an hour have to sort out the mess, but Apple's debt is conservative and it increases its free cash flow.\n\nFund expansion\n\nApple could use its cash to hire more people, but hiring people for the sake of hiring people is a pretty bad business plan. Corporations are owned by their shareholders and should act in their best interests. Hiring more people and growing the firm only benefits shareholders if the company can earn a return on its investment that is greater than the return that the firm's shareholders can earn on their own. Otherwise, the firm is throwing away its shareholders' money, destroying value instead of adding value.\n\nWhen Apple does find attractive opportunities to add value in the future, it won't have to worry about how to pay for them. Apple is a money machine that generates plenty of cash.\n\nPay dividends\n\nIf a company has more cash than it needs for new investments, it should give the cash to its shareholders -- either through dividends or share repurchases -- and let them do better. Apple, like most companies, pays dividends. However, shareholders have to pay taxes on their dividends, which bring us to buybacks, a better way to give cash to stockholders.\n\nRepurchase shares\n\nFor firms that want to disburse some of their profits to shareholders, share repurchases can be better than dividends -- and that is how we should think of stock buybacks, as a disguised dividend.\n\nInstead of giving $100 billion to shareholders and calling it a dividend, Apple is giving $100 billion to shareholders and calling it a buyback. Either way, the value of Apple after it gives $100 billion to its shareholders is exactly the same -- the same assets, the same products, the same customers whether it is a dividend or a buyback -- so the aggregate value of its stock should be the same, too. The only real difference is that the taxes shareholders have to pay on the $100 billion they receive depends on whether it is called a dividend or a buyback.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation about buybacks. Legendary fund manager Peter Lynch once argued that \"if a company buys back half its shares and its overall earnings stay the same, the earnings per share have just doubled.\" The obvious flaw is that the firm may have to liquidate half its assets to buy back half its stock. How can earnings stay the same if the firm sheds half its assets?\n\nA New York Times columnist made a similarly misleading argument about Apple's buyback when he wrote that buybacks \"reliably lift stock prices by limiting the supply of shares for sale.\" Not true. The intrinsic value of a company's stock depend on how profitable a company is, not the supply of shares; so the real question is how buybacks affect a company's profits. If a firm liquidates half its assets in order to cut the supply of shares in half, then its assets per share are unchanged and there is no reason for the reduced supply of shares to increase the value of each share.\n\nThe real value of a buyback comes from the disbursement of idle cash, not from a change in the number of shares.\n\nRead: Warren Buffett applauds Apple's share buybacks\n\nLet's ignore taxes for a moment and work through a simple example. A company has 20 million shares outstanding, each valued at $20 (an aggregate market value of $400 million). This firm has $20 million in cash to distribute to its shareholders. One alternative is to pay a $1 dividend per share; another is to buy back 1 million shares at $20 apiece. This table shows the consequences. Either way, the $20 million payout reduces the firm's aggregate value from $400 million to $380 million.\n\nInitial position After $1 dividend After repurchasing 1 million shares Shares (in millions) 20 20 19 Price per share $20 $19 $20 Firm's total value (in millions) $400 $380 $380\n\nIf the firm pays a $1 dividend, each share is worth $1 less, since $380 million divided among 20 million shares is $19. The shareholders are no better or worse off since they started with $400 million in stock and now they have $20 million in cash and $380 million in stock.\n\nIf, instead, the firm repurchases shares, the number of shares declines by 1 million, and $380 million aggregate value divided among 19 million shares makes each share worth $20. No one is better or worse off. Those who sell their shares get $20 in cash for their stock; those who don't sell continue to have stock worth $20 a share.\n\nDividends and buybacks are alternative ways of giving a firm's shareholders some of the profits that the firm earns on their behalf. The crucial difference between dividends and buybacks is the tax consequences for shareholders, and this gives buybacks a clear advantage over dividends.\n\nWhen a company pays dividends, all shareholders pay taxes, and they pay taxes on all the cash they receive. When a company repurchases stock, shareholders don't have to sell, and those who do sell only pay taxes on their capital gains. That may not be all of them. Some may have no capital gains and pay no taxes; others may have tax losses and receive a tax credit. The bottom line is that with buybacks, shareholders have a choice: to sell or not. Those who do sell don't have to pay as much in taxes as they would if the firm had disbursed the cash as dividends. Win-win.\n\nThe conclusion is simple and has nothing to do with market manipulation. Except for the benefits from avoiding taxes on dividends, a stock buyback is equivalent to paying dividends -- a dividend in disguise. If you like dividends, you will love repurchases.\n\nApple did its shareholders a huge favor when it reduced their tax obligations by making part of its cash distribution a buyback instead of dividends.\n\nGary Smith is the Fletcher Jones Professor of Economics at Pomona College and author of \"Money Machine: The Surprisingly Simple Power of Value Investing.\"",

                "body": "Another $15 rally in the stock price would make Apple the first trillion-dollar company\n\nApple Inc.'s stock is running higher at the fastest pace in over nine years, as investors continue to reap the rewards of better-than-expected earnings and an endorsement from famed value investor Warren Buffett.\n\nThe stock AAPL, +1.30% shot up $1.93, or 1.1%, to $185.76 in midday trade Monday, to climb above Friday's all-time intraday high of $184.25, and head toward its sixth straight gain. The stock got a 4.4% lift last Wednesday, after Apple reported fiscal second-quarter profit and revenue that beat expectations, and a further 3.9% boost on Friday, after Buffett said he bought 75 million more Apple shares during the first quarter.\n\nA sixth straight gain would be the longest win streak since the six-session streak ended Sept. 1, 2017. The stock has soared 14.4% during the current streak, which would mark the biggest six-session gain since it rocketed 14.5% during the six days ended March 18, 2009, as the stock extended its bounce off bear market lows.\n\nApple shares have climbed 9.8% year to date, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index NDX, +0.92% has advanced 6.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.70% of which Apple is a component, has slipped 1.2%.\n\nWith 4.915 billion shares outstanding as of April 20, according to the latest quarterly filing, Apple is currently the most valuable U.S. company with a market capitalization of $913.04 billion.\n\nDon't miss: Opinion: Ranking Amazon, Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft in the race to $1 trillion in market value.\n\nFor Apple to reach the much-anticipated $1 trillion valuation goal, the stock would have to close above $203.45, which is $17.69, or 9.5%, above current levels.\n\nOthers in line for the trillion-dollar mark are second-place Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.14% at $775.95 billion, according to FactSet, followed by Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.45% at $741.04 billion and Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +0.94% at $737.02 billion.",

                "body": "Short-Seller Mark Spiegel: Die Tesla-Aktie hat einen Wert von Null\n\nThe Investor Movement Indexdeclined for a fourth consecutive month in April 2018, slipping 8 percent from the prior month to 4.79, TD Ameritrade, Inc. announced today. The Investor Movement Index, or the IMX, is a proprietary, behavior-based index created by TD Ameritrade that aggregates Main Street investor positions and activity to measure what investors actually were doing and how they were positioned in the markets.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180507005475/en/\n\nApril IMX\n\nThe April 2018 Investor Movement Index for the four weeks ended April 27, 2018 reveals:\n\nAs U.S. markets continued to experience elevated volatility relative to what has been experienced in recent years, TD Ameritrade clients lowered their overall exposure to equity markets, causing the IMX to drop in April. However, they still showed interest in a few specific names, including Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN).\n\n\"Clients seemed to use the continued climb in oil prices to the 70 dollar level as an opportunity to rotate out of oil names, such as Transocean Ltd. and National Oilwell Varco, Inc., while the millennial population chose not to reduce exposure to energy stocks this month,\" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.\n\nTD Ameritrade clients were net buyers of some volatile names during the April IMX period, including:\n\nDespite being net buyers, TD Ameritrade clients found equities to sell during the period, including:\n\nMarkets continued to be volatile at the start of the April period as attention shifted from geopolitical tensions to earnings season. While elevated volatility carried over from March into April, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) retreated to monthly lows as the S&P 500 broke through what had previously been a major upside resistance level. This quickly changed as the yield on the key 10-year Treasury note was finally able to establish itself above the 3 percent level. As a result of this and tepid forecasts from CEOs, markets quickly fell lower and the VIX increased once again.\n\n\"Investors will likely continue to monitor corporate earnings, likely paying close attention to CEO comments, in addition to economic data pointing to inflationary pressures building in the economy for the remainder of May,\" said Kinahan.\n\nAbout the IMX\n\nThe IMX value is calculated based on a complex proprietary formula. Each month, TD Ameritrade pulls a sample from its client base of more than 11 million funded accounts, which includes all accounts that completed a trade in the past month. The holdings and positions of this statistically significant sample are evaluated to calculate individual scores, and the median of those scores represents the monthly IMX.\n\nFor more information on the Investor Movement Index, including historical IMX data going back to January 2010; to view the full report from April 2018; or to sign up for future IMX news alerts, please visit www.tdameritrade.com/IMX. Additionally, TD Ameritrade clients can chart the IMX using the symbol $IMX in either the thinkorswim or TD Ameritrade Mobile Trader platforms.\n\nInclusion of specific security names in this commentary does not constitute a recommendation from TD Ameritrade to buy, sell, or hold.\n\nPast performance of a security, strategy, or index is no guarantee of future results or investment success.\n\nHistorical data should not be used alone when making investment decisions. Please consult other sources of information and consider your individual financial position and goals before making an independent investment decision.\n\nThe IMX is not a tradable index.

AAPL, +1.37% surged 1.4% in morning trade Monday, and have hit a record intraday high for the second-straight session as they look to stretch their winning streak to six sessions.

It has also rocketed 14.9% during the past six sessions, which would be the biggest six-day gain since it rose 20.0% over the six sessions ending March 17, 2009. The stock has rallied 10.2% year to date, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 NDX, +0.93% has climbed 6.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.72% has slipped 1.4%.",

Meanwhile, crude-oil prices CLM8, +0.95% climbed above $70 a barrel early in the session, their highest level since 2014. With crude futures rising, investors were likely to keep a close eye on comments linked to the Iran nuclear deal. Separately, shares of Athenahealth Inc.

                "body": "The triple-digit swings might make it feel otherwise, but the stock market, despite its spiking volatility VIX, -7.11% has been mired in a trading range. Nothing like it was during the historic doldrums last year, of course, but rangebound nonetheless.\n\nIn fact, we're pretty much right where we started the year.\n\nWhat will it take to change that? A stellar earnings season and some of that tasty fiscal stimulus haven't been enough for a break to higher highs. And all the unsettling news -- geopolitical tensions, rising commodity prices, tariff talk, whipsaw corrections -- haven't been enough to keep the S&P SPX, +1.28% firmly in the red, either. The struggle is real.\n\nBut, ultimately, stocks will commit to a direction. Bank of America's BAC, +0.34% Michael Hartnett, in a note highlighted on Zero Hedge over the weekend, laid out some potential catalysts and how investors might best play a market that's currently stuck between peaking profits and Fed tightening.\n\nA steady assault on new highs, he says, would likely be realized if the Federal Reserve backs away from its rate hikes and Team Trump lays off the protectionism. Buybacks may also provide a tailwind for stocks, as could a refreshed appetite for the tech high-flyers amid surging earnings and tax cuts.\n\nHartnett, however, says the bearish case is more likely, and that could be triggered by weaker GDP, slowing Chinese export growth and more geopolitical flare-ups. Toss in credit contagion and \"policy impotence\" and a break lower would be unavoidable.\n\nIn our call of the day, here are some of the moves he suggest investors consider to protect themselves in the face of such a selloff:\n\nLong T-Bills ... as the Fed now sole hawkish central bank.\n\nLong China stocks SHCOMP, +1.48% ... on China policy easing & credibility.\n\nLong U.S. Dollar DXY, +0.28% ...on stealth easing by global central banks.\n\nShort EM local currency-denominated debt ... on peak positioning & reducing EM FX exposure, a traditional vehicle to reduce portfolio beta.\n\nShort FAANG ... tricky as tech bubble risk remains high, but crowded & 2018 consensus too strongly believes weaker global EPS will not hurt FAANG.\n\nShort High Yield bonds ... we think the best hedge against policy impotence.\n\nIt's still early, but that bearish scenario isn't exactly unfolding today...\n\nThe market\n\nFutures on the Dow YMM8, +0.35% , S&P ESM8, +0.37% and Nasdaq NQM8, +0.62% are all nudging higher premarket, as are both gold GCM8, -0.12% and crude CLM8, +0.93% , which topped $70 a barrel -- the first time since 2014. Asia ADOW, +0.21% markets closed with gains for the most part, while Europe SXXP, +0.24% , on a bank holiday in the U.K., was holding mostly steady.\n\nRead Market Snapshot for more\n\nThe chart\n\nStocks have been volatile of late, but the steady decline that many had predicted would befall the market once quantitate tightening began hasn't really taken hold, as you can see by this chart from Callum Thomas of the Topdown Charts blog:\n\nBut how long will investors hang on?\n\n\"If you thought quantitative easing was a tailwind for stocks on the way up it stands to reason that it will be a headwind on the way down,\" Thomas wrote. \"So this will be one to watch and a risk to be mindful of.\"\n\nThe buzz\n\nPrepare for a buffet of all things Buffett today after the festivities in Omaha will give way to the Berkshire Hathway BRK.A, +1.93% CEO's appearances on the media circuit on Monday. Over the weekend, Buffett gave investors plenty to chew on as he touched on everything from Microsoft MSFT, +1.16% to bitcoin BTCUSD, -2.50% to Apple AAPL, +3.92% and more.\n\nWith 81% of companies having reported earnings already, the season is winding down. Among the S&P 500 companies, 47 will report earnings next week, including Nvidia NVDA, +2.61% , COST, +1.13% and Walt Disney Co. DIS, +2.42%\n\nDeal news is trotting out this morning. Starbucks SBUX, +2.76% is getting a lift after Nestle said it will market the coffee maker's products globally and get $7.15 billion as part of the agreement.\n\nInternational Flavors & Fragrances IFF, +1.48% says it will buy Israel-based Frutarom FRUT, +0.00% in a $7.1 billion deal, and that's taking a toll on IFF shares this morning.\n\nGramercy Property GPT, +0.42% is soaring after news Blackstone will buy it in a cash deal worth $7.6 billion.\n\nKeep an eye on Hawaii's Kilauea volcano after it spent the weekend erupting and causing the evacuation of thousands of people. As of Sunday, dozens of homes have been destroyed. Check out some of the footage:\n\nNew video shows lava sputtering from a fissure on Hawaii's Big Island, where the K\u012blauea volcano continues to erupt pic.twitter.com/CKbf7nxhCg -- BNO News (@BNONews)\n\nMay 6, 2018\n\nThe quote\n\n\"I'm going to build a moat & fill it w candy. Warren B will not be able to resist investing! Berkshire Hathaway kryptonite... I'm super super serious\" -- Elon Musk, trolling Warren Buffett on Twitter over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, the Onion is reporting on another of Musk's visions:\n\nFetid, Shit-Covered Elon Musk Announces Plan To Revolutionize Nation's Sewage System https://t.co/CUQjSPu4Tj pic.twitter.com/utlSUEkOON -- The Onion (@TheOnion)\n\nMay 6, 2018\n\nThe economy\n\nNot much on the schedule this week in terms of economic data, though we will get a look at the Consumer Price Index on Thursday. As for today, the Federal Reserve will release the consumer credit figure at 3 p.m. Eastern, with the consensus calling for an increase of $16 billion in March.\n\nA few Fed speakers are on tap today, including Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will be speaking at a panel discussion in Zurich, Switzerland.\n\nRead: Is worker pay inflated? No, but other things are pushing prices up and keeping the Fed on guard.\n\nThe stat\n\n$1.2 billion -- That's the record-breaking total haul for Walt Disney's \"Avengers: Infinity War.\" The film just became the first ever to top $1 billion in 11 days.

                "body": "U.S. stock futures moved higher on Monday, building on jobs report-inspired gains as a sharp climb for oil prices and the dollar were in focus and a trio of Federal Reserve speakers was upcoming.\n\nGains were supported by a couple of deals, including one driving up the price of Starbucks Corp.\n\nHow are the main benchmarks performing?\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average YMM8, +0.21% futures rose 45 points, or 0.2%, to 24,273, while S&P 500 futures ESM8, +0.28% rose 6.4 points, or 0.2%, to 2,669.50. Nasdaq-100 futures NQM8, +0.56% gained 33.5 points, or 0.5%, to 6,808.50.\n\nOn Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.39% rose 332.36 points, or 1.4%, to end at 24,262.51, after an earlier drop of about 150 points. The blue-chip average logged its biggest daily climb since April 10, according to FactSet data. However, the average has struggled lately, falling in nine of the past 13 sessions.\n\nThe S&P 500 index SPX, +1.28% rose 33.69 points, or 1.3%, to finish at 2,663.42. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.71% rose 121.47 points, or 1.7%. The Dow and S&P each slipped 0.2% last week, and the Nasdaq rose 1.3%.\n\nWhat's driving markets?\n\nInvestors may continue to push markets higher after Friday's upbeat April jobs report. The only data of note for Monday is consumer credit for March, due at 3 p.m. Eastern Time, in a week that includes closely watched consumer prices.\n\nGeopolitical topics will also be in focus. As oil prices climbed above $70 a barrel on Monday, investors were likely to keep a close eye on comments linked to the Iran nuclear deal. U.S. President Donald Trump must decide by next weekend, May 12, whether to abandon the deal. Such a move would trigger a reimposition of economic sanctions on Iran, hampering oil exports from the country and cutting global supply.\n\nGlobal trade headlines will also be in focus for investors, after a team of U.S. negotiators appeared to garner no deal out of talks with counterparts in Beijing. China state media indicated that talks were positive, and more talks will be needed to avoid a trade war, the South China Morning Post reported.\n\nRead: After earnings barrage and data, stock-market moves now hinge on global trade\n\nA trio of Fed members are slated to speak on Monday, which could give further clues to the direction of interest rates. Richmond Federal President Tom Barkin is scheduled to speak at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., at 2 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nChicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan will both speak at the 23rd Annual Financial Markets Conference in Amelia Island, Fla., at 3:30 p.m. Eastern.\n\nWhat are strategists saying?\n\n\"It seems that the possible re-escalation of geopolitical risks between U.S. and Iran doesn't affect market participants' bias at this time. However, this notion will be put to the test as we draw closer to the deciding May 12 date when Trump has to recertify the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) deal so we believe that investors should keep their guard up for the rest of the week,\" said Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADS Securities, in a note to clients.\n\nWhich stocks are in focus?\n\nTyson Foods Inc. TSN, +1.39% and Sempra Energy SRE, +0.35% are among a handful of companies that will report earnings ahead of the open. After the close, Zillow Group Inc. ZG, +2.97% and Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. HTZ, +4.35% will report.\n\nStarbucks Corp. SBUX, +2.76% rose nearly 3% in thin premarket trading after Nestl\u00e9 SA NSRGY, +0.33% NESN, +1.02% said it has reached a deal to market the coffee chain's consumer and food service products. Starbucks will receive a $7.15 billion up-front payment as part of the deal. Nestl\u00e9 shares rose 0.8% in Zurich.\n\nShares of International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. IFF, +1.48% fell over 6% after announcing a $7.1 billion stock-and-cash deal to acquire Israel-based Frutarom Industries, Ltd. FRUT, +0.00% .\n\nShares of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.A, +1.93% BRK.B, +2.10% could be active after the multinational conglomerate said over the weekend it swung to a rare loss in the first quarter due to lower insurance premiums and an accounting rule change.\n\nAt the Berkshire shareholder meeting on Saturday, chairman Warren Buffett commented on a range of topics. He applauded Apple Inc.'s AAPL, +3.92% share buybacks, defended a stake in Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +1.69% and explained why he doesn't invest in Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.16% shares. He said bonds are a 'terrible investment' near current yields and cryptocurrencies \"will come to bad endings.\"\n\nPlus: Buffett on why Berkshire invests in gun stocks\n\nAnd: Buffett says health partnership will have CEO in a 'couple months'\n\nWhat are other markets doing?\n\nEuropean stocks SXXP, +0.19% SXXP, +0.19% climbed, while Asian stocks finished mostly higher.\n\nU.S. oil prices CLM8, +0.98% rose 70 cents, or 1%, to $70.41 a barrel, while the ICE Dollar Index DXY, +0.24% climbed to a four-month high at 92.739 as oil prices surged. Gold prices GCM8, -0.02% were modestly lower at $1,314 an ounce.",

AAPL, +3.92% was asked at the conglomerate's annual meeting why he hasn't also invested in Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.16% Buffett quipped that the answer in regard to Microsoft's early years was his own \"stupidity.\" More seriously, since Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates joined Berkshire's board, and even before, given their friendship, Berkshire has steered clear, he said. Buffett said the reason is the fear that if an acquisition or other news was announced after taking a stake, he \"would be the target of suggestions, or accusations even, that [Gates] had told me something or vice versa.\" Buffett said his stockpickers have also been told to not buy the shares.",

                "title": "6 questions Warren Buffett should face at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting",
                "body": "It's that time of year again, with thousands flocking to Omaha for the opportunity to listen to Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger expound for hours on all things Berkshire Hathaway, in particular, and investing, in general.\n\nRead: This is what the Warren Buffett empire looks like, in one giant chart\n\nWhile the company's BRK.A, +1.65% BRK.B, +1.54% annual meeting is often a bit of a lovefest, Buffett, the Berkshire chairman and chief executive, and Munger, the vice chairman and Buffett's acerbic sidekick, generally don't shy away from tough questions. And there's plenty of fodder for tough queries Saturday when the weekend festivities give way to the annual question-and-answer session beginning at 10:15 a.m. Eastern and running until 4:30 p.m. -- live streamed over Yahoo.\n\nHere are the key topics investors should listen for:\n\nInvestment strategy\n\nBuffett made headlines on the eve of the meeting, telling CNBC that Berkshire bought 75 million shares of Apple Inc. AAPL, +3.73% in the first quarter, adding to the more than 165 million shares it owned at the end of 2017.\n\nSee: Here's how Warren Buffett's stock picks for Berkshire Hathaway have performed in 2018\n\nOpinion: 4 Warren Buffett mistakes that can make you a better investor\n\nBuffett's made no secret of his admiration of the company. But the Apple stake has gone from nonexistent to a core holding in short order, noted Cathy Seifert, equity analyst at CFRA Research, in a phone interview. While Buffett and Munger are typically reticent to tip their hand on investment strategy, they may face questions about whether Berkshire's portfolio, which has been heavily weighted toward financial stocks, is undergoing a shift that could leave it with more of a balance between financials and tech shares, she said.\n\nSuccession\n\nWho will run Berkshire when the 87-year-old Buffett leaves the stage? That's a perennial question he and Berkshire have traditionally sidestepped, saying only that the company's board knows the answer.\n\nBut Buffett earlier this year named Gregory Abel and Ajit Jain, a pair of longtime Berkshire executives, as vice chairmen, in a move widely seen as a hint that one of the two is likely to eventually replace him. Investors might hope that Buffett and Munger will be a bit more forthcoming about those succession plans, though history suggests that might still be unlikely.\n\nBig cash mountain\n\nBuffett was sitting on around $116 billion of dry powder at the end of 2017. What to do with it has also become an issue, with Berkshire largely on the sidelines since its 2016 purchase of Presicsion Castparts for over $30 billion. Buffett, of course, is loath to tip his hand on details of potential acquisitions. In the past, he's expressed frustration about high valuations, writing in his annual letter to shareholders in February about the inability to find companies that could be had at even a \"sensible purchase price.\"\n\nBuffett in February also said he was confident he'd find a way to deploy the cash pile. While Buffett said he would be open to share buybacks, if the stock price fell to his longstanding threshold of 120% of book value, he again dismissed the prospect of dividends.\n\nWells Fargo\n\nThe hits keep coming for Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +2.14% where Berkshire remains the largest shareholder. Buffett often lectures on the importance of integrity, so the scandal-plagued lender's continued woes would appear to be a source of discomfort for Berkshire. But the company, while trimming some holdings to keep its stake below a 10% threshold, has barely budged.\n\nFor his part, Buffett has praised new management but said that new rounds of damaging headlines weren't a surprise. \"What you find is there's never just one cockroach in the kitchen when you start looking around,\" he told CNBC in August.\n\nWith Wells Fargo hit with a $1 billion fine by regulators last month and an unprecedented regulatory action by the Federal Reserve in February, investors might be eager to press Buffett on the issue.\n\nHealth care\n\nBerkshire, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.56% and JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.95% announced in January that they would form a new company aimed at lowering health care costs for employees. Expect investors to look for more details on the venture and Buffett's take on health care costs.\n\nBlockchain\n\nBuffett isn't a bitcoin believer, citing a lack of intrinsic value. But the blockchain technology that underlies bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies does have implications for the insurance business, the beating heart of Berkshire.\n\nIn particular, the distributed ledger is a technology that's very applicable to the relationship between insurance and reinsurance, Seifert said, with the potential to significantly reduce the \"float\" that insurers enjoy.\n\nThe float is money collected from insurance premiums but not yet paid out to meet claims. It's a liability on an insurer's books, but the lag between collecting the premiums and paying out claims provides an opportunity to invest the float -- an opportunity that's been a boon for Berkshire.",

The Dow [ DJIA, +1.12% was up 260 points, or 1.1%, at 24,187, at last check, which would be, if it holds, the sharpest daily return since April 12, when the average climbed 294 points, or 1.2%. The climb comes after a weaker-than-expected jobs report for April showed that 164,000 jobs were created during the month, less than an expected 188,000. However, the labor-market reading may have been read as unlikely to dissuade sway the Federal Reserve's monetary policy plans, pushing it to raise corporate borrowing costs at a more rapid clip than two more rate hikes expected in 2018. The S&P 500 index, meanwhile, was up 1% at 2,654, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.39% rallied by 1.4% at 7,187, with the benchmarks all getting a pop from gains in Apple Inc. AAPL, +3.46% after a late-Thursday report that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bought 75 million shares of the iPhone maker in the first three months of the year, a move that added to bullish sentiment in the market.",

                "title": "We asked musicians why guitar companies like Gibson are struggling and how to revive them",
                "body": "\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\" was a memorable early Radiohead single from 1993. But times have changed, and leading guitar companies are struggling in the 21st century.\n\nThis was illustrated on Wednesday when Gibson Brands Inc, the Nashville-based maker of iconic guitars since 1894 -- instruments that have been played by the likes of Elvis Presley and B.B. King -- filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2016, Gibson's revenue fell from $2.1 billion to $1.7 billion. The bankruptcy petition estimated its debt could be as much as $500 million.\n\nGibson pursued a diversification strategy as a \"music lifestyle\" brand, pivoting unsuccessfully into the home entertainment and audio-equipment industries. The company has announced it will liquidate its consumer-electronics business while restructuring its business to focus on its musical instruments.\n\nGibson is not the solo guitar company that is in peril. The debt of Fender Musical Instruments Corp, another leading guitar company renowned for its Fender Stratocaster guitar, is estimated at $100 million. S&P said in a recent report that there's a risk retail chain Guitar Center \"may not be able to stabilize operating performance and increase profits to meet its debt obligations.\"\n\nGibson's most popular instrument, the Les Paul guitar, has been used by guitarists including Eric Clapton, Slash and Jimmy Page. Yet Clapton himself even speculated at last year's Toronto Film Festival that \"maybe the guitar is over.\"\n\nThe guitar, however, appears to be in better shape than the guitar maker. While in the past decade, sales of the electric guitar have fallen from 1.5 million to 1 million, according to the National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM) a total of 2.6 million guitars, including both acoustic and electric guitars, were sold in the U.S. last year, 300,000 more than in 2009.\n\nGibson filed yesterday to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy code. This does NOT mean Gibson is going out of business. It means it is reorganizing its business to focus on guitars and musical instruments and becoming a stronger company in the process. -- Gibson (@gibsonguitar)\n\nMay 2, 2018\n\n\"Gibson was pressured to get super-rich and they made moves that can destroy companies,\" said Stevie Salas, a guitarist who has recorded with artists ranging from Mick Jagger to Justin Timberlake and was a music director and consultant on \"American Idol.\"\n\n\"They are an iconic American brand but the people who ran the company got greedy and started doing things that weren't what got them there. The problem wasn't people not buying enough guitars; it was the way they were running their business,\" he said.\n\nA spokesperson for Gibson declined to comment.\n\nPeter Hook, the former New Order and Joy Division bassist who is presently touring the US with his band Peter Hook and The Light, told MarketWatch that guitar companies have discovered they aren't too big to fail.\n\n\"You think of the wonderful music that has been made on Gibson guitars -- everybody from The Who to David Bowie,\" he said. \"If you turn on the radio, you'll hear a Gibson guitar within minutes. It's unbelievable that they're going bankrupt.\"\n\n\"But I was recently talking to a guy at Yamaha who told me the total global revenue from musical equipment sales sold round the world doesn't add up to one-thousandth of Apple's AAPL, +3.36% daily turnover. It's a small specialist market,\" Hook said. \"Gibson guitars are expensive and they have been taken over by so many cheap copies. That's what has caused a lot of harm to such a luxury product.\"\n\nPromoted by the likes of Ed Sheeran and Jack Johnson, the acoustic guitar is increasingly becoming more popular at the expense of the electric guitar.\n\n\"The acoustic guitar is something you can travel with easier and make money with easier,\" Salas said. \"When I used to tour with Rod Stewart, we had jets and gigantic trucks but now there's no record-company support so no there's tour support. Record companies aren't offsetting the tour expenses because they can't make their money back in record sales.\"\n\nInstead, he said, \"Ed Sheeran grabs an acoustic guitar like a busker, plugs into a couple of digital boxes and creates his own backdrops to his song. That's the affordable way to tour for today's musicians. You don't need an amplifier and a PA system as you do for an electric guitar.\"\n\n\"People can walk around with the acoustic guitar and play in people's living rooms. I wouldn't be caught dead doing that! Can you imagine Elton John or Rod Stewart playing in a living room? The whole idea of mystery is out the window,\" he said.\n\nThe high price of guitars, Salas added, doesn't help. \"When I was a kid, I could buy a [Gibson] Les Paul guitar for 400 bucks,\" he said. \"Is a 16- year-old going to spend $3,000 on a Les Paul guitar? Are you kidding me? The prices have gone bananas on guitars.\"\n\nSalas, who recently produced \"Rumble,\" a documentary about Native American influence on rock music, said he recently met with a Korean guitar company in Amsterdam who said they could make a Fender Stratocaster for $23. A standard Fender Stratocaster retails for a price of around $1,300.\n\nSalas added at the other end of the market, the budget guitar market is harming the industry. \"It doesn't do a brand well when you see Gibson, Fender and Epiphone guitars flooding Costco COST, +0.96% and Walmart WMT, +0.82% in those $99 packages.\"\n\nHook, who covered the economics of running a nightclub in his 2009 book, \"The Hacienda: How Not To Run a Club\", predicted: \"The guitar companies are going to restructure and get smaller. The true artist in the company -- the guy who builds a guitar by carving it out of a piece of wood hopefully will be the one that will be celebrated, not the middle management.\"\n\nThe popularity of hip-hop and rap music has also affected the guitar's popularity. \"The era of the guitar hero and rock star being a central part of the pop culture lexicon is long gone,\" said James Wengrow, an Australian guitarist who teaches at the New York City Guitar School. Since the 21st century, \"electronic music production has increased with software facilitating new terrain for creators. Synthesizers, keyboards and electronic drums are now the norm in pop music sound.\"\n\n\"Hip-hop has essentially replaced rock 'n' roll as the music of youth,\" he added. \"I think this is a good thing and there is a lot of groundbreaking music of this kind being created but it does mean less kids are idolizing electric guitarists so fewer guitars are being bought.\"\n\nWengrow said that Gibson got outmaneuvered by its competitors. \"In the 1950s and 60s, it was really just Fender and Gibson as the two main guitar makers and they became the standard bearers. But other guitar makers such as Ibanez, Jackson, Yamaha and Paul Reed Smith, came to existence and copied their standards but continually updated many features and customizations that better reflected the idiosyncrasies of the times, often for cheaper prices.\"\n\nHe added, \"Gibson simply rested on their laurels of the great models they had built decades past, and didn't keep up with the innovation of the times both in the guitar-builder market, and broader cultural trends.\"\n\nThat's not to say Gibson always met expectations during its storied past. \"I dreamed of having a Gibson guitar and I achieved that dream,\" Hook said. \"It was a hollow-bodied EB-1 [a bass guitar] but it was medium scale so it was a s--t guitar and it sounded like s--t and I had to put new strings and a new bridge on it. It still sounded duff so I copied the shape and amalgamated it with a Yamaha.\"\n\n\"I had a custom guitar made with a Gibson body, because it allows it to feed back, with a Yamaha neck and Yamaha electric. I still play it today.\"\n\nSix-string bass guitar played by Peter Hook of New Order.., pic.twitter.com/FmfBmlaOSO -- Jim McCabe (@Macca00)\n\nJune 24, 2017\n\nHook isn't worried the current challenging economic pressures will jeopardize the guitarist's iconic status. \"The guitar hero will never go away,\" he said. \"People adore this image of the guitarist almost being like a cowboy. You will always see the odd-looking kid walking down the street holding a guitar -- there just might not be as many of them.\"\n\nSalas is also bullish about the guitar's prospects. \"My 10-year-old son is at school in Austin, Texas and him and his friends are rocking out to 1970s funk,\" he said. \"A new generation is getting into guitar and rock'n'roll. I believe there's going to be a massive comeback and that means with that style of music the electric guitar is going to make a comeback.\"\n\n\"Whether Gibson can fix its business practices is another story,\" he said.",

The Nasdaq COMP, +1.17% most recently was up 1.1% at 7,165 on the back of Apple Inc. AAPL, +3.26% hitting a record high on a report that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.A, +0.85% BRK.B, +0.62% acquired 75 million shares of the iPhone maker during the first three months of 2018, increasing its investment in the company. The bounce in shares of the most highly valued company in the world, helped to push the broader market high, but had a decided effect on the market-value weighted Nasdaq. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average [: DJIA], where Apple is also a major component, was rallying, up 214 points, or 0.9%, at 24,144, while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.77% climbed 0.7% at 2,649.",

                "title": "How retirees should react to the dollar",
                "body": "Would a stronger dollar help retirement investors, or hurt them?\n\nIs a strong dollar good for retirees' portfolios, or is it bad? Or does it make any difference?\n\nDon't be too hard on yourself if you don't know the answer and find the whole subject confusing. You're in good company, in fact: You may recall that, soon after taking office, President Trump called his National Security adviser at 3 a.m. to ask whether he should prefer a stronger or a weaker dollar.\n\nResearchers aren't much help either. A review of on-line articles in preparation for this column found some claiming that stocks fall when the dollar rises and others claiming just the opposite.\n\nPart of the reason everyone is so confused is that the relationship between stocks and the dollar is not stable over time. In some decades the correlation between the two is positive, and in other decades it is negative.\n\nTake a look at the accompanying chart, which reflects data back to the early 1970s, which is when the U.S. dollar's foreign exchange value began being set by the market. (The chart reports the correlation coefficient, which is a statistic that measures the extent to which two data series move together. The coefficient is positive when the two rise and fall in tandem, with a reading of 1.0 representing the highest possible degree of correlation. Negative coefficients mean that the two data series tend to move in opposite directions, with a reading of minus 1.0 representing a perfectly inverse correlation.)\n\nAs you can see, the stocks-dollar correlation was positive in the 1970s, negative in the 1980s, then positive again in the 1990s, and has been negative since.\n\nThis unpredictable and varying relationship is exactly what we should expect, according to Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University. That's because, he told me in an interview, the relationship between stocks and the dollar is not a cause and effect relationship.\n\nThe only retirees whose portfolios would be immediately affected by changes in the foreign exchange value of the dollar are those who invest in foreign stocks or bonds, either directly or via a mutual fund or ETF. For them, a weaker dollar is a good thing, since it means the dollar-denominated value of foreign earnings and dividends will be higher than they would be otherwise. By the same token, a stronger dollar would lead to a diminution in the dollar value of those earnings and dividends.\n\nFor U.S. domestic firms, in contrast, the situation is a lot murkier. Most firms that derive a big portion of their sales outside the U.S. also have extensive operations outside the U.S. as well. (Can you say Apple?) Such firms are inherently hedged against currency fluctuations, since they will by hurt in one part of their income statement to more or less the same extent that they are helped in another part. And to the extent that firms have extensive exposure to foreign currency fluctuations -- that is, their non-dollar sales and expenses are not balanced -- they typically will hedge that risk.\n\nNo wonder the stocks-dollar correlation is so inscrutable.\n\nI hasten to add that this doesn't mean the dollar's fate isn't important, or that it has no impact on the economy. But because the relationship is so complex, and because a strong dollar is good news for some companies and in some situations and not others, it's not clear how and what you should be worrying about even if you wanted to fret about the dollar.\n\nTherefore, if your portfolio doesn't contain foreign stocks or bonds, you probably can safely ignore the dollar's value vis a vis foreign currencies. There are plenty of other things that are more deserving of your concern and focus.\n\nFor more information, including descriptions of the Hulbert Sentiment Indices, go to The Hulbert Financial Digest or email mark@hulbertratings.com.",

                "body": "U.S. stock-index benchmarks on Friday slumped at the open, with all the main equity gauges set for a weekly drop, after a report on April jobs showed that fewer-than-expected jobs were created in the month, while wages grew at a cooler-than-expected pace. The Labor Department showed that 164,000 jobs were created in April, below the 188,000 estimated. Separately, the unemployment rate fell to 3.9% from 4.1%, the first time the jobless rate has dropped below 4% since the end of 2000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.32% meanwhile, slipped 120 points, or 0.5%, at 23,812, the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.29% fell 12 points, or 0.5%, at 2,617, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.14% retreated by 20 points, or 0.3%, at 7,067. For the week, the Dow is set for a decline of 2.2%, the S&P 500 is poised for a 2% drop, while the Nasdaq is on track for a weekly fall of 0.8%. Also driving sentiment was a focus on global trade tensions, with China and the U.S. holding tense talks in Beijing to resolve their tit-for-tat trade spat. In corporate news, Apple's stock AAPL, +1.67% is likely to be in focus after CNBC reported that Warren Buffett acquired 75 million shares of the iPhone maker in the first quarter.",

Riley analyst Barton Crockett upgraded the stock to buy from hold after the results, arguing that shares are \"worth a shot\" due to some near-term prospects. \"We see a number of meaningful business improvements imminently upon us that could inflect Pandora's profile from fallen Internet star to reinvigorated programmatic audio/margin growth story under new management,\" he wrote. Opportunities for growth include the introduction of family plans, which is due to take place this quarter. The plans are popular with users of rival services from Spotify Technology SA SPOT, -0.32% and Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.36% Crockett also likes Pandora's acquisition of programmatic ad-tech company AdsWizz, which should be completed this quarter. \"AdsWizz is also a platform for multiple services, including iHeartRadio, Deezer (and for now, Spotify),\" Crockett wrote. He raised his price target on the stock to $8 from $6. Pandora shares were down 46% over the past 12 months as of Thursday's close, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.36% had gained 10%.",

                "body": "Capex responding to strong demand and tight supply, not the gift from Washington\n\nEveryone is talking about employment today, (which makes sense since it's \"Jobs Friday\") but I'd like to talk about another economic statistic that's more important for the long run: Capital spending.\n\nYes, capex investment might seem like a boring topic compared to Stormy and Rudy and Kanye and even the labor-force participation rate, but I'd argue that the course our economy takes over the next decade depends to a large degree upon the decisions that business leaders are making right now about how much capital to deploy back into their business and how much to return to owners.\n\nIf we want more jobs, higher wages and a more productive economy later, we need to invest now in offices, factories, computers, machinery, trucks, software, research and development, and a thousand other essentials that make businesses run.\n\nThe good news is that corporations are increasing their investments again after a slump in 2015 and 2016. Over the past year, real business investment has increased at a 6.1% annual rate, according to the Bureau of Economic Affairs in the Commerce Department. It's a good number, but nothing jaw-dropping.\n\nThe bad news is that net investment is very weak by historical standards. Companies have loads of cash, but little is going back into the business.\n\nThis dismal trend may be about to change for a very good reason: Businesses are reporting that strong demand is running up against the economy's capacity (including imports). Supply chains are tight, and prices are rising for goods and services in short supply. The natural response by profit-maximizing companies would be to expand their capacity rapidly to meet demand, and to some extent that seems to be happening.\n\nAccording to an analysis by equity strategist Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse, capital spending by large companies in the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.23% is on pace to increase 20% year-on-year, based on the companies that have already reported their first-quarter earnings.\n\nTwo-thirds of the first quarter's dollar increase in capex comes from just 10 companies.\n\nBut Golub cautions against seeing the pickup in capex as a broad trend. It's concentrated in just a few sectors and in stocks \"with higher [return on equity] opportunities,\" he wrote in a note to clients. Two-thirds of the dollar increase in the first quarter comes from just 10 companies: Alphabet GOOG, -0.06% General Motors GM, -0.14% AT&T T, -0.37% Verizon VZ, +0.19% Walmart WMT, -0.13% Amazon AMZN, +0.15% Microsoft MSFT, +0.60% Intel INTC, -0.06% Micron MU, +1.59% and Charter Communications CHTR, -1.24%\n\nThere's another reason, of course, why companies might be expected to increase capital spending: The $1 trillion corporate tax cut that took effect on Jan. 1. Getting companies to invest more was the stated objective of the Republican office holders who pushed it through. They said letting companies keep more of their profits would lead to a surge in capital spending that would, in turn, boost the productivity of the economy and make the economy grow at 3% (or more) again year after year.\n\nAside from anecdotes, there is little evidence so far that companies have been motivated by their tax savings to invest more. The hard data don't show any sizable increase since Jan. 1 (insert the usual warning to never take one quarter's gross domestic product as definitive proof of anything).\n\nIn the first quarter, the government estimated, real nonresidential investment in structures, equipment and intellectual property rose at a 6.1% annual rate, down from 6.8% in the fourth quarter and 7.1% in the first quarter of 2017.\n\nInvestments in structures rose at a 12.3% annual pace, the fastest in a year, but they fell if you exclude the big rebound in oil and gas drilling. Investments in equipment rose at a 4.8% annual rate, the slowest in a year. Investments in intellectual property increased at a 3.6% annual rate, about in line with the average for the past five years.\n\nIn a word: unremarkable. There was nothing in the GDP investment data that pointed to any significant surge due to the tax change. It was just business as usual, reacting to the opportunities in the market.\n\nThere is little correlation between the companies that got the biggest tax breaks and the companies that are investing the most. Google got a huge tax break and boosted capex by a lot, but Apple AAPL, +0.18% got the biggest break of all and announced that it would return almost all of its windfall to shareholders. General Motors invested $6.7 billion in the first quarter (the second-most of any company), but actually lost money on the tax cuts.\n\nSeveral companies announced capital-spending plans following the tax cut, but an analysis by the admittedly hostile Americans for Tax Fairness found that most of the \"new\" capex spending by companies such as Apple, Comcast CMCSA, -0.93% and ExxonMobil XOM, -0.34% wasn't new at all, just a continuation of previous trends.\n\nSo far, American corporations seem to be doing just what most economists expected them to do: Return the bulk of their tax-cut windfall to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. It's not a lack of capital that's holding back investments in the American economy, it's a lack of imagination.\n\nSo, the plan is to give the money to the people who already have more than they know what to do with. And even the most imaginative of our modern magnates can't think of much to do with his fortune except build a rocket ship so he can escape.",

                "body": "Shares of Universal Display Corp. OLED, -0.98% are down 1.1% in premarket trading Friday after the company missed revenue expectations the prior afternoon. The company, which make organic light-emitting diode technologies that go into smartphone and other screens, pointed to a \"soft premium smartphone market\" in the first half of the year but said it expected \"a pick-up in OLED panel demand\" in the second half. Analysts weighed in on the results Friday, including Evercore ISI's C.J. Muse, who rates the stock at outperform with a $150 price target. \"While Universal Display's results for 1Q...and revised guide for all of CY18 were disappointing, the key is that this report should represent a bottom,\" Muse wrote. \"The good news is we believe this will be the last cut and that the long-term story is mostly unchanged. While the Apple AAPL, +0.18% OLED super-cycle obviously did not materialize, this fact alone does not suggest the excellent benefits of OLED vs. LCD will not be realized in handsets in the coming years.\" Needham analyst James Ricchiuti lowered his price target to $130 from $170 but said that new revenue-recognition standards negatively impacted results. \"With signs increasingly pointing to a 2H recovery in the OLED market, we believe investors have another opportunity purchase OLED shares at sharply lower prices before the impact of next wave of OLED capacity, notably in China, begins ramping next year,\" he wrote. Universal Display shares are down 47% so far this year, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.23% has fallen 1.6%.",

                "body": "Not many will be sorry to see a choppy, bruising week for stocks come to an end. But that doesn't mean it hasn't had its moments -- and a couple of intriguing moves.\n\nOne of the few S&P 500 standouts is Apple, headed for a 9%-ish gain this week after pulling another earnings rabbit out of the hat. Not too shocking, then, that Warren Buffett is hugging up to the iPhone maker. (More below on that.)\n\nIn addition, stocks have tossed out some interesting technical signals -- and that's put some market watchers on alert.\n\nThe Dow busted through its 200-day moving average on Thursday, for the first time since early April. The S&P 500 also briefly fell through that level, which can be a bearish sign.\n\nAmong those keeping a close watch is Sven Henrich of the Northman Trader blog, who provides our call of the day. He says it's not just the 200 MDA investors need to look out for, but also a lower trend line of support for the index.\n\nThat line connects the S&P lows seen just after Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election with those seen during last February's meltdown.\n\n\"Bulls cannot afford to lose this lower trend line,\" Henrich tells MarketWatch, providing the chart below. It shows the 200-DMA (red), 100-DMA (green) and then the lower trend lines (blue).\n\n\"Every tag of this trend line since February (six times) has been defended, including yesterday,\" he notes, adding that the 200 DMA has also repeatedly held its ground.\n\nHowever, Henrich explains that the more often a trend line gets tested, the weaker it gets as a support level for stocks, and may eventually break.\n\nOn the downside, he said investors should watch out for potential headwinds from seasonal weakness into summer and fall, as mid-term election years tend to add extra uncertainty.\n\nThe market\n\nDow YMM8, -0.19% , S&P 500 ESM8, -0.21% and Nasdaq NQM8, -0.22% futures are slipping a little ahead of the jobs data. Thursday was a wild day for the Dow, which eventually broke a four-session losing streak. The S&P 500 SPX, -0.23% and Nasdaq COMP, -0.18% fell modestly.\n\nAsian stocks finished mostly lower, with financials taking a hit. Europe's SXXP, +0.28% main index is headed for its longest run of weekly wins since 2015. Elsewhere, gold GCM8, -0.14% is modestly off, the dollar DXY, +0.13% is up, and crude CLM8, +0.47% is flat.\n\nBitcoin BTCUSD, +0.14% is back under $10,000, after taking aim at that level Thursday.\n\nSee the Market Snapshot column for more.\n\nThe chart\n\nOur chart of the day, provided by the Wall Street Journal's Daily Shot, shows how wheat prices have been climbing. Part of that is due to some pretty dismal crop conditions in Kansas, where drought and cold temperatures have wreaked some havoc.\n\nThe economy\n\nIt's nonfarm payrolls day. Economists are looking for a gain of 184,000 after a shockingly small 103,000 rise in jobs in March. Unemployment is tipped to drop below 4%, and average hourly earnings are in the spotlight, too.\n\nCheck out: What to watch in the April jobs report\n\nLots of Fed speak ahead as officials line up for a Hoover Institution conference. Watch for New York Fed chief William Dudley and then his San Francisco counterpart John Williams.\n\nThe buzz\n\nThe U.S.-China talks wrap up Friday, with trade war-sensitive markets watching for any light on agreement over tariffs and tech product restrictions. Treasury chief Mnuchin says talks are going well, but the U.S. has handed a laundry list of demands to Chinese officials.\n\nNewell Brands NWL, -0.60% is selling its commercial and consumer package manufacturing business The Waddington Group to Novolex, and expects to see $2.3 billion from that sale.\n\nBuffett's Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, -1.17% BRK.B, -0.88% scooped up a whopping 75 million shares of Apple AAPL, +0.18% in the first quarter CNBC reported. \"It's an unbelievable company,\" the Sage of Omaha told the financial news channel.\n\nAlibaba BABA, +0.55% is in the earnings spotlight, with results due ahead of the open. Berkshire's results are coming after the close.\n\nPandora P, +2.13% is up after a nice beat. GoPro GPRO, -0.20% could pop higher after earnings blew past forecasts, while Burger chain Shake Shack SHAK, +0.25% also delivered earnings beat and outlook boost.\n\nThe quote\n\n\"The crisis in the Swedish Academy has adversely affected the Nobel Prize,\" the Nobel Foundation said Friday in a statement.\n\nThat was in reaction to news the Nobel Prize in Literature for 2018 is being postponed to 2019, over allegations of sexual assault against Jean-Claude Arnault, the husband of member Katarina Frostenson. Three of the 18 members of the literature prize jury have quit over its handling of those claims.\n\nRandom reads\n\nFountains of lava leaking into residential areas as Hawaii's Kilauea volcano threatens to erupt.\n\nFormer Volkswagen COE indicted over emissions scandal\n\nA \"high purity\" nerve agent was used to attack a ex-Russian spy and his daughter\n\nMay the 4th be with you:\n\nWell done Heathrow. #StarWarsDay pic.twitter.com/fA5OcnXeYk -- Harry Neary \u1f4f7 (@Grumpyrocker)\n\nMay 4, 2018\n\nNeed to Know starts early and is updated until the opening bell, but sign up here to get it delivered once to your email box.

                "body": "U.S. stock futures dipped slightly on Friday, but traded in tight ranges as investors focused on the upcoming monthly jobs report, on watch for a rebound for jobs growth.\n\nTrade talks between the U.S. and China were also drawing attention, as the second day of discussions took place. The U.S. has reportedly handed Beijing's team a lengthy list of demands aimed at cutting the trade imbalance between the two.\n\nInvestors are bracing for another batch of earnings reports, from Alibaba Group Holding Inc. and others. Several Federal Reserve speakers will make appearances at a conference as well.\n\nWhat did the main benchmarks do?\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average futures YMM8, -0.19% were down 30 points, or 0.1%, to 23,880, while S&P 500 futures ESM8, -0.17% ESM8, -0.17% slipped 2.55 points, or 0.1%, to 2,629.25. Nasdaq-100 futures NQM8, -0.27% fell 13.50 points, or 0.2%, to 6,651.\n\nOn Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.02% recovered from a decline of as many as 394 points and closed up less than 0.1%, to 23,930.15, ending a four-session slide. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.23% dropped 0.2% to 2,629.75, and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.18% closed 0.2% lower at 7,088.15.\n\nFor the week, the Dow industrials were set for a 1.6% slide as of Thursday's close, while the S&P 500 was looking at a 1.5% fall and the Nasdaq at a 0.4% decline.\n\nWhat's driving markets?\n\nEconomic data could drive the action Friday, with key nonfarm payrolls data ahead. It comes in the same week that a Federal Reserve meeting left investors uncertain over the central bank's policy plan. Jobs data are among the figures the central bank uses in determining monetary policy, so a surprisingly good or bad number could strengthen or weaken the case for a rate rise.\n\nIn Beijing, U.S. and Chinese officials were meeting for discussions on tariffs and other trade issues. Worries about trade hostilities between the top two global economies have roiled financial markets in recent months. The U.S. has handed China a lengthy list of demands, the Wall Street Journal reported, including a demand to reduce the bilateral trade deficit by at least $200 billion by the end of 2020. The deficit stood at $375 billion last year.\n\nWhich economic data are in focus?\n\nNonfarm payrolls data for April are scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. An increase of 188,000 new jobs is forecast in a MarketWatch poll of economists, after the surprisingly small 103,000 rise in March.\n\nThe unemployment rate is expected to fall to 4%, after sticking at 4.1% for six months despite a steady pace of hiring. The report also includes the closely watched reading on average hourly earnings, with expectations for a monthly rise of 0.2%.\n\nRead: Unemployment close to breaking below 4% barrier: What to watch in April jobs report\n\nSeveral Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to speak on Friday. New York Fed President William Dudley kicks off the speeches at 12:45 p.m. Eastern at Bloomberg headquarters in New York, covering \"financial tumult of our times and challenges ahead.\"\n\nSan Francisco Fed President John Williams is set to appear at a monetary policy conference at the Stanford University's Hoover Institution at 3 p.m. Eastern. At the same conference, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Randal Quarles steps up at 5:30 p.m. Eastern to talk about liquidity regulation and the Fed's balance sheet.\n\nDallas Fed President Rob Kaplan, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and Kansas City Fed President Esther George are all slated to take part in a panel discussion at the conference at 8 p.m. Eastern.\n\nWhat are strategists saying?\n\n\"Barring a significantly disappointing [nonfarm payroll] release, today's data are unlikely to change market expectations of a rate hike next month. And should the data surprise to the upside, this could increase speculation that the Fed may need to raise rates more quickly than previously expected. Therefore, the release may provide limited dollar direction, unless there are any surprises,\" said Alexandra Russell-Oliver, FX analyst at Caxton, in a note.\n\nWhich stocks are in focus?\n\nAlibaba BABA, +0.55% VF Corp. VFC, -1.52% , Newell Brands Inc. NWL, -0.60% and Celgene Corp. CELG, -1.73% are on the earnings docket ahead of the market open.\n\nDon't miss: Alibaba earnings preview: Plenty of reasons to pay attention to payments\n\nAfter the close, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.A, -1.17% BRK.B, -0.88% is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings report. The company plans to hold its annual investors' meeting in Omaha on Saturday.\n\nCheck out: How Warren Buffett's stock picks for Berkshire Hathaway have performed in 2018\n\nApple Inc. AAPL, +0.18% shares could be in focus after CNBC reported Berkshire Hathaway bought 75 million shares of the iPhone maker in the first quarter.\n\nCBS Corp. CBS, -0.51% shares could rise in premarket trading, after the media company swung to a quarterly profit and reported a sales beat.\n\nGoPro Inc. GPRO, -0.20% could follow up a 9% jump in late trading Thursday, which came as earnings for the technology company beat expectations.\n\nPandora Media Inc. P, +2.13% shares rose more than 7% late Thursday. The streaming music company media posted an earnings and revenue beat.\n\nShake Shack Inc. SHAK, +0.25% shares jumped 6.5% in late trade. The burger chain posted an earnings beat and lifted its outlook.\n\nWhat are other markets doing?\n\nEuropean stocks SXXP, +0.18% were trading higher, while Asian stocks closed mostly lower ahead of the U.S. jobs report.\n\nGold prices GCM8, -0.24% inched down, while U.S. oil futures CLM8, -0.22% moved slightly lower. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.15% was up 0.2% at 92.561.",
